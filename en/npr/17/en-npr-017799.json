        "And according to Carol Tucker-Foreman, the testing of foreign meat recently became a little less thorough.",
        "If you want to send a product over here, before you can do that, our government has to go over there and inspect both the safety system that the country has and the safety system that the individual plant has and say these meet our standards.",
