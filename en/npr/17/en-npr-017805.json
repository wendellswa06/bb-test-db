        "How does pay at a regional airline, in this case, Colgan, let's say, compare with pay at a major national carrier like Continental?",
        "Are people making a lot less?",
        "Perhaps forced to live farther away from the airport they're flying out of if they're flying for the regional carrier.",
        "Well, starting pay at the major carriers tends to be somewhere around $30,000 a year.",
        "But it does top out much higher.",
        "And it's just a better job.",
        "It's a better working environment, from the pay to the schedules to the management and employee relationships, and so on and so forth.",

        "But should we feel that the B-team is in the cockpit when we're flying a regional airline?",

        "That's something that the industry needs to deal with also.",
        "We're having pilots being hired with 400, 500 hours.",
        "Back when I was first hired by a regional in 1990, the average was between 1,500 and 2,000 hours.",
        "Let me come back to the point where I began, which is with fatigue.",
        "This is not a 9-to-5 job, being an airline pilot, and how common is it to be flying when you really haven't had a night's sleep for many, many hours and frankly, when you might be more tired than you should be?",
        "Well, schedules at the regional level tend to be very fatiguing.",
        "I did it for a number of years, and it wasn't uncommon to work 12-, 13-, 14-hour shifts flying five, six or seven legs, takeoffs and landings.",
        "And then have a - what they call a reduced to rest overnight, where you maybe get five or six hours of sleep at the hotel, and then it's back to work for another long day.",
        "In fairness, we might get no better from the hospital resident who takes care of us after we've been taken there.",
        "True.",
        "And that's not to imply that these flights are therefore unsafe.",
        "But this is certainly an issue that needs addressing.",
