        "Well, they could be issues like attention deficit disorder, substance abuse, something called intermittent explosive disorder, which is another way of just saying people who have attacks of rage, violent anger which are incidentally much higher among those who enlist.",
        "On the other hand, you could say that these are the kind of people you want to be fighting your wars, is people who are very aggressive.",
