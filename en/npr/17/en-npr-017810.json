        "Well, one of the authors sort of states that hypothesis this way.",
        "He says, OK, war is hell and therefore people commit suicide because war messes them up.",
        "But it's really not that simple.",
        "There are clear indications that people who deploy, their chance of attempting suicide increases even many years later when they're back home.",
        "But it's also true that the rate of suicide in people who never deployed tripled over the same amount of time that was studied here.",
        "Brown, OK.",
        "Democrats called Trump's lawsuit yesterday meritless.",
        "California Congressman Adam Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, told The Washington Post today that Trump's lawsuit is part of an overall effort to curb the power of the legislative branch.",
        "First, Trump declared an emergency so he could spend money on a border wall with Mexico.",
        "Schiff said that was an attack on Congress's power of the purse.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Now he is going at Congress again to try to undermine one of our other most important powers and responsibilities.",
        "And that is the responsibility of oversight.",
        "To Noah Feldman, Trump and his attorneys may be playing a long game.",
        "They may be hoping they can persuade the Supreme Court to step in and strike down or, at least, restrict the subpoenas.",
        "But that may take a while.",
        "And in the meantime, lower courts are likely to side with Congress.",
        "And Feldman says without a court order to the contrary, big banks may have no choice but to comply with Congress's demands.",
        "That means giving investigators the records they want.",
        "Every bank is subject to intense federal regulation.",
        "And ignoring an explicit demand from Congress is not a good idea if you're a regulated entity.",
        "Deutsche Bank in particular has repeatedly run afoul of bank regulators over financial crimes such as money laundering.",
        "And the bank has made clear it's willing to cooperate with investigators and comply with any court order it receives.",
        "Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.",
        "Now, if you didn't win last week's three quarters of a billion dollar jackpot in the Powerball, do not worry.",
        "Here's another chance to play and feel like a winner.",
        "It's The Puzzle."

        "The four-letter word contains an S.",

        "Well, the adjectives are swift and fast.",

        "And this week, we only received a little over 250 correct responses.",
        "And our randomly selected winner is Vicki Magaw of Iron River, Wis.",

        "Thank you.",
        "How'd you figure this one out?",
        "Well, my husband and I go to breakfast every Sunday morning.",
        "And we listen to The Puzzle on the way to breakfast, and then we try to figure it out while we're eating.",
        "This particular week, we heard it, and we were just trying to think up five-letter words that started with S that had a synonym.",
        "And once we actually got to the restaurant and started writing them down, as soon as I saw swift and fast in print, I just saw it.",
        "And probably the fact that we were being waited on at the time had something to do with it.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "I was going to say, I mean, it seemed like the answer was right there all around you.",
        "(Laughter) Yep."
