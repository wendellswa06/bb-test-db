        "Do you absolutely need President Trump to support a compromise, or can you secure a veto-proof majority that would make that unnecessary in case he changes his mind?",

        "So I think that's probably more likely now.",
        "And there are three issues that have come up.",
        "One is, would the courts enjoin such a invocation of presidential power?",
        "In other words, would there be a lawsuit and be an injunction?",
        "And therefore, the money wouldn't actually go to the border, but it'd be tied up in the courts.",
        "I think that's likely from what I know of the way - people who would have standing, including folks along the border, including Democrats in the House as an example.",

        "The private and public polls showed that he was in the low-40s, but he cracked 48 percent.",
        "And that means Democrats did well enough last night that they will probably continue pouring money into all of these special elections.",
        "We've got another one in Montana coming up on May 25.",
        "Well, does this one special election race give us any sign for what to look for heading into the 2018 midterms?",
        "I think it tells us a couple of things.",
        "Number one, Democrats have a lot of organic enthusiasm, and there's some Republican disenchantment with Trump in districts like this one in Georgia.",
        "We know that Republicans still have a lot of structural advantages.",
        "They have a lot of resources.",

        "And to put all this in context, this district was very Republican, but there are about two dozen other districts out there that Hillary Clinton won and that are held by Republicans.",
        "The 6th District of Georgia wouldn't have even made it to the top 50 races the Democrats want to target next year.",
        "Now, on the other hand, the Democrats need two dozen seats to take the House back, so they do have a very steep hill to climb.",

        "She had to resign amidst that controversy over the cancer group's decision not to give grants to Planned Parenthood.",
        "That's a decision that was later reversed.",
        "But Karen Handel has impeccable pro-life credentials.",
        "She's a pro-life heroine for that Susan G.",
        "Komen controversy.",
        "We don't know if that's going to help her or hurt her in this district.",
        "During the primary, she kept her distance from Donald Trump.",
        "She was probably the most Trump-ambivalent of all the Republicans.",
        "But now Handel says she would be happy for the president to come in and campaign for her.",
        "Now, there is another bit of political news today.",
        "Jason Chaffetz, the Utah Republican congressman who chairs the House Oversight Committee, said that he is not running for re-election next year.",
        "What do we know about that?",
        "He says he's returning to the private sector.",
        "He's been very coy about his political future.",
        "He does say he will not challenge Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who said he will run next time.",
        "But Chaffetz might run for governor in 2020.",
        "He was asked about that recently, and he said that he's definitely maybe running for governor.",
        "I think what this tells us is that being in Congress is not necessarily the best platform right now for Republicans to run for higher office.",
        "And in general, a party trying to defend its majority in the House does not want a lot of these retirements because open seats are harder to defend than incumbents.",
        "So Chaffetz' decision was probably not good news for Paul Ryan."
