        "To hunt for clues about the origin of the beak, he and his colleagues studied various kinds of animal embryos and zeroed in on two genes.",
        "They're active in the middle of the face-forming region of bird embryos.",
        "Bhullar did an experiment to see what would happen if they blocked the effect of that activity in chicken embryos.",

        "I want to bring in NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley.",

        "Has the president already made up his mind that he's going to declare a national emergency, or is this just more posturing?",
        "That's a very good question, Rachel.",
        "You know, he - the president gave an interview to The New York Times yesterday in which he seemed to suggest that he is leaning towards declaring a national emergency.",
        "But you have to take that with a big grain of salt because of course, the - he's been hinting at that ever since this standoff began, and he hasn't pulled the trigger yet.",
        "The White House, like Senator Portman, knows that a national emergency would invite an immediate legal challenge.",
        "There would be opposition from some members of the president's own party, both on sort of constitutional and economic grounds.",
        "So it's not entirely clear the president's going to do that.",
        "And even talking about using a national emergency sort of undercuts the bargaining position of the Republicans on that conference committee.",
        "So it's an interesting stance for the president to be taking.",
        "You know, Senator Portman used to be a White House budget director, so he knows about the cost of shutdowns not only from a political point of view of a lawmaker, but the budget director is the guy who kind of has to manage a shutdown in the White House.",
        "And so he's certainly familiar with the cost on that end, as well.",
        "Just briefly, is Portman right?",
        "Have Democrats and Republicans all along been closer than the rhetoric indicates?"
