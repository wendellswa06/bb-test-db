        "And if you're going to pay for it, then that really means it needs to come out of these other tax cuts.",
        "And so in 2010 when all of these things sunset, they're going to have to sunset in order to fix the alternative minimum.",
        "It really is going to be that we have to make choices and I think that Congressman Rangel is right.",
        "If we're going to make a choice that ought to be in favor of middle-class and working families because they are the ones who have been hurt the most by the last four years.",
        "Mr.",
        "Niskanen, you know, when you take a look at President Bush's six years, so far, he really has taken great pride in his tax cuts.",
        "And yet, Democrats and even some Republicans have argued, look this is giving money back to the wrong people.",
        "How do you feel on that issue?",
        "Well, I favor the tax cuts.",
        "But they should've been paired with the spending cuts.",
        "And that's the key problem of the Bush fiscal policy, is that he has cut taxes in three or four occasion and he's had an unusually high rate of growth of federal spending.",
        "So I would favor getting rid of the alternative minimum tax.",
        "I pay a significantly higher tax rate, by the way, under the alternative minimum than I would under the regular income tax, because the deductions that I have do not count against the alternative minimum.",
        "And so the primary people who would gain by eliminating the alternative minimum tax are middle and high-income people and not low-income people.",
        "There would be a loss of federal revenues.",
        "I think something like 20 percent of taxpayers now pay the alternative minimum and that would go up over time.",
        "So there would be a loss of revenues.",
        "And I would favor pairing that with a significant reduction of a variety of federal spending.",
        "What would you cut in terms of spending?",
        "Well, I would cut what is roughly $100 billion of corporate welfare, particular subsidies that affect specific industries and firms.",
        "I would cut what is a huge over-bloated federal subsidies to agriculture.",
        "It is now over $20 billion a year.",
        "I think we will see within the next several years the significantly lower spending for military forces in Iraq and maybe even in Afghanistan.",
        "And I think those are the kinds of measures that ought to be considered in association with getting rid of the alternative minimum.",
        "When you mention words like corporate welfare and agricultural subsidies, you don't sound very much like a Republican."

        "Well, I think the Republicans in the last few years have forgotten their commitment to fiscal responsibility.",

        "It can cause growth to either favor everyone or to exacerbate inequality.",
        "And over the last four years, we've seen the income of those at the median, the people in the middle, fall while the economy has been expanding.",
        "That's a path that isn't in favor of middle class and working families.",
        "And I think the new policies, the sensitivity to those in the middle and to those at the lower end that you're hearing from this new Congress are going to be good for Americans.",
