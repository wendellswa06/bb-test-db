        "The SAS could have sailed in on a British warship, as others have done, or traveled in by land like many foreign journalists.",
        "Today, in Britain's parliament, the foreign secretary, William Hague, was peppered with questions.",
        "He confirmed the prime minister, David Cameron, knew in advance of the SAS operation.",
        "But Hague accepted personal responsibility for sending what he called a small diplomatic team to Libya.",
        "He said the mission was to make initial contacts with the rebel leadership.",
        "And added...",
        "They were withdrawn yesterday after a serious misunderstanding about their role, leading to their temporary detention.",
        "Hague said he'd be sending more diplomatic missions to eastern Libya soon.",
        "His answers didn't satisfy Ming Campbell of the Liberal Party, a partner in Britain's ruling coalition.",
        "Isn't it clear that this mission was ill-conceived, poorly planned and embarrassingly executed?",
        "Douglas Alexander, who holds the foreign portfolio for the opposition Labour Party, made fun of Hague.",
        "The British public are entitled to wonder whether if some new neighbors moved into the foreign secretary's street, he would introduce himself by ringing the doorbell or instead choose to climb over the fence in the middle of the night.",

        "In Tehran today, the government of Iran blinked.",
        "After intense pressure from the U.S.",
        "and Europe and the threat of more economic sanctions, it accepted a nuclear deal it has resisted for some eight months.",
        "If implemented, the agreement could see Iran shipping more than half of the uranium that is enriched out of the country.",
        "The president of Brazil and the prime minister of Turkey traveled to Tehran to negotiate the deal.",
        "NPR's Mike Shuster has the story.",
        "The original deal proposed by the U.S.",
        "last summer was meant to entice Iran to export much of the low-enriched uranium, or LEU, it produced.",
        "The goal, the make sure Iran would never use that uranium if it were enriched to a much higher level as the key explosive ingredient in a nuclear weapon.",
        "In exchange, the U.S., Russia, France and the International Atomic Energy Agency pledged to provide nuclear fuel for a reactor in Tehran that makes radio isotopes for treating cancer patients.",
        "Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, first accepted the deal but then opposition among conservatives and reformists in Tehran brought about a reversal in Iran's position and the deal has been all but dead until today.",
        "Well, I think that the history of the last couple of years in Iraq has demonstrated a number of miscalculations when it comes to the insurgency.",
        "They've clearly--the insurgency clearly has been much stronger and much more long lasting, I think, than the Bush administration ever anticipated.",
        "It seemed for a while that there was a big spike.",
        "It seemed to kind of level off for a bit.",
        "And now we're back into this incredible period of slaughter, really.",
        "Something like 700 people in Iraq have been killed in about the last month.",
        "And so I think it is a--it clearly indicates that the United States, the troops of the United States and the Iraqi armed forces are going to be in for a, big, long tough battle before this war is anywhere near being over.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yvonne.",
        "I tend to agree with Joe, but I guess where I have some reservations still is whether or not, you know, this was even the right thing to do.",
        "That boat certainly has sailed.",
        "But I think if they had looked at the history of the--that area in Iraq and seen who had gone there before and the problems that have been in existence for not decades but hundreds of years, I think there should have been better planning as to what needed to happen, as well as what was the resilience factor of the people that are on the ground.",
        "You have a lot of different religious factions and you have probably secular issues, as well, that I just don't think are really being dealt with.",
        "I think they used a Western strategy to deal with a non-Western issue, and I think that as long as that remains the case, we're going to continue to see miscalculations that are going to result in more casualties.",

        "We're all geniuses in hindsight.",
        "I think that what we're not talking about right here is something that has continued throughout the war and continues today even as we see a spike in the terrorist activity there, which is that young men continue to show up and volunteer at the risk of their lives, the lives of their families, to join the police force, to join the Iraqi national forces to protect the streets and to protect their families.",
        "They're--the tide is shifting there.",
        "I think that we absolutely need to be clear on who the heroes are.",
        "The insurgents there are not freedom fighters.",
        "They are fascists hiding behind keffiyehs.",
        "The heroes there are the young men, as I said before, who are fighting them.",
        "And I think it behooves us to do everything that we can to support their efforts.",
        "But, also, too, I think we have to be clear that there's certainly some ambivalence on the part of many Iraqis as to who are the freedom fighters and who are--is the enemy.",
        "Certainly, we have people who are coming forward who do want to bring about a new day in Iraq, but there are also, too, people who are really just not clear, and we have to acknowledge that.",
        "They're not sure they really want the American presence there.",
        "They're not sure they want to fight their fellow Iraqi."

        "And, you know, I think that this is not just a matter of saying everything is 20-20 in hindsight or even that the ship has sailed.",
