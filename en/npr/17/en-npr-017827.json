        "We won't get into the numbers that came to the polls, and that's my only point.",
        "All right.",
        "We'll move onto a different issue, and that's Minister Louis Farrakhan, who has now asked for a congressional investigation into the alleged desecration of the Koran by guards at a US prison on Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; this based on what was made--or what made a lot of news over the course of the last couple of weeks, and that's the Newsweek article.",
        "Newsweek, of course, has backed away from that premise that the Koran was desecrated by being thrown down the toilet.",
        "An investigation was had and released last week that suggested that there were some issues but not that particular one.",
        "Minister Farrakhan's point is there is, whether it be desecration by throwing the Koran down the toilet or not, there is an issue with the United States treatments--treatment of Muslims, as far as he is concerned.",
        "Yvonne, do you believe that there should be a congressional investigation?",
        "Frankly, I don't.",
        "I'm not sure that I'm going to totally buy the Pentagon's account, but I think more than li--it's more than likely.",
        "I'm willing to go along with the premise that there probably was mishandling.",
        "Some of it was inadvertent and some of it might have just been against what--their set aside protocols.",
        "That does not mean that I don't think that there might be prejudice or some bias against Muslims, but I think that we have to be clear that we can go over broad with some of these allegations, as well.",
        "I think that what we have to do is decide what is going to be a process that we're going to deal with in--when these allegations come up.",
        "I'm not sure that I like the government policing itself.",
        "I'm not sure in--at this juncture what the best process would be.",
        "But this Gitmo thing, it keeps resurfacing.",
        "We've had other allegations: Abu Ghraib.",
        "There's certainly something there and we have to get some policy that's going to--that's transparent that people can have some confidence in.",
        "Right now, things keep cropping up.",
        "We have these investigations and they really don't get to the core of the issue.",
        "So I don't know that another congressional investigation is going to really solve anything or put a--or even as a PR process, I don't think that's going to be very helpful.",
        "But I think it behoves us to find some process to get to the bottom of these allegations...",
        "All right.",
        "...when they come up.",
        "Joe.",
        "Well, I think that if there is going to be a congressional investigation, it would probably make sense for it to go beyond just the allegations involving the Koran.",
        "Amnesty International called Gitmo the gulag of our time, and many people think that's--it's overreaching, and it may well be, but that would be the purpose of any investigation, it would seem to me, is to find out exactly what happened, when it happened, why it happened, how up--and how high up the responsibility goes.",
        "Joseph?",
        "You know, I'm sorry.",
        "I was just sitting here trying to remember--and I may have missed it--the news conference held by Farrakhan denouncing the shredding of Bibles by Muslims, the murder of innocent men, women and children by Muslims, the desecration of religious icons by Muslims.",
        "You know, after--coming on the heels of Memorial Day, I'm just a little bit offended by some of this talk that's going on.",
        "Americans have shed blood and defended Muslims all over this world, and I would like to see Minister Farrakhan or some prominent Muslim cleric stand up and give us some credit.",
        "The treatment of the detainees at Guantanamo has been extremely humane, given prayer mats, Muslim clerics coming to help them worship, special food, people bending over backwards to make sure that the Koran is not desecrated.",
        "I mean, it's just--it boggles the mind that--you know, that we're having this conversation.",

        "So while I agree with you credit should be given, that doesn't supercede the idea that if something is wrong it should be looked into.",
        "Well, absolutely, and I think that, you know, the Army there--and I think that--my point is that we are bending over backwards not to have this kind of thing with--sensitivity training for the guards.",
        "And, I mean, I read a report they issued...",
        "But does that mean if there's a lot of good going on, the bad should not be investigated?",
        "No, what I'm saying, really, is that I think that this is a thinly veiled effort to embarrass the administration and embarrass the war effort.",
        "I mean, listen, Muslims are not...",
        "But, you know, in the eyes of many people in Muslim countries, these kinds of allegations are like probably a minor part of their frustrations and anger toward the United States.",
        "They've have these--this anger towards the United States certainly since this--the invasion of Iraq.",
        "And so these...",

        "Well, you see, I think the big problem is the invasion of Iraq overshadows everything for people in the Muslim world.",
        "It simply overshadows everything.",
        "No matter how much good the United States might have done, the invasion of Iraq kind of just basically overshadows that totally.",
        "And, also, too, certainly there has been good, but, again, we don't have a transparent process, when these allegations linger in the air for weeks at a time, you add fire to the flames.",
        "So that's why I'm suggesting that I--again, I'm not sure that I would go along with a congressional investigation, but it has to be a quicker, transparent way of looking into these allegations.",
