        "It's stuck in the courts in Florida.",
        "Nothing is getting done there, and they should do something about it.",
        "This is really a stretch here, but if the Democrats, if the Democratic Congress votes to override the sanctioning of this vote and the election is declared - the seat is declared vacant, you're going to have such an uproar, such an anger coming out from both sides in the House that will make the 2000 election look like kids playing in a sandbox.",
        "The emotions are very raw now between the parties.",
        "We see it in Iraq, we see it in basically every issue.",
        "And if the Republicans get these elections taken away from them, as some Republicans fear could happen, you will really see all hell break loose.",
        "So is there likely to be a recount?",
        "Is there likely to be a second election?",
        "What's going to happen?",

        "But, ultimately, I think that they're not going to reverse it.",
        "Although there is some precedent in 1984 in Indiana.",
        "There was a victory, a very close race where the Republican secretary of state and the Republican apparatus in Indiana gave the Republicans the victory.",
        "The Democratic House voted to unseat that and gave it to the Democrats.",
        "And again, as we say, all hell broke loose.",
        "And that was one of the reasons cited by the Republicans when they were elected to the majority in 1994 that it was abuse of power, the Democrats were abusing their power.",
        "And we'll see what happens here.",
        "Political junkie Ken Rudin, who writes a column by that name on Web site.",

        "President Bush made three recess appointments while Congress was adjourned for the Easter break.",
        "Given that such appointments are intended to allow vacancies to be filled rather than wait for an extended period for Congress to reconvene, President Bush's appointment of individuals who would never have gotten congressional approval seems to be a clear abuse of power.",
        "Why does no one challenge the legality of these backdoor appointments?",
        "Well, I mean, the president has the absolute right to do that.",
        "We saw that with Bolton at the U.N.",
        "It was a recess appointment knowing that the Senate would never…",
        "The committee.",

        "No, because they have the power to do it.",

        "These are clearly consensus-building, you know, kinds of measures that are being taken.",
        "It's awfully hard to build a consensus where there's so much political fear about the fallout from any measures that are undertaken about the war.",
        "So I think there are probably lots of viewers like me who feel that these are consensus-building measures and they are important for that very reason.",
        "Ken Rudin?",
        "The caller is absolutely right, but there's also a constituency in the Democratic Party which is angry, which wants U.S.",

        "They're talking about adding a minimum wage language to it as well.",
        "The Democrats obviously need to get something out of it to go home to their constituents and say, look, this is the best we got.",
        "And so I would think that the Katrina stuff, which is really not pork.",
        "I mean, you know, there are two separate things here.",
        "There is pork and there's also much needed legislation to finance the ravaged areas in the Gulf Coast.",
