        "No, Vanderjagt is a big guy.",
        "And the physical part of kicking has definitely evolved up.",
        "Kickers and punters are much bigger on average - 6'3\", 6'4\".",
        "Some of them are 220, 230 pounds.",
        "But what wasn't changed entirely is the notion that kickers are interchangeable.",
        "They're the most disposable players in the NFL, which is already a culture of disposability.",
        "When Dallas got burned last year with a bunch of missed field goals, they decided to give Vanderjagt, two and a half million signing bonus and another $800,000 or so in salary.",
        "No the team is quickly reverted to the old thinking that kickers aren't worth it.",
        "This week Cowboys owner Jerry Jones told a Dallas radio station that he'd never invest big in a kicker again.",
        "And as a chronicler of the picking game, you don't agree with that.",
        "No, I think, it's just bad business.",
        "The most expensive kickers in the NFL rarely take up more than the average amount of space on a team's salary cap.",
        "Even though, they can have a disproportionate influence on the outcome of games.",
        "No position has evolved as much as the kicker.",
        "In the 1970s, kickers made fewer than 60 percent of their field goals.",
        "Today, they make around 80 percent.",
        "And that brings me back to Vanderjagt, to replace him Dallas signed Martin Gramatica.",
        "Gramatica didn't play last year.",
        "He was beaten out in training camp in New England by a rookie this year.",
        "And he missed 40 percent of his field goals in 2003 and 2004.",
        "I hope the guy doesn't miss a kick, because I'm a kicker.",
        "But it does make me wonder about how some teams approach the position, which is more with hunches and emotions than real analysis.",
        "Meanwhile, the kicker for the Atlanta Falcons this year, Morten Andersen is 46.",
        "He's simply - I laugh every time I hear it - he's the second oldest player in the NFL history behind George Blanda, the quarterback/kicker who played until he was 48.",
        "Andersen is a freak a nature.",
        "His leg strength and his leg speed haven't deteriorated.",
        "I talked to him a couple of weeks ago after the Falcons played in Baltimore.",
        "He told me he wants to keep playing until he's 50.",
        "But we should point out that if a kicker - say on a kickoff, if the kickoff is returned really well, the place-kicker just might have to tackle some guy.",
        "All these guys are bigger now.",
        "And they can make tackles.",
        "Teams don't want them to because they don't want their $2 million Adam Vinatieris or Mike Vanderjagts getting hurt trying to stop a guy who's in all likelihood going to run right by him anyway.",
        "Jason Elam of the Broncos gave me some great advice.",
        "He said if I'm ever in a situation like that just get out of the way.",
        "Okay, Stefan.",
        "That's Stefan Fatsis of The Wall Street Journal, who talks with us on Fridays about sports and the business of sports."

        "In the last century our country and the world have been hit by three influenza pandemics, and viruses from birds contributed to all of them.",

        "Millions around the world died.",
        "He said scientists can't tell where or when the next will strike.",
        "But most agree at some point we are likely to face another pandemic.",
        "And the scientific community is increasingly concerned by a new influenza virus known as H5N1, or avian flu, that is now spreading through bird populations across Asia and has recently reached Europe.",
        "The danger for humans comes if that avian flu mutates in a way that allows for it to be spread from person to person, leading to a situation the president likened to a forest fire.",
        "If caught early, it might be extinguished with limited damage.",
        "If allowed to smoulder undetected, it can grow to an inferno that spreads quickly beyond our ability to control it.",
        "The funding request to Congress calls for $1.2 billion to purchase 20 million doses of a vaccine to defend against a strain of avian flu currently known to exist in Asian and European poultry.",
        "Though it's not likely an existing vaccine would be a perfect match for a particular influenza, the president said it would likely provide some protection.",
        "The proposal also includes $2.8 billion for research on new vaccines and money for a supply of antiviral drugs.",
        "White House adviser Dr. Rajeev Venkayya spoke to reporters in a conference call today."

        "While we can be hopeful that we will be able to contain an outbreak overseas, we can never guarantee this, and so we cannot ignore domestic preparedness, and therefore domestic preparedness represents the brunt of the budget that was described this morning.",
        "In the past the president has suggested using the military to help with any necessary quarantines in the event of a pandemic.",
        "He did not talk about that today, but his press secretary, Scott McClellan, was asked about it later.",
        "The military has been directed to look at ways that they can support the state and local communities in the event of a pandemic flu outbreak.",

        "The hurricane damaged not just the Gulf Coast but also public confidence in the federal government's ability to respond.",
