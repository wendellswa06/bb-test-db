        "I talked with Ms. Coltrane in 2004, just a few years before she passed away.",
        "And you know, she was blamed falsely, I believe for breaking up the classic John Coltrane quartet.",
        "So I wanted to know just how they met.",
        "And it turns out they met in New York, backstage at the jazz club called Birdland during the time when Alice was part of an opening act for the John Coltrane quartet.",
        "All right.",
        "So let's listen to what she told you about how their love affair began.",

        "So he's just sitting there.",
        "What did you say to one another?",
        "For a few days, nothing.",
        "He was a very quiet person, a person who's seen to dwell in his own universe.",
        "So I was sitting on one end side of the room and he'd be sitting there, always looking deep in thought in his face.",
        "You would not want to - no one would want to disturb that.",
        "So for days, ther3e was nothing to say.",
        "Finally after about three days, we began to talk about architecture.",
        "That was the first subject because I had brought up - I had book, drawings and paintings and whatnot, and some of them were unusual.",
        "And I said, you might want to take a look.",
        "And then it was an architecture and that's what we spoke about.",

        "You know, one of the pieces that you've done here - I told you this myself that I really, really, really liked - was about the artist Noah Purifoy who you interviewed way out in the Joshua Desert one time.",
        "Yeah, Purifoy was well into his '80s when I spoke with him and he'd become famous after the Watts Riots in 1965 when he literally took the wreckage from the riots and made protest art from it.",
        "He did it through an art form known as assemblage.",
        "When I talked to him, he was living in the middle of nowhere and downplaying the validity of protest art.",
        "(Soundbite of interview)",
        "And we sat down out of the sun under a canopy held up by two decrepit trailers.",
        "I wanted to get back to his thoughts on protest art.",
        "Well, I think it was appropriate.",
        "He said, as he lit a cigarette.",
        "It was a phase of evolution.",
        "And we all participated in capacity in which we were best known.",
        "But some African-Americans are still doing protest art because it sells well.",
        "But those who buy it are only trying to subdue to their own guilt.",
        "And I don't think an artist should spend a lifetime during protest art, even though it's popular.",
        "I think that protest art comes from the same place genuine art come from.",
        "It's just another layer which you have to get rid of to get the best part of yourself.",
        "Protest art is not the best part of yourself.",
        "It's underneath.",
        "So, I would only advocate protest art to get rid of my prejudice.",
        "So, you can hear in that piece that Noah was a chain smoker, huh?"

        "I realized that for people old enough to remember, this was burned in their memory.",

        "We had absorbed a terrible shock.",
        "We had very little sleep and we had no verifiable sources on the ground to give us information that contradicted that of the FBI.",
