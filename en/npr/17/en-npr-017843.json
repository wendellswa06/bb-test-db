        "The Department of Justice claims there was less to that story than was originally claimed, that, in fact, they're merely looking at a single lawsuit, not looking to overhaul American policy to attack affirmative action broadly across the country.",
        "On Friday, Attorney General Sessions announced this wide-ranging effort to root out leaks, which have been very rampant in the - under this administration to the great displeasure of the president and those in his orbit, announcing that he will re-evaluate the Department of Justice's guidelines on how they deal with leaks and potentially seek to target journalists more than is already done.",
        "And we should note, to be fair, the Obama administration targeted at least one journalist, James Rosen, who was - phone calls from...",

        "And then with General Kelly being brought in, he took this decisive action of getting rid of Anthony Scaramucci immediately.",
        "We've also seen some shaking up of the National Security Council and a lot of reporting out of the White House that he - that General Kelly is imposing discipline, is controlling access to the president and asserting his authority with the staff in a way that Priebus was never able to do.",
        "The question, as ever with Trump though, is whether it can be sustained and whether the president himself can be brought into line.",
        "Congress has gone home for the August recess.",
