        "These studies were done by Victoria Talwar, one of the world's leading experts in children's behavior, at her lab in McGill University, where she simultaneously observed children at play with their parents to overhear and see when are they lying, as well as she uses paradigms where they tempt kids to lie.",
        "Routinely they have them play a little game where they're tempted to, when the researcher's out of the room, peek to see what the toy is.",
        "And when the researchers come back in, they know what the toy is and they can win a prize.",
        "And they're meant to make these kids lie, and they do.",
        "And then they're also testing how well they can maintain the lie, you know, to try to make it sound plausible - sort of like what we were hearing from Clemens and McNamee defending their lies - and test their ability to do that.",

        "And in the experiment a parent watches their kid tell the white lie, the parent like cheers, like oh good, my kid can do it.",
        "And I've certainly been the parent to my young children who didn't tell a white lie and I'm terribly embarrassed.",
        "But what kids turn out to be, not growing out of learning to lie, but actually growing into it.",
        "And yes, they're telling white lies but they're learning to be disingenuous on a daily basis, and learn as you get comfortable with avoiding conflict by using dishonesty as a tool.",
        "So the white lie being, oh, I loved the gift when I really didn't love it.",
        "Right, the gift from grandma.",
        "Instead of getting you the action figure, you know, she gets you a book.",
        "So they're taking these white lies and they're kind of using the lesson to lie in general?",

        "Another thing - parents, we tell our kids not to tattle, don't tell.",
        "And we're doing the right thing.",
        "We want the kids to learn to have the social skills to work it out on their own.",
        "However, you know, tattling becomes one of the worst things a kid can be called on the elementary school playground.",
        "And it sort of becomes reinforced in a way that kids are learning to hide things from their parents.",
        "I'm not saying these are bad.",
        "I'm just saying this is the reality of how kids learn to lie.",
        "You know, about a third are going to become very pervasive, common liars throughout childhood, while other kids by the age of seven will kind of have the tendency mostly socialized out of them.",
        "And then in junior high you're going to see another spike, some because of the type of parenting they have, and perhaps what kind of behavior they have to cover up, are going to lie more and some are going to lie a lot less.",
        "So what's a parent to do if you want your child to, well - not not lie, because it's just not going to happen, but lie a little less?"

        "Echo isn't on forest service land like Vail or Breckenridge so there aren't no regulations requiring it to close on a certain date.",
        "That and it's location, 40 minutes from Downtown Denver, were what made it attractive to 60-year-old entrepreneur Jerry Petitt, who bought the land at an auction a few years ago for $700,000.00.",
        "I called my wife that night and said we just bought a ski area.",

        "Researching trends in the industry, he learned that all of the growth over the last five years came from snowboarders; specifically, from the terrain parks they flock to.",
        "Starting small, Pettit invested $5 million to develop the first 30 acres of his land into a terrain park designed by the same crew that did the Winter Olympics.",
        "But not before meeting with groups of local riders to hear what they wanted."
