        "Yeah.",

        "He'd moved to a different part in the country, and he'd been very intentional about people not finding him.",
        "I think, for Derek, the thing that mostly did the persuading was our national rhetoric and our national politics.",
        "I mean, when I first reached out to Derek, and he said he was not interested, over the course of the next year, all of these talking points from his past and many of the talking points that he had worked to spread over the radio every day or during speeches - all of these seeds that he'd planted - they were growing all around him.",

        "It happens because we do stuff.",
        "And I've been coming to the realization that it is harder to advocate for anti-racism than it is for white nationalisms.",
        "When you're saying that our society is fundamentally unjust, it is based on white supremacy, you're asking people to change and to do something and to sort of shoulder that burden.",
        "And that is a hard thing to ask of people, and it's a lot harder than telling them that things are fine and they don't need to do anything about it.",
        "Eli, what's your takeaway from Derek's story?",
        "Well, the president suggested that some of the reporting on the San Bernardino attack may have garbled public understanding of this.",
        "There was a story in The New York Times, for example, that suggested Tashfeen Malik, one of the killers, had openly posted about her jihadist ambition and that government officials had overlooked that when she applied for a visa to enter this country.",
        "Both The Times and Obama now say that's not true.",
        "Obama says the government does review public postings on Facebook, for example, when someone applies for a visa, but that's not where Malik's alarming communications were carried out.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "We're going to have to recognize that no government is going to have the capacity to read every single person's texts or e-mails or social media.",
        "If it's not posted publicly, then there are going to be feasibility issues that are -that are probably insurmountable at some level.",
        "And, you know, it raises questions about our values.",
        "Well, Scott, beyond terrorism, as is tradition at these year-end new conferences, President Obama talked today about some of his successes in 2015.",
        "What were the highlights there?"
