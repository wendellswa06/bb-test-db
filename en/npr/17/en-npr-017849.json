        "One area he's not seen a lot of cooperation with Congress is his effort to close Guantanamo Bay prison, which he announced his first day in office.",
        "This late in his administration, any hope for that left?",
        "Well, you know, there are some, like former White House Counsel Greg Craig, who argue the president has the authority to close Guantanamo without a green light from Congress, but Obama insists he's not going to push for that just yet.",
