        "That's right.",
        "Well, actually, it's not so much a change in tactics as in addition of tactics.",
        "As we began to work on prisoners of conscience, a lot of regimes began to realize that locking people up in prison was not the best way to silence them.",
        "So they began to engage in disappearances or killings or, in the case of Congo, which you just mentioned, women being raped as a way to punish them for their dissidence.",
        "So we began to have to work on, not just individual prisoners of conscience, but on these broader themes.",
        "But in every case, we continue to work on behalf of prisoners of conscience as well, but we just - there are so many thousands, if not millions, of people that couldn't be reached by just that one technique that we had to adopt many other techniques as well.",
        "As people might imagine, Amnesty International is more than occasionally at the center of controversy, including cases where you're writing on behalf of the release of people who are prisoners, who later turn out to return to activities many regard as terrorist.",
        "Well, I think - that does happen, of course.",
        "We never claim that the people that we work for are perfect human beings who are not capable of doing things that we would abhor.",
        "We don't write it on behalf of people because we like them or we don't like them, we write on them because they're human beings and every human being has certain basic rights.",
        "But in the case of the war on terror, well, we have taken up the cases of people who have not been charged or, you know, convicted of any crime whatsoever.",
        "This is a question of if people are guilty, they should be tried.",
        "If they're not, they should be released.",
        "And if you can't prove that they're guilt, as in our criminal justice system, you have to let them go.",
        "It's a question of values.",
        "It's a question of being able to have moral authority in the world, which, unfortunately, we lost in many ways during the years that we were locking people up in Guantanamo."

        "And I was wondering if Mr. Cox had any suggestions on how to keep young people involved.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's really good that you mentioned young people, because they are really flocking to this work.",

        "If anybody is listening and they want to get involved, they can go to amnestyusa.org and we will help them hook up with a group in their area.",
        "But young people, in particular, are hungry to make a difference, to change the world, not just to watch it and observe it.",
        "That's how I got involved, you know, nearly 30 - more than 30 years ago, and that's how people get involved today.",

        "I find this one sided reporting very disturbing.",
        "Well, I'm very happy to correct that information because that's not true.",
        "If you go to our annual report, which we publish every year so that people can see exactly what we say about every single country, you'll see that all of those countries, including the Palestinians, have been the subject of very strong Amnesty reports, very critical Amnesty reports."

        "We try very hard, as much as any human organization can do, to apply the same standard to all countries.",

        "I'm just curious on I think Amnesty does a wonderful job.",
        "I'm curious how you separate the real human rights cases from, you know, fakes, if you will, or people that aren't being persecuted but are actually being prosecuted.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The answer to that the short answer is with great care.",
        "Because increasingly, again, governments, in response to the success of groups like Amnesty International, have begun to charge people with criminal offenses rather than just lock them up, say, because they are guilty of threatening the state.",
        "And so, you have to do a lot of investigation to make sure that they aren't guilty of criminal offenses.",
        "We often will take up cases where the real issue is a fair trial, for example, where we're not sure whether they're guilty but we are sure that nobody can know because they have not received a fair trial.",
        "So we're extremely careful in trying to do just what you said, to separate out those who are truly being persecuted for their beliefs from those who have committed real crimes.",
        "Have you ever made a mistake?",
        "We make mistakes all the time.",
        "I think one of the things that makes us different from so many of the governments that we criticize, is that we have always admitted our mistakes as quickly as we can.",
        "We do that because lives depend on it.",
        "It's not an abstract thing for us.",
        "If we make a mistake and we don't correct it, the next time we bring up a case, someone is likely to doubt what we're saying.",
        "So it's very important for us to have the credibility.",
        "And when we make a mistake and found out about it, yeah, we immediately go public with it and say the information we have is wrong and here's the correction.",

        "He was acquitted.",

        "Enter a young Lawrence.",
        "Well, enter a young Lawrence, and although we all admire David Lean's film, not necessary the young Lawrence of \"\"Lawrence of Arabia.\"\" One of the points that I wanted to make strongly in the book is that Lawrence trained himself throughout most of his youth to be a great hero.",
        "He had in mind the liberation of Arabia.",
        "He strongly advocated it, but he also went through every possible training that he could inflict on himself to play that role.",
        "He didn't wander into the desert by accident and emerge out of it as a hero.",
        "He wandered into the desert deliberately.",
        "And he wandered into the desert, though, as a very junior officer, never at once - that clip, he's talking with the commander of British forces in the area, the general in command, and not intimidated by him one little bit.",
        "Throughout his lifetime, Lawrence was a remarkable combination of a man of extraordinary modesty and humility coupled with enormous arrogance and an absolutely uncanny ability to talk as an equal to generals, kings and presidents.",
        "Even as a youth, he never was held back the rank or by the social prestige of the person with whom he was talking.",
        "He had an almost unbelievable manner of getting his own way, even when he was an Oxford undergraduate.",
        "You write that he took his eyes off Medina when those were - that was the target his superiors wanted him to pay attention to and instead went around it and harried the Turkish lines of supply, the railroad line itself, and by doing so put himself in a position to then go on to accomplish the great goals that he foresaw for his Arab allies.",
        "He described, I think brilliantly, something which nobody else had seen, which was so long as the Arabs kept an entire division in Medina and another division protecting the hundreds of miles of single-line railway that linked Medina to the rest of the Ottoman Empire, that it was, as he put it, all flank and no front.",
        "Hundreds of miles of flank that the Arabs could attack all the way from any direction, it required only six or a dozen Arabs and somebody who knew something about explosives to blow up the railway line.",
        "And he also worked out, which I think was brilliant for a young man of 28, that not only could he keep on blowing up the railway line and of course killing Turkish soldiers who were guarding it, but that he never wanted to cut it completely, because if he did, the Turks might withdraw their divisions from Medina and add it to the troops who were in Gaza and guarding Jerusalem and the more important parts of the Turkish Empire.",
        "So his aim was always to inflict just enough damage to inconvenience the Turks without ever inflicting so much damage that they were forced to retreat."
