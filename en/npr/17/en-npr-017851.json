        "Derek, before I let you go, can I ask you, what's your life now - to the degree that you feel comfortable saying?",
        "In my day to day life, I am a graduate student of history trying to pursue that and figure out how it integrates into my life.",
        "And before I met Eli, I wanted to never speak in front of anyone ever again.",
        "And I delved pretty deeply into history thinking that that could keep me away from talking about now and talking about our lives.",
        "And since meeting Eli and these years of working with him to try to tell this story, I think I've come to realize that it's never that easy and that I have a responsibility to speak out about things that I have a weird platform to do.",
        "And sometimes that's not always pleasant.",
        "But I think it's important, and I'm still trying to figure out exactly how to do it.",
        "And your parents?",
        "We have a relationship, and that's due in no small part to them.",
        "It was not always clear that we would be able to talk, and a lot of love on their part went into realizing that it's more important that we be able to speak as a family than that that be cut off just because of beliefs.",
        "But there's a gulf there, and a lot of those conversations are about how I'm making the country worse by advocating anti-racism and that I'm going to doom America if I keep advocating this stuff.",
        "What do you do for Thanksgiving?",
        "I think, like a lot of college students, you left home, and then you come back, and you're hanging out, listening to the family conversations, and you're - have a new mindset, and you say, oh.",
        "I never really heard it that way before I left home."

        "Up until, you know, he died, every decision I made, I'd always call him.",
        "And he would never tell me what to do, but he would always listen and say, well, what do you want to do?",
        "And he made me feel like I could do anything that I wanted to do.",
        "I can remember when we integrated the schools that there were many times that I was just scared, and I didn't think that I would survive.",

        "If I could talk to him again, it would be all I could ask for.",
        "What would you ask him?",
        "I would ask more about his life as a youngster, growing up in the segregated South and how he felt about his lack of opportunities and how he was able to take care of his family, even though there were many restrictions on him."

        "Yes, but that's the original guilt.",
        "Lawrence's intense state of masochism in later life, his decision to turn down all his decorations of whatever kind, his refusal to accept far greater decorations which were offered to him, his final decision to erase himself completely by joining the Royal Air Force as an aircraftsman under an assumed name, the equivalent of a private -all of this comes from Lawrence's immense guilt at having driven and helped the Arabs to fight while knowing that the French and the British would not give the Arabs what they were fighting for.",
        "And in a sense, the Sykes-Picot agreement, which split up the Ottoman Empire, originally between the French, the British and the Russians, who were to get Constantinople, the Sykes-Picot Agreement is the original sin.",
        "When you look at the Middle East today - and you have to look at it to some degree through Lawrence's eyes, because Lawrence is one of the major creators of the modern Middle East - when you look at that today, you are seeing the consequences of not giving the Arabs what they wanted, of splitting the entire region up into relatively small and powerless states which were originally mandates or the equivalent of colonies of the British and of the French.",
        "Lawrence fought against that all during the war.",
        "He fought against it after the war, at the Paris Peace Conference.",

        "It's like coming into a movie halfway through and seeing one guy hit the other.",
        "But this movie actually began back in 1919 or so, and that's what we are living with.",
        "That's why a lot of people in the Middle East hate the U.S.",
        "and the British and the French because of what was done to them for 90 years.",
        "I think that's basically true.",
        "I also think that a point that has to be made about Lawrence is that Lawrence, apart from being a brilliant guerilla fighter and a self-trained hero, Lawrence had a very vivid picture of what the Middle East ought to be.",
        "It included the Jews.",
        "Lawrence was able to bring Anil Faisal(ph), the leader of the Arab army, and Chaim Weizmann, the leader of the Zionists, together in 1919 and sign off on an agreement which Lawrence drafted which would have created in Palestine a joint Arab-Jewish state with total equality.",
        "And which would have in the eyes of Lawrence and Faisal and Weizmann, allowed for an immigration of at least four to five million Jews into Palestine without encroaching on Arab land rights.",
        "Had that happened, who can say how different history might have been?",
        "The Jews might have been a part of a functioning Middle East.",
        "It would have been possible that at least three to four million Jews could have escaped from Hitler's grasp to settle in the Middle East in what is now Israel.",
        "There are a mountain of what-ifs that could have come out of a Middle East in which there was a powerful Arab state, not separated between poor big countries like Egypt and Syria and small, incredibly wealthy oil countries like the Persian oil sheikdoms and Saudi Arabia, but a Middle East in which the wealth was integrated, in which there was a place for the Jews, a totally different future.",
