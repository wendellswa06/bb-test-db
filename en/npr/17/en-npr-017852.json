        "No, he never assaulted the city.",
        "He negotiated his way painfully from step by step through various Turkish outposts that surrounded it in the desert.",
        "Lawrence was a great believer in not using force if you could avoid using force.",
        "He did not want to spend the lives of the Arabs he rode with.",
        "One of the differences between Lawrence and most other military leaders is Lawrence understood that the Arabs were essentially tribal raiders in which each death was a tragedy.",
        "There was no equivalent to the mass slaughter of the Western front and they would never have put up with such an equivalent.",
        "So he was very sparing of lives.",
        "Much of his guilt - that part of it wasn't associated with his feeling that he had failed to produce to the Arabs what they deserved to get - much of his guilt was to the deaths in the war.",
        "He felt very strongly about each one of them in a very personal way and I think you have to see the remainder of his life and that curiously sadomasochistic urge of his which fascinates people as a kind of self-punishment for what took place during the war.",
        "Let's see if we can go next to Silesh(ph) in Aligon, Michigan.",
        "Yes, thank you for taking my call.",
        "The question is simple.",
        "How is Lawrence perceived in the Arab world today?",
        "Is he even remembered?",
        "Alexander is remember as (unintelligible), is there an Arab name for him?",
        "I mean, in the movie they keep calling him Lawrence, Lawrence, you know, but how is he perceived in the world today, in the Arab world?",
        "And a small follow-up is, what is his association with India?",
        "I believe in his later life he had some association with India, if any, if you could just talk about that, thank you.",
        "I think the Arab world has great difficulty in dealing with Lawrence partly because his importance in the Arab revolt has been overrated in England to such a strong extent.",
        "That was not something that Lawrence himself desired.",
        "In Seven Pillars of Wisdom he makes it very clear that the triumphs of the Arabs was the Arabs' doing.",
        "He was an advisor.",
        "At times he was a leader.",
        "He was a gifted strategist but he worked in concert with them.",
        "So that there's always been a certain amount of Arab and in general Muslim resentment against Lawrence's fame which was enormously magnified by the success of David Lean's movie, \"\"Lawrence of Arabia.",
        "Today, I think Lawrence is a comparatively unknown name in the Arab world.",
        "Lawrence also severed his relationships in the Arab world after 1921 when he went back to England.",
        "There's a wonderful scene when - not in the movie but in real life - when Lawrence negotiated Abdullah's way to becoming the ruler of Jordan, and eventually the King of Jordan, in which Lawrence then dressed as a civil servant and a diplomatist in a dark suit and a pair of boots, is standing outside Amman.",
        "And the Bedouin tribes ride in from the desert and ride up to Lawrence firing in the air and shouting out as they pronounced his name, Oorance, Oorance, Oorance, Oorance.",
        "And a bystander of all things, a very literal-minded English policeman who was Winston Churchill's bodyguard saw this incredible scene of these wonderfully dramatic and glorious-looking people riding in on their horses and camels, shooting in the air and shouting Lawrence's name as they rode past him, and said that he stood there like a conquering hero, that he could have had an empire of his own stretching from Palestine all the way to the Persian Gulf.",
        "I think that's an exaggeration but if a perfectly ordinary English policeman could think that about Lawrence in 1921 it gives you some idea of what his incredible fame was like in that period and what a celebrated figure he was.",
        "That's indeed one of the most difficult things to cope in Lawrence, is that his fame is really rather like that of Princess Dianas.",
        "He was, from 1920 to 1935 when he died, perhaps the most famous person in the English-speaking world without ever being visible."

        "I think that Lawrence and I make this point very strongly in \"\"Hero\"\" that Lawrence spent his lifetime, his adolescent and his adult lifetime, ferociously repressing in every possible way his own sexual instincts until he had them completely I think almost 100 percent repressed.",

        "Yes.",

        "Well, you're very kind.",

        "And the same is true of \"\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\"\" except - and this is very curious - except for the battle scenes.",

        "And as a result, my Uncle Alex had in mind a movie in which Leslie Howard would pay Lawrence and which my Uncle Zoltan would direct, because he was good at desert movies, and my father would art direct.",
        "And he had a script written for it.",
        "The film never got made, largely because the government objected to a movie about Lawrence on the grounds that it would infuriate the Arabs and the Turks, and they didn't want to do either one of those two things."
