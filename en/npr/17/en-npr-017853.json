        "But I grew up surrounded by talk about Lawrence, surrounded by Lawrence's book.",
        "I served in the Royal Air Force, as Lawrence did.",
        "I was a motorcycle fanatic, partly because Lawrence was my example for that.",
        "So Lawrence seemed to me a very familiar figure, and I never found any difficulty in - either in reading his books or in puzzling out what he really meant, because his prose can sometimes be very difficult to penetrate.",
        "Hi.",
        "Yes.",
        "I guess I wanted to make a couple of comments.",
        "I'm actually half Saudi, half American, and there was a question about how Arabs perceive Lawrence of Arabia.",
        "And growing up in Saudi Arabia, I remember lots of references towards him very much in the positive.",
        "And it was usually said when the Americans or the Europeans - that general term again - were there on work visas and doing business and such.",
        "And I just think we remember back in the '80s a (unintelligible) gentleman whose name was Jim Lawrence - people would give him the nickname of, oh, this is our Lawrence of Arabia because he would wear (unintelligible) and he would wear the Arab dress and he had those blue eyes.",
        "And it was very(ph) used as a term of endearment, like, oh, here is a Westerner who actually gets to know the people, who embraces the culture, who respects the differences, who integrates.",
        "And I think that is the - at least from the Arab perspective - the respect that he earned.",
        "I think you're very right about that.",
        "I'm sorry?",
        "I think you're very right about that.",
        "I think...",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "...that one of the reasons that Lawrence was able to lead the Arabs is that from the very beginning he determined to lead their life.",
        "However little water they had, whatever their food was like, however difficult their life in the desert was, Lawrence shared it with them on equal terms, which no other European officer ever tried to do.",
        "And that made an enormous difference.",
        "He made himself one of them.",
        "(Unintelligible) today.",
        "Also you suggest because the Arab head dress made him look a little taller than his five-foot-three.",

        "Well, you know, as Arabs we're not that tall anyhow, at least many of us aren't.",

        "We appreciate it.",
        "May I make one more comment?",
        "If you would make it quickly, please.",
        "Yes.",
        "I also served in the military, and I think aside from the military strategy, a lesson to be learned is that, again, when you're going to a culture, learning the culture and using that culture and the terrain and everything to the advantage, as opposed to against you, say, as the Russians did in Afghanistan, you know, where Lawrence did the opposite.",
        "He really was able to use everything there to his best advantage.",
        "Thanks very much for the comment.",

        "I think it's a very shrewd comment, by the way.",
        "She's absolutely right.",
        "Finally, this email from Daniel: Your guest knows a lot about the past issues of Lawrence in the Middle East.",
        "So is there anyway to go back and correct the errors that were made in splitting up the Middle East?",
        "While we're splitting up the Ottoman Empire, there were Arab states that did emerge, as you pointed out - Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and of course Iraq.",
        "I think much of what Lawrence wanted to accomplish could probably be accomplished if on our side we stop treating the Arabs as if they were exotics and understood that what they fought for they failed to get from the Allies and that has colored their view of the West every since then.",
        "Not that their view of the West was particularly good before.",
        "And that the Palestinian-Jewish problem is a part of that larger whole.",
        "It's not the whole essence of the Arab grievance against the West.",
        "That would be one helpful thing, is to understand that we are teaching - dealing with people who have a rich, long civilization, but one which is radically different from ours in many ways and that we have to learn to accept, as they have to learn to accept us.",
        "The other would be - and it has been attempted by many people - you know, more of a coming together of the smaller Arab states into a larger Arab state.",
        "Lowell Thomas used to call Lawrence the George Washington of Arabia.",
        "There's still time for that.",
        "Michael Korda's new book is called \"\"Hero: The Life and Legend of Lawrence of Arabia.\"\" You can read an excerpt at npr.org.",

        "In the meantime, Michael Korda has been kind enough to stay behind in our bureau in New York.",
        "He's the author of the new biography of T.E.",
        "Lawrence, \"\"The Life and Legend of Lawrence of Arabia.\"\" \"\"Hero\"\" is its title.",

        "And I wanted to ask you.",
        "About the effect of Lawrence's celebrity, as you pointed out early in our conversation, he was very much at home with those who might have been regarded as his social superiors in those days when that meant a great deal more than it does now.",
        "Nevertheless, he felt weighted down by the expectations of fame.",
        "You know, I haven't.",
        "My oldest daughter, who was in the interview booth with me, she was the one who had the most contact with my father, and that's why she asked me that question, because she knew how special he was by personal contact.",
        "And what did she go on to ask you about your life?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, I think he felt weighted down from the very beginning of his life by the fact that he was illegitimate, one of the five sons of an English aristocrat who had abandoned his four daughters for their governess and then gone on to have five sons.",
        "He was enormously oppressed by - not only the knowledge of his illegitimacy but by a genuine and obsessive fear of sexuality.",
        "He felt in some way that the sexual desire between his father and his mother had been responsible for his father's immense loss of money, prestige, name even, because he gave up his name, Sir Thomas Chapman, to become Thomas Lawrence, and that Lawrence's pathway to a prevailing spirit of guilt and self-punishment opened up very early in his life, even while he was an adolescent.",
        "However, set against that, he was a man of enormous charm, of tremendous good humor, of extraordinary caring for others.",
        "He was perhaps one of the most brilliant and prolific letter writers of anybody in English history and had a gift for friendship which was almost unique.",
        "His friends included almost everybody worth knowing, from Winston Churchill and John Buchan to George Bernard and Charlotte Shaw, Thomas Hardy - you name it.",
        "Noel Coward.",
        "There is almost nobody of any consequence in English life between, I would say, 1960 to 1970 and Lawrence's death in 1935 with whom Lawrence was not on friendly terms.",
        "He was extraordinary personality.",
        "Magnetic is the only word that one can use for it, even though it's much overused.",
        "But it's true.",
        "A friend both to Winston Churchill, as you pointed out, and to Lady Astor, the woman who once told Churchill that if he were her husband, she would put poison in his coffee.",
        "And he said, and if I were your husband, Madam, I'd drink it.",

        "A few weeks ago, Bill McKibben, cofounder of the group 350.org, was on our program, and he was telling us about his plans to bring back to the White House one of Jimmy Carter's solar panels that was installed on the White House roof back in the 1970s.",
        "Ronald Reagan, after he became president, immediately took the panel down, and some of those wound up in storage.",
        "And Bill McKibben told us that he was going to drive down from Maine, take one of these panels that had been gathering dust on a college campus and try to have a meeting with the White House representatives and see if President Obama would symbolically put one of the panels back on the White House roof.",
        "Well, it didn't quite go so well as he had expected, and here now to tell us what happened is Bill McKibben.",

        "We'd pour a gallon of water in the top and point it at the sun, and six or seven minutes later we'd have steam coming out the bottom.",
        "So this 31-year-old technology is in good working order.",
        "We got down to the White House, and we had a meeting with the president, the leader of the Council on Environmental Quality and the Greening the Government initiative and things.",
        "And you're right.",
        "You don't need to go check Google Earth quite yet to see the panel on top of the White House because it's not there, nor is the sort of full, new array that a company called Sungevity had promised to provide free of charge."
