        "And do you hesitate to contact this woman?",
        "Well, she died, and it was funny that you had this subject because earlier today, I texted him - he called me this morning just to tell me, you know, Happy Thanksgiving and all that.",

        "So, yeah, go on - please do go on our Web site, and you can find all the questions you could ever want to ask.",
        "I was going to ask you to email me those questions.",

        "That sounds so funny.",
        "Well, now, here I am 35 years later, trying to be a part of keeping alive the sounds of '20s and '30s jazz, and one tune I remember him playing specifically is Duke Ellington's \"\"East St. Louis Toodle-Oo.\"\" And every time I hear the tune, every time I play it, I think about him, and I think what an opportunity I missed by - this man was active as a territory musician, playing bands that toured through the lower Midwest and beyond, probably, for all I know.",
        "And I just think what a golden chance I had to really pick a brain of somebody who was there, and I blew it.",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, you remember them, and it's important to get your memories of him down at some point.",
        "We also, you know, it really isn't just about interviewing family members.",
        "One of the partners this year on the National Day of Listening is the Corporation for National Community Service, and we think of doing these interviews also as an act of service.",
        "So whether it's the guy who lives across the street or someone in a veterans hospital or someone at a soup kitchen, you know, doing these interviews is a way to honor people - not only to preserve their memories and pass on their thoughts and who they were, but, you know, to tell them that their lives matter.",
        "So you missed that one, but there are plenty of other musicians, older people, around at senior centers and so forth.",

        "I very much regret that we didn't record it, and I encourage everybody to - that's thinking about doing this to do it before it is too late.",
