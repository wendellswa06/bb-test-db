        "I don't honestly know what kind of a plane he flew in World War II.",
        "Well, probably a fighter.",
        "That's probably why they brought him back, like Ted Williams, who came back and flew in Korea, as well, flying P-51s, I think during the Second World War and then F-86s in Korea.",
        "Yeah, that sounds familiar, as a matter of fact.",
        "Here's another email we have, another war story, this from K.J., also in St. Louis.",
        "One year after opening Christmas gifts, I sat down with my father.",
        "Daddy was a medic with the 501st Paratrooper Unit.",
        "He didn't talk much about the war.",
        "For the next four hours, he told a magnificent tale, from basic training at Fort Bragg to landing off coordinates from his unit on D-Day, facing German soldiers while protecting a farmhouse full of wounded soldiers to going through the Eagle's Nest.",
        "Now, I wished I'd had a tape recorder or a StoryCorps booth.",
        "Regardless, people need to ask about those stories.",
        "I will always treasure that time with my father.",
        "So remarkable stories, and that's a generation that is passing.",
        "Most everybody who is a survivor of the Second World War who participated has got to be over 80 years old, David.",
        "Right.",
        "And you know, I think when - what you hear, whether it's Carlotta's(ph) story or the email that you just read or, you know, Lynn Weaver's dad, Thurman Weaver, who's - the tape you played earlier today, I mean, these are - to me, this is the real American story and these are the real American heroes.",
        "It's the character and conviction and courage and kindness and poetry you find in the voices all around you that are the stories we should be celebrating as opposed to Balloon Boy and, you know, Ponzi-schemers and, you know, and these are the stories that really matter and the kind of stories we should be holding up to our kids as examples of who they can and should grow up to be.",

        "The StoryCorps stories, yeah, as Dr. Weaver said, you - the - a copy goes home with the family and then another copy goes to the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress so that not only your grandkids but your great, great, great, great, great grandkids can someday get to meet your father or mother or grandfather through their voice and story.",
        "And with the National Day of Listening, we don't have the capacity to take those interviews into the Library of Congress, unfortunately, but we do have something called the Wall of Listening, so you can register your interview and tell us who you talked to and what you talked about.",
        "And now, with technology on our side, you know, it's quite easy to, you know, burn CDs and make copies and you can - there are sites you can upload the audio to.",
        "And with a little bit of care, these recordings can survive for a long, long, long, long time to come.",
        "It's important also to make sure you preserve artifacts, letters, that sort of thing.",
        "But there is nothing quite the same as hearing somebody's voice.",
        "Well, that's, you know, the - you know, as your listeners know and as you know, the soul is kind of contained in the voice, so it's a very powerful - it's a very powerful way to document someone's life.",
        "And I think the structure of these interviews, and it sounds like what your -what the callers are saying, these - their interviews turn out much the same.",
        "The structures of a StoryCorps interview, it's kind of 45 minutes to sum up your life and 45 minutes to pass on what you've learned to the next generation.",
        "And it's a powerful and important act.",
        "And if you think about how to structure the interview, well, again, listen and your subject will often tell you the next question.",
        "But when in doubt, stick with chronology.",
        "You can depart from the timeline, but you ought to have a really good reason.",
        "In any case, we're talking with Dave Isay, the founder of StoryCorps and the National Day of Listening about that project.",

        "It's given me an idea for interviewing a cousin who is like my grandmother's first cousin.",
        "But I have interviews from my grandmother before she passed, but I would've loved to have been able to interview her grandmother.",
        "She was raised by her grandmother.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And in doing family history, yeah, I find out so much.",
        "And there's so many stories that I do know, but I would just love to touch her and to know so much more about her life, you know, about being - marrying a man who bought three farms down in the South and how she - in buying the farms, he couldn't go to the office and buy them directly, you know, because he was black, but had a friend pose as him in order to purchase those farms, and how they raised their children and how they succeeded, and just so much about her life I would love to know.",
        "One of the great questions for - to ask grandparents or parents is: who are your grandparents?",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, I did an interview with my mom at StoryCorps a little while ago, and I'm close to my mom.",
        "I didn't expect there would be much that I didn't know that we talked about, but I asked her about her grandparents and we'd never had that conversation before and it just kind of opened up this whole new world.",
        "That's true.",
        "It really does.",
        "You know, and I regret not having that opportunity, but I came home right before my grandmother, you know, unexpectedly passed away, and to have that time with her was incredibly special.",
        "And there were things that I told my mom that my mother didn't know about my grandmother.",
        "So I'm glad to have, you know, that time with her before she passed away.",
        "I'm glad you did that.",
        "You know, one of the - as you say, that one of the questions that's on that top 10 questions list, is there anything you want to tell me that you've never told me before or never told anyone before - which often turns out to be a very powerful question and a way for people to talk about things they've always wanted to talk about and get some closure on difficult moments in their lives."

        "It was - you know, it was more than a year into StoryCorps starting that I took my own mother into the booth.",
