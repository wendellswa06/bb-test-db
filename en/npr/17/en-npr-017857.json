        "It was one that he just came up with on the spur of the moment.",
        "And I think that part of the reason that that question really struck a cord with so many people is that, really, it's what we all want to know from our parents.",
        "We all want to know that - or you know, do you still - do you love us for what we are, rather than the person that you might have hoped that we would be?",
        "Yeah.",

        "And it was just such a profound question for a 12-year-old to ask that - it really struck me very much at the core.",
