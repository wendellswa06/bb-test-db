        "I would just say, you know, in defense of the doctors and everything, although it's not a very strong defense, is that they have thought until recently that there was a scientific basis for this.",

        "The only problems with that is it's not true.",
        "I mean, we don't know that there's any scientific connection between mood and immune system unless - and we know in one extreme, if you're really stressed in terrible ways and tormented, your immune system will be compromised by that.",
        "But we don't know that just being in a good mood ups your immune system.",
        "But furthermore, we're not sure - there's no evidence that the immune system is fighting cancer whatsoever.",
        "So there's no basis to this.",
        "Doctors have thought there was; there isn't.",
        "Right, well, this was as recent as a year ago.",
        "So anyway, I wish she were around to hear this because I remember driving back with her from chemo and her, you know, just questioning herself and what she knew about her body and how the doctors and nurses were insisting that no, she was getting better when, in fact, she was right that she was getting worse.",

        "So what I wanted to share was my almost reverse experience when I was diagnosed with a rare form of breast cancer three years ago.",
        "While I wasn't so much trying to be positive as determined and knowledgeable and wanting to take as much control of my situation and my body and my treatment as I could, what I actually found was people almost feeling sorry for me and, to some extent, encouraging me to feel all the negative feelings, the realistic negative feelings, and almost wanting me to wallow in what they said was such an unfortunate experience."

        "So I almost had the reverse experience.",
        "Where I was trying to be determined and take control, I found not so much that people were telling me to be positive, but that they were actually almost bringing me down by feeling sorry for me.",
        "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.",
        "Well, I guess I mostly ran into people who were trying to improve my spirits.",
        "And the worst of them, I remember, was a friend who said, oh, you're going to lose all your hair in chemotherapy, then we can see how beautiful your skull is.",
        "Oh, my.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, he was losing his hair for other reasons, and I said, is that why you're doing it, too?",
        "I mean, I was just furious, and I found it easier not to even be around a lot of people.",
        "I know, and my - actually the worst, emotionally, the worst time I had was when I lost my hair, which was very surprising to me, but I remember being in the shower and washing my hair and it all coming off, and I stood in the shower and sobbed for many minutes.",
        "So that was a very difficult time for me.",
        "I'm very thankful I'm overcoming things, and I'm healthy, still going through treatment and being healthy.",
        "And I wondered if this general sense of think positive in our culture is really rooted in another cultural belief, which is that pain and suffering and sorrow and discomfort are not supposed to be part of our lives.",
        "I think so, to an extent.",
        "I am not somebody who would like, romanticize suffering and say it's good for us, or that it strengthens our character or something.",
        "I would like to eliminate suffering as much as possible.",
        "Right.",
        "But you know, there's this - an extent of denial which we've been through so much, which - you know, in my book, I highlight how it played in to the financial crash, because nobody wanted to believe that the housing was a bubble or that subprimes were, you know, going to collapse, or any of that.",
        "And people who were negative in the workplace were fired for bringing these - their doubts up or raising questions.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, thank you for taking my call.",
        "And once again, keep up the work of saying what is unpopular."

        "Karen, calling from Evanston.",
        "Hi.",
        "I am so delighted to be able to thank Barbara for the articles that she wrote earlier in the decades that I read in 2007, when I was diagnosed and treated for breast cancer.",
        "It was such a relief for me to be able to read those articles that other patients passed on to me, and to know that I wasn't crazy for not listening to the people who told me that I needed to be cheerful when I had - even a friend who had curable cancer told me it was my responsibility to stay positive.",
        "And Gregory Rodriguez, I'm going to give you 30 seconds to answer this question...",
        "What'd the coat look like?",
        "Now, I was lucky, and my therapist knew then, that there wasn't scientific support for positive thinking in terms of getting better, surviving, living and not dying.",
        "So that was a great comfort to me.",
        "And also, I really think - and I'd love to get your perspective on this - that when we don't allow ourselves to fully feel what's going on - for me, it was sadness and anger - then I think, you know, and this may be true of our society in general, that we suppress these feelings.",
        "And could that be a cause of the epidemic of depression?",
        "It's certainly deepened my depression that year.",
        "Well, they say that yeah, depression as anger turned inwards.",
        "There maybe something to that, but I could only speculate.",
        "But thank you for telling you that what I wrote made you feel less crazy.",
        "I was very frightened when I first wrote about my experience and my response to all this cheerfulness - artificial cheerfulness.",
        "But mostly, you know, the responses have been from other women who were just silenced by it and intimidated by it.",
        "Karen, continued good luck."

        "Yeah.",

        "But as I, you know, researching for various reasons, I was interested in the corporate culture in the middle of this decade.",

        "And then to my shock, I found that people who are experiencing layoffs get the same kind of line.",
        "That they should be grateful for the layoff, it's a wonderful transition, that they need to think positively, that anything that happens to them is because of their attitude, and that's all that has to be changed and worked on.",

        "Don't ask the question about where the cancer comes from.",
        "Don't ask why so many people are not employed, even in good times in our country.",

        "And that's when I began to think hey, this kind of operates as a way of quelling discontent, quelling dissent, you know, when you can't say I'm mad about -whatever.",
        "You just have to swallow it and smile.",
        "And deal with an individual as opposed to, you know, an organizational level.",

        "Of course not.",
        "You know, it's - of course we're with people who are going through various moods and phases.",
