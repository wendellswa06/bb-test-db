        "The World Bank says closing the smuggling tunnels contributed to the 15 percent drop in Gaza's GDP last year.",
        "The closures also hurt Gaza's government budget because Hamas, the militant group that runs the Gaza Strip, actually collects import duties on goods smuggled from Egypt.",
        "Now Hamas is looking for other sources of income to combat a financial crisis, like raising taxes, says Gazan economist Omar Shaban.",
        "...Depending only or mainly on the tax collection.",
        "He says depending on tax collection is not enough, so that's why Gaza has a financial crisis.",
        "In Israel, the top Gaza tunnel worry is not commercial passages to Egypt, but underground networks that go from Gaza near or into Israel.",
        "Hamas used to launch attacks during last summer's war and is still digging them.",

        "Iran analyst Ali Vaez, with the International Crisis Group, says a complete agreement this month is unlikely.",
        "But what may be possible is enough progress to justify keeping the talks going.",
        "If the talks aren't wrapped up by the time a new Republican-led Senate is sworn in, however, opponents of a nuclear deal will have a powerful new ally to work with.",
        "And their arguments may seem persuasive.",
        "They could argue that if the parties have not been able to reach agreement after a year of comprehensive negotiations, what does another four months or six months add to the process?",

        "But if it happens in the New Year, with the GOP in charge, a veto-proof sanctions bill is a real possibility with sobering consequences for diplomacy.",
        "If a new sanctions bill is imposed, it's almost certain that Iran would respond by showing defiance, walking away from diplomacy and imposing some additional measures of their own - increasing the number of centrifuges or maybe going back up to 20 percent enriched uranium.",
        "Against that increasingly grim backdrop, these talks in Oman and the upcoming round in Vienna will face only the first near impossible task - reaching a nuclear accord.",
        "The second task may be just as tough - convincing skeptical audiences in Tehran and Washington to sign off on it.",
