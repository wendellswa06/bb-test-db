        "Although, maybe San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom is following their lead a little too closely.",
        "Newsom has been embroiled in a sex scandal recently, admitting to an affair with the wife of his campaign manager - now ex-campaign manager.",
        "He apologized for his behavior last week, and then yesterday said he would seek counseling for alcohol abuse.",
        "Joining me now to talk about the story is Charlie Goodyear.",
        "He's a political writer with the San Francisco Chronicle, and welcome to DAY TO DAY.",
        "Hello.",
        "What's happened to Gavin Newsom?",
        "Is this the end of his career, which had great promise?",
        "Well, you know, I think it's too early to say it's the end of his career, but I think the feeling is that it may seriously damage his ability to run for state or national office, at least in the near future.",
        "That's certainly the way most observers around the state and here in San Francisco are seeing it.",
        "Well, what has been the reaction there in San Francisco?",
        "Because, you know, this is a notoriously tolerant city.",
        "Well, you know, I think the public in general has been more forgiving than a lot of politicians in city hall - insiders who view this as a tremendous blunder and a real waste of opportunity.",
        "I do have to say that the stories about the mayor and his personal life have been circulating for a month, and it's only been recently that anyone's really been willing to go on the record.",
        "Well, obviously, we had last week the resignation of his campaign director that touched off this whole thing."

        "And now, he says his going into rehab.",
        "Well, actually, he says it's not rehab, but he says he's going into some kind of counseling for alcohol abuse.",
        "Right, it'll be out-patient alcohol rehab.",
        "And the mayor insists that it will not impact his day-to-day responsibilities leading the city, but, you know, many here in town - most supervisors on our city council - they'll have a lot of questions about how that's all going to work.",
        "So how is he going to also run the city?",
        "Well, that's what people want to know.",
        "And not too many people at city hall were surprised that he's, you know, admitted to a drinking problem.",
        "Most people thought that that admission was going to come last week.",
        "And a lot of people were surprised by the timing of this, which put the story back onto our front page and, you know, top local broadcasts and national news around the country today.",
        "So, are you saying that his people are kind of not handling the PR aspect of this well?",
        "I think this is a scandal that, you know, the Newsom team is trying very hard to weather, but they are being sort of buffeted by - from all sides.",
        "And, you know, I think it's been very hard to sort of keep up with what the mayor is trying to do personally to stem the damage here.",
        "And, you know, everyday is sort of a new and wild ride for all of us.",
        "Well, also, you have to wonder about rehab in general.",
        "A lot of political figures lately have been going into rehab, and it seems to be the thing to do to repair your reputation.",
        "Right, and I think that might have been one reason why the mayor just didn't want to tackle that subject when he admitted to having this affair last week.",
        "I think some people would've viewed it cynically as a way to dig himself out of this hole.",
        "That was certainly the reaction when he finally announced he is going into rehab yesterday.",
        "You know, that is a strategy for a lot of politicians who find themselves in trouble.",
        "But, you know, I have to say there have been stories in our paper and elsewhere about the mayor's excessive drinking for several months now, so I think most people certainly believe he has a problem with alcohol.",

        "But the latest today is that the Fed and Treasury are asking Congress for broader authority to seize, to take over financial institutions whose collapse they fear would threaten the financial markets and financial institutions that are not banks, because they say that one of the reasons that they couldn't intervene earlier and perhaps as aggressively as they would have liked with AIG, and maybe by doing so could have limited the losses, is that they didn't have the authority.",
        "And so they have - they're asking for it now, which of course begs the question: why do they want it?",
        "And I think for a couple of reasons.",
        "One, I think they'd like, in the near term, I think they'd like to have more management control over AIG.",
        "Taxpayers own 80 percent of it, but the government feels that they're kind of constrained in what they can actually tell management to do, as we saw with the recent bonus issue.",
        "I think this is also about hedge funds, because I do think if you ask what are the next shoes to drop, I've looked at the other major insurance companies, I think you're going to see potential losses down the road.",
        "I don't think you're going to see fatal risk to the financial markets.",
        "I think hedge funds is what they're worried about.",
        "Right now they could not take over a hedge fund in dire trouble.",
        "But with these powers they could, and maybe limit further contagion.",
        "I have a couple of questions.",
        "From your answer, I got a couple of questions.",
        "First of all, when you say not banks, can you fill in what not banks means?",
        "Well, the creative and fertile minds on Wall Street are able to create a lot of various iterations, but I think you're talking about insurance companies.",
        "You know, various state governments could maybe take over the insurance operations of a big insurance company.",
        "But again, with AIG, their problems were not in the policies that they wrote; it was all their financial engineering on the side, writing all these credit default swaps, that when they were - had to - when they had to pay them off, they couldn't.",
        "Their losses were too massive.",
        "You're talking about hedge funds, you know, and I mean I think you could use your imagination after them.",
        "And when you discuss the idea of the government being able to take control or have active involvement - or what kind of level are we talking about?",
        "Are we talking about helping to craft contracts, to break contracts, such as bonus contracts?",
        "What kind of intervention are we discussing?",
        "Everything you mentioned there.",
        "I think that one of the problems or frustrations they felt with AIG was that in the case of AIG, you had a lot of bondholders that AIG defaulted on their payments, on their promise payments to bondholders.",
        "AIG also had a lot of contracts with investors that had bought these credit default swaps, which are basically like insurance policies for bondholders.",
        "If I were to buy, you know, I'm Mr. Moneypants on Wall Street and I buy, you know, $1 million or $10 million in bonds issued by CitiCorp; or, maybe I'm a bank or a lender and I make a loan to GM, then you think, you know, how can I hedge my risk, you know, I'd like to take out an insurance policy.",
        "That's what AIG was basically selling.",
        "These were, like insurance policies, that if the bonds you bought defaulted, you buy this policy from AIG for, you know, five cents on the dollar.",
        "And if they - if your borrower defaults, then AIG will pay you off.",
        "Well, AIG didn't imagine that Lehman Brothers would fail and Bear Stearns would fail, and they had billions and trillions of dollars in credit default swaps, insurance policies, that they've written for all these guys.",
        "So back to your question, AIG had to pay off, had to honor all those swaps contracts.",
        "The government comes in and they're in the position where they have to honor them as well, but you're kind of paying off all these sophisticated investors like Goldman Sachs.",
        "That's where part of this money from AIG is going.",
        "It's going to pay off investors like Goldman Sachs that bought those swaps from AIG.",
        "And you could argue, well, Goldman Sachs is not exactly a widow or orphan, why should taxpayers be having to pay them off from these swaps?",
        "And, you know, if the government had more authority they might be able to go in to all these bondholders and say, you know what, you know, you were basically - it was like you were making a bet with us by buying this insurance policy, and we're just not going to pay - we'll pay you a fraction.",
        "You're going to have to take a haircut like everybody else, from the shareholders on."

        "I imagine if you're running a hedge fund, you probably don't like this news.",
        "If you are a free marketeer, if you work on Wall Street, or if you just - if you believe passionately about the free markets -you're going to get the willies from the idea that the government can come in and effectively declare martial law on your company and take you over.",
        "Because, you know, you and I can say in hindsight, well, AIG definitely was a failure.",

        "But if the government gets its power, it's kind of a moot point.",
        "Well, because of the suggestion that Geithner needs to go in there and do this, or has a shared responsibility with the Federal Reserve, is that the suggestion, I believe?",
        "Well, actually, the Fed Chairman, Bernanke, said he would like to see the government get the powers.",
        "He was a little agnostic on which agency should actually be the one that kind of swoops in and declares martial law.",
        "And he said, maybe the FDIC.",

        "Shouldn't someone else have been looking out ahead down the line, saying, okay, I see a very large financial institution, that's important to this country's structure, looking weak?",

        "Uh oh.",
        "Yet - well hindsight is 20/20.",
        "And again, in the case of AIG, you had a lot of state regulators who had the authority to oversee and look at their insurance books.",
        "But again, at the holding company level, you had a lot of these, you know, financial engineering games and activities going on.",
        "So this would give the government, the federal government specifically, power - kind of holistic power - over the entire companies.",
        "And, of course, hedge funds are unregulated, so that -this would be something - this would be new regulation there."
