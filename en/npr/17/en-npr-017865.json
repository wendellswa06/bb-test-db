        "They do, I think, understand the reasoning behind the plan, in that Geithner can't get a trillion dollars from Congress, so this idea of leveraging it is a good idea.",
        "They love the fact that the government is willing to indemnify them against losses.",
        "But as we just talked about, they are terrified of being, you know, a year from now, being a poster child for greed…",

        "It's something - and forgive me, I don't necessarily have a head for business - how would someone make double-digit?",
        "How would you have double-digit earnings on one of these assets you take on?",
        "Well, to try to simplify it down - but let's say the bank made a loan for a dollar.",
        "Okay.",
        "But the person who borrowed that dollar can't repay it.",
        "And we're going to have to oversimplify, but, you know, there's usually active secondary markets.",
        "Because the truth is, banks will make loans and then they'll sell some of the loans to other banks.",
        "And so there's actually like - it's almost like a secondary or stock market for, you know, loans being bought and sold among investors and everybody.",
        "So you kind of have a price for what the value of that loan is.",
        "Well, let's say the borrower is struggling to repay, people are doubtful they're going to repay, so that loan is basically - the effective market value or trade value is 30 cents on the dollar, because that's about what everyone suspects the bank will recover…",

        "So Dean, as an aforth(ph), and as we look at the - what Timothy Geithner is presenting to us in the upcoming weeks, if you want our listeners to remember one thing or to concentrate on one thing, what would that be?",
        "The one thing is that everyone is - every time he comes out with a plan or more details on the plan, everyone rants and screams about how it's an incomplete plan, there are not enough details, you know, they - he's not doing enough.",
