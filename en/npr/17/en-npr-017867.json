        "Thank you so much.",

        "I know that racism is not dead, but we were trying to just explore some of the models for race that we've held dear for many years.",
        "And so we started - the actual blog started after - a couple of days after the speech, the Philadelphia speech that Obama gave on race.",
        "And one of the things that I said from the very, very beginning, that it was so important to have people speak openly and honestly about race.",

        "People feel free to say things that they would not ordinarily say in face-to-face contact.",
