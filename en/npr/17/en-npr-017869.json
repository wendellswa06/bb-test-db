        "Hi there.",
        "Hi.",
        "I had - I agree with Mr. Rodriguez, and I had that experience of moving in and getting to know people on a personal level.",
        "I relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota, and I moved in with a white woman until I got my own place.",
        "And so we had all these intimate talks.",
        "We'd go out in the - at night, and we'd come back and we'd talk about everything.",
        "And one night, we had been out, and I noticed there was some distance.",
        "And she said to me - I asked her, what was wrong?",
        "And she said to me that until I started out with her, she would have never believed that any man would prefer me, because of my skin color, to her.",
        "And that led to a really, really in-depth discussion about race relations, where I learned so much about her family.",
        "She had two beautiful bi-racial kids, who didn't know their white side of their family.",
        "But during the time that I was there, they did come together.",
        "And I just will always value that experience and the fact that we were able to be so honest with each other, because she also hung out with a group of African-American men who only dated white women.",
        "So we were even able to talk about that, even with some of the guys.",
        "So it was a really, really good experience.",
        "I think that when you are at work and in places of - public places, there's a facade there that kind of disappears if you can go into the homes, and like Mr. Rodriguez said, go out and have a drink and take those walls down, and the communication, I think, becomes much more open.",
        "And we found out that we're more alike than different.",
        "And nevertheless, I'm sure you also learned that while maybe not a perfect person, she was a person.",
        "Right, right, who had all kinds of issues.",
        "She felt like she wasn't she wasn't attractive to white men, and at 18, she moved into a housing project where there were a lot of black people, and they loved her and thought she was very attractive.",
        "So it was it was really interesting.",
        "I will always value that time that I spent with her, and that time that I spent in Minnesota, period, because it seemed that it was a good place to openly talk about racial issues.",
        "Interesting, also, that you would mention the word facade, and Gregory Rodriguez, I think Dawn Turner Trice in her segment talked about the advantage of doing this on a blog, where people are anonymous or semi anonymous.",
        "When we're confronted with the problem of being somebody identifiable, we do mount a facade.",
        "We may not speak honestly.",
        "Right, right.",
        "But you know, when you're hanging out at the dinner table after you've been hanging out all night, you get a chance to have more intimate...",
        "Exchanges, yeah."

        "Well, the caller says exactly what I would hope to say much better than I did, which is that friendship between individuals leads to greater racial understanding.",
        "She did get around to talking to race with her friend, but it was only after they met each other as individuals.",
        "And as long as we're keeping up this and race is one of our many identities we carry around.",
        "You know, we have so many identities, and we don't again, as your first guest said, we often assume that one acts as a black person or as a Latino or as a white.",

        "And neither of us speak that way, at least not most of the time, and it's insulting when people I don't know if it's a discomfort level or because maybe they don't know better.",
        "And some people, as was said earlier, some people who are unfamiliar with other cultures, they really don't know, and they're not being they're not trying to be disrespectful, but all black people do not speak, you know, a certain kind of way, and all black young, tall, black men do not play basketball.",
        "My son has never played sports a day in his life.",

        "He's a leader of the 40,000 people, or at least the constituents within his district, but we superimpose these roles on people, and it's a way of almost disenfranchising Latinos themselves, to say that only their leaders matter.",
