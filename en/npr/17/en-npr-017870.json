        "So a self-selected group.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So you're not getting the most racist people in a community, that's for sure.",
        "And so, therefore, I guess there's an element of preaching to the choir here.",
        "Well, exactly.",
        "I mean, a lot of people criticize these dialogues for that.",
        "They say, you know, aren't you just preaching to the choir?",
        "And I asked many people running dialogue programs like this around the country how they responded to that criticism.",
        "And the best answer I got, I think the one that was most - just telling of what goes on in these groups is what was from an activist in Dayton, Ohio, and she said, you know, I said, aren't these programs just preaching to the choir?",
        "And she said, well, honey, sometimes the choir needs practice.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And that rang very true for me for what I see going on in these programs, because many times - go ahead, I'm sorry.",
        "Well, I was just going to say also, the choirs need practice, but sometimes the choirs - I'm not sure how to extend the metaphor, but there's some discordance there.",
        "People in the choirs think, hey, I'm OK, but bringing out their own racial prejudice can sometimes shock them.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, exactly.",
        "Many times what you get is - especially among the white folks who volunteer for these programs, they're people who are what you probably consider liberal with respect to racial tolerance, or pretty racially-tolerant, pretty liberal with respect to a lot of race-relations policies and civil rights policies.",
        "But they get into these dialogues and their eyes are opened very wide, and they realize that in their own daily life they actually perpetuate certain forms of discrimination.",
        "They actually perform some types of racist acts, even without knowing it, and certainly without intending to.",
        "And sometimes, I assume, this stings.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "So one thing that comes out in these dialogues is people tell each other their stories, and they both tell each other sort of their own perceptions of race relations in their community.",
        "But I think the things that are most powerful are the stories about what happened to me personally, and here's a story of when I went into a grocery store as an African-American man, and repeatedly this happens to me, that a white woman will hold her purse tighter to her, and draw her children nearer to her, just out of a base reaction of seeing me."

        "And other whites in the group will look around at each other and say, oh, my goodness, I can't believe that goes on in my community, and then sometimes whites in the group will say, well, I guess, maybe I've done that myself.",
        "And stories like that, when they get told, they're very eye-opening, and it may be that they're preaching to the choir.",
        "But again, the choir needs practice, in the sense that if these are the folks who want to improve race relations, in their community, they find out they have quite a bit more to learn before they can actually move forward together and actually try and heal race relations right there in their own town.",
        "Let's get Jackie on the line.",
        "Jackie's with us from Simsbury in Connecticut.",
        "Hi, yes.",
        "My name is Jackie.",
        "I'm actually a professor at the University of Connecticut.",
        "And I teach a course there called \"\"Human Evolution and Diversity,\"\" where we explore race from more of a biological perspective.",
        "And it's really a very science-based class, but I would like to somehow incorporate more of a discussion about race from a social perspective and that's not really my background.",
        "My background is in science and biology.",
        "But I was wondering if maybe Ms. Walsh had any tips or what types of things I can do to foster that kind of environment that's open and would encourage the discussion.",
        "Well, that's a great question, and honestly, you're in a great place in order to do that, because the first thing I would suggest is that you get in touch with an organization called Everyday Democracy, located right there in Connecticut, and many of the dialogues that I studied across the country were assisted by this organization, formerly called the Study Circles Resource Center.",
        "And one thing that the Study Circles - or Everyday Democracy folks will probably tell is to set a - just have your students agree on a set of ground rules and things like, you know, listen to each other, take turns, don't monopolize discussion times, so just very common sense kind of discussion rules.",
        "But you know they might also help you - kind of give you a curriculum which your students can use to sort of foster dialogue.",
        "It would be things like just sort of questions to ask, for the facilitators of the discussion to ask, to help guide the students through talking about race, because goodness knows, it's a very difficult topic to talk about.",
        "And there's a word there, facilitators.",
        "You need outside help, you think?",
        "I do feel like I would benefit from the outside help, because like I said, my background is not in any kind of social science.",
        "It's really biology.",
        "So I'm kind of working my way through how to - as opposed to standing up there and just teaching the students, I would like to get them involved and to get them to talk to each other and to be able to benefit from learning both sides, both biological aspect of race and our diversity and also the social aspects.",
        "But they're so different, I mean, the scientific method is one thing, but you're asking, essentially, for anecdotes, these people's stories, what happened to you?",
        "It's I don't know, Kathy Cramer Walsh, it will be a very different kind of a class that day."

        "And good for you for wanting to give it a go.",
        "I would say outside help might be - might be great in the sense - if you have folks who are practiced in leading discussions about race, and quite honestly, there are - you'd be surprised how many people in the community have been involved in some kind of dialogue about race.",
        "If you just maybe look around, ask the Everyday Democracy folks for some help, they can maybe help you locate folks.",
        "But having someone come in who's skilled at leading a discussion on race could really help a lot.",

        "Mm hm.",
        "You know, honestly, I'm not quite sure how to respond to that because one - one of my reactions is if you're saying people are never honest in these discussions, you know, I can't say whether they're honest or not.",
        "How can we, you know - we can't read people's minds at this point in time.",
        "So does that mean that people are never honest with one another about how resentful they are, or how hurt they are?",
        "Perhaps that's the case, but I think these discussions do work, but they don't work in the way you expect.",
        "I mean, they - it's not the case that people go into these discussions very resentful of one another and then come out holding hands and best friends with each other for life.",
        "That's not what happens.",
        "Instead what happens is people go into these discussions thinking that they're going to be best friends for life in some cases, and they think that what's going to happen is that they're going to see people as people and they're going to move beyond race.",
        "And I say that as an expectation across people across racial backgrounds."

        "But instead what happens is they hear stories about discrimination, and they hear stories that illuminate the very different perspectives that people of different racial backgrounds have in this country and they're surprised.",

        "They would never know that these differences in perspectives and histories and experiences exist.",
        "So, yeah, it's possible that people are never completely honest, whatever that means, in these discussions.",

        "I think a lot of people are very guarded when it comes to talking about race.",
        "And it's only when you have the opportunity or the forum to open up that kind of opening up is going to occur.",

        "Sure, yeah.",
        "Or what not, and you'd've just let it go by or you might bring it up later, but it's really not that big a deal with your close friends.",
