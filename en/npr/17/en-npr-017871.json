        "I want a woman, period, not just a black woman.",
        "So by her saying that I think it was an insult to being black and I'm black.",

        "That I think there's a difference between, say, a debate or discussion about, say, policy change or the type of action people want to take together.",
        "There's a difference between that and dialogue, and I think that dialogue actually is necessary in order to reveal the misunderstandings that people have.",

        "With the preacher situation, with New Orleans, we have to deal with race in an honest way.",
        "And the only way we're going to do that is if I come out of my little white-male shell, and again, I'm a white male so I feel this, and really try to understand where all this is coming from.",
        "And I agree with that.",
        "I think oftentimes that it's only in these discussion forums that that kind of awareness comes into play.",
        "For example, I can remember a discussion among a group of folks.",
        "It was primarily African-Americans from community and white, male members of the local city government.",

        "And could you finish this in 10 seconds?",
        "Sure.",
        "And the white, male members of the government, their eyes were opened very wide by the stories that they heard.",
