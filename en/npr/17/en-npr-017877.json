        "But I think that Romney, long before we ever got to last week and yesterday, had set in motion a great campaign organization here in Michigan.",
        "He had piled up a list of endorsements, drawing on his father's years as governor back in the '60s.",

        "Watching Mitt Romney campaign as an optimist on the economy and somebody who can make things happen as he did with the Olympics, do you get a sense that that's more - a more effective way of Romney campaigning than opposed to trying to outflank everybody on the right as he did in Iowa and New Hampshire?",
        "Well, it certainly was far more effective here in Michigan.",
        "The real question is, is it going to be effective if he uses that theme in other states - whatever state he goes to and competes hard in.",
        "He made it sound almost - if you listen to the falling stock prices on Wall Street and the potentially looming recession, as though - and he used this metaphor, Michigan is the canary in the mineshaft, and that things are bad in Michigan.",
        "And that means things may be getting really bad nationally, and I'm here to maybe tell you I can turn things around.",
        "I'm a businessman who's had success in the private sector turning things around.",

        "Michigan has simply never emerged from the last recession we had back in 2000, we've been in the doldrums ever since.",
        "But - in other words, Romney has got to kind of repackage, I think, his economic message for these other states.",
        "I think the reason that he went to the right so far on socio-cultural issues, in Iowa particularly, was simply because they have - 60 percent of their electorate in Iowa were evangelicals.",
        "He had to appeal on that basis.",
        "I think he's gotten that out of the way and I think he'll try to continue on the theme of the economy if he can do it.",
        "But he's going to have to fine tune it state by state.",
