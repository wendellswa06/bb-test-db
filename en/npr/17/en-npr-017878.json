        "So are you feeling enormous relief?",

        "So I'm dealing with that.",
        "I had my state of the state.",
        "So I had very little time to decompress, as they say.",

        "I'm planning some international trips, possibly some hostage issues.",
        "And then, I'm also riding my horse.",
        "So I'm trying to rest a little bit but it's hard when your legislature - it's a 30-day citizen's legislature session.",
        "And have you had a chance to reflect on what you've learned in the past few months running for president?",
        "Well, yes I have.",
        "And I really feel that it was an extraordinary experience.",
        "I really feel the voters in this country, more than anything, want somebody to bring the country together.",
        "And they feel their process is broken.",
        "The congressional relationship with the president, dysfunctional.",
        "And what I've learned is that we're basically a good country.",
        "A lot of good people are willing to sacrifice.",
        "They're willing to come together.",
        "They're willing if they're shown the common good solution on health care and energy efficiency, on ending the war.",
        "You know, one of the pleasant experiences I had last night, I watched part of the Democratic debate that seems the three candidates have all adopted my position of getting all the troops out within a year.",
        "I - you know, if there's one contribution maybe I left in this race, it's that very aggressive policy of having all our troops out, no residual forces within a year but with a diplomatic plan.",
        "That was what I ran on and I'm glad to see all the candidates running my way.",
        "You said you heard a lot of talk about people really wanted to bring things together.",
        "But I also see a lot of Democrats who are really angry - angry going back to an election they thought was stolen in 2000, angry about the way the war has been handled and represented, angry about wire taps and a lot of other thing, and they want a candidate who's confrontational, too.",
        "I'm not sure that's the case.",
        "Everybody's angry.",
        "I'm angry.",
        "But it's how you get things done.",
        "And I believe that you need to be - you need to build new coalitions.",
        "We need to have public financing to get the special interest out.",
        "We need to have coalitions among citizens.",
        "We need to engage to the states more.",

        "And so I'm not one of those that advocates being angry to get things done.",

        "You've worked at the United Nations.",
        "You worked to, you know, supervise the nation's nuclear power plants and projects, and a lot of things -you mentioned your experience negotiating some hostage releases and that sort of thing.",
        "You had some of the funniest, cleverest commercials in Iowa where you presented that resume and were rejected as overqualified.",
        "As you look back, you know, what else might you have done?",
        "Well, I raised, for instance, a respectable amount of money -$22 million, 23 million.",

        "What would I've done differently - I'm not sure.",
        "I think I would have done everything I did.",
        "I was hoping to last a little longer into the western primaries, into Nevada and my own state on February 5th with some of the Hispanic primaries where I knew I was strong.",
        "But I simply felt that I'd run out of money, in the first place, and I didn't want to go in debt.",
        "I didn't do as well as I wanted to in Iowa and New Hampshire.",
        "You know, you can't avoid Iowa and New Hampshire and so we put a lot of resources there.",

        "I've been around even though I'm a governor in the state.",
        "And I think the voters were looking for inspirational, positive, bring the country together, and I was a little bit not a Washington insider but my - you're right, my experience, you can't escape what you've done before.",
        "And so maybe my message was I should have been more attuned to the change issue rather than just too much on experience.",

        "And since the presidency is not really an option at this point, I'm wondering if the governor has given any thought to perhaps accepting a position of a vice president if that was offered to him?",

        "Well, first, we didn't have the resources of the other candidates.",
        "That's number one, financial resources.",
        "And, you know, it's not that we were outspent.",
        "We were hugely outspent.",
        "I was outspent 10 to one by Clinton and Obama.",
        "And it's very hard to compete in that regard.",
        "Secondly, you know, as I said earlier, we represented experience and we've all - the three of us have been tested.",
        "But I believe we didn't represent change as much as Senator Obama and some of the other candidates did.",
        "And so the public, I think, was thirsting for change, and I try to combine both in my campaign change and experience.",
        "But somehow, that didn't resonate as much as I thought it would.",
        "So those were the reasons.",
        "I think Senators Biden and Dodd are enormously qualified but perhaps they were hampered by the fact that they've been in Washington all these years.",
        "And I've been in Washington but I'm a governor of a state, and I thought I had escaped that Washington syndrome.",
        "But apparently, I was viewed by some us having strong the experience cache, but somehow the inspiration for change that they were looking and went elsewhere.",
