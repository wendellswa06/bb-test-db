        "I do think that being president is the chief executive officer.",

        "And that, in a capsule, seems to be a lot of what they've been arguing about - one person with the vision, the other person saying, look, you need somebody to translate that vision into actual - running the government.",
        "It is the chief executive office.",
        "And, you know, that's actually what was behind the argument about race to begin with.",
        "Because, at one point, Hillary Clinton said, shortly after the New Hampshire Primary, that for all that Martin Luther King did on behalf of civil rights, you needed a Washington establishment like President Johnson to make it happen.",
        "So that - unfortunately, escalated into an argument about race.",
        "But I think that's the two ways the two candidates sees the office.",

        "One, the issue of race.",
        "I think it probably will benefit Barack in a short term.",
        "But I'm concerned that in the long term, if he becomes the nominee, maybe that's going to turn off some white voters.",
        "Secondly, just concerned about President Clinton with him being out there and be the attack dog.",
        "I really like to see my ex-presidents like - be a statesperson person.",
        "And I understand that, you know, he's obviously defending his wife.",
        "But doesn't that diminish the presidency - you know, the state of being an ex-president?"

        "Yeah.",

        "Indeed, some of President Clinton's remarks, Ken, were seen as unseemly.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, obviously, the purpose of a running mate is to be the attack dog.",
        "And you wonder if Hillary Clinton will need a running mate given the fact that Bill Clinton has been so harsh on Barack Obama.",
        "But earlier, the point you're making is very valid, that in the short term, this could be very well help Barack Obama - certainly in the January 26th South Carolina primary, where more than 50 percent of the electorate is African-American.",
        "But ultimately, he doesn't want to run as a black candidate.",
        "He wants to run as somebody who could unite the country - certainly unite blacks and whites.",
        "And I think focusing on race in the long run would certainly hurt the Obama effort.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Paul.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And, Ken, we've talked a little bit about South Carolina coming up on the Republican side.",
        "The Democratic South Carolina primary is afterwards.",
        "So we'll get to that in the later broadcast.",
        "But looking ahead now to Nevada, the caucuses in Nevada - and still a lawsuit as to whether casinos are in the appropriate place to have a Democratic caucus.",
        "Right.",
        "And, again, you know, Hillary Clinton was very armed with that in yesterday's - last night's debate.",
        "She spoke a lot about Nevada issues.",
        "You know, if you think the arguments about race were kind of yucky, well, yacka(ph) was the issue yesterday by Hillary Clinton - sorry, Neal."

        "And then you go to South Carolina, which will be the - that - since there's no Democratic contest in Florida, they're not competing there, it'll be South Carolina and then into Super Tuesday where Obama, Edwards and Hillary are going to fight it out.",
        "And finally, in non-campaign news, Representative John Doolittle, Republic of California, the subject of a federal investigation over his ties to Jack Abramoff, announced this week, he will not seek reelection when his term is up at the end of the session.",

        "And I think Republicans both in Washington and back in California are breathing a sigh of relief that he's not going to run again.",
        "And as you look at the fallout from this scandal at this point, how many representatives has it caused, and are there any more still waiting for the other shoe to drop?",
        "Well, certainly, it probably caused the Republicans the majority in the House in 2006.",
        "You know, there's Bob Ney, they were - Tom DeLay.",
        "There are other folks in - there was Mark Foley - although, that was not a Jack Abramoff-related scandal, but it was the culture of corruption that Nancy Pelosi liked to talk about so much.",

        "So obviously, it hurts the Republican Party.",
        "There are still some residue effects like as you see with Doolittle.",
        "But ultimately, the Republican Party, if they're going to make a comeback, really want to turn the issue back over on the Democratic side."
