        "...The investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails.",
        "...That was given by the attorney general and the deputy attorney general - why not fire him in the first few days of the administration?",
        "So the inevitable question that that leads us to is, what does this have to do with the Russia investigation?",
        "But strictly speaking - just to give the president's side of this, or the attorney general - deputy attorney general's side of this - he's the guy who wrote a letter here - they're saying, you were - you kept making these public statements about Hillary Clinton's emails.",
        "You departed from normal bureau practices, and you haven't admitted any kind of error.",
        "That's the reason, right?",
        "Correct.",
        "And that is the official reason.",
        "That is a reason that was on display last week when Jim Comey was testifying before two committees on the Hill.",
        "There was a little wrinkle in that, where Comey made a mistake in some of his testimony.",
        "And the Justice Department has been trying to figure out how they walk that back and correct the record.",
        "But given all the water under the bridge so far, it is hard to imagine that that is what has led us to this moment.",
        "Domenico, has the president always objected to James Comey's handling of Hillary Clinton's emails?",
        "No, he hasn't.",
        "He said - back in October, he told supporters it took guts for Director Comey to make the move he made in light of opposition to trying to get a criminal prosecution for Hillary Clinton.",
        "He said he's got to hang tough.",
        "That's certainly different than firing him.",
        "You know, this letter from the deputy attorney general is dated yesterday.",
        "But Steve, I have to tell you, you asked about timing and reasoning.",
        "I would call this suspicious timing and convenient reasoning at best.",
        "And also there's the fact that while the deputy attorney general says it was about Hillary Clinton's emails, an investigation going back many months, Kellyanne Conway, presidential adviser, seemed to say something quite different yesterday on CNN.",
        "Let's listen to a bit.",

        "Well, he was of course running the Russia investigation into - until last night.",
        "And this will raise questions as to whether President Trump is seeking to influence that investigation in some way.",
        "It's just amazing how abrupt this was.",
        "Isn't it?",
        "I mean, Comey was - found out about his firing while he was talking to FBI employees in Los Angeles.",
        "The news broke on a TV.",
        "He started laughing because he thought it was a prank.",
        "I mean, Congress set up this job, a 10-year term, hoping it would be independent.",
        "Comey was just in Year 3.",

        "Either way, this is not a day that Congress envisioned or wanted to see.",
        "OK.",
        "Let's remember the backstory to all of this, which, by the way, does include the story of Hillary Clinton's emails.",
        "Yeah, it sure does.",
        "I mean, this all started back in July of last year.",
        "Then-candidate Donald Trump was critical of the FBI director after he announced that he would not recommend charges against Hillary Clinton for using that private email server.",
        "But then Comey stunned a lot of people when he announced that he was reopening the investigation, and that was just 11 days before voters went to the polls in this extraordinary election.",
        "This is where things started to turn around.",
        "Here's what Trump had to say right after the FBI director's announcement.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "And I have to give the FBI credit.",
        "That was so bad what happened originally.",
        "And it took guts for Director Comey to make the move that he made in light of the kind of opposition he had, where they're trying to protect her from criminal prosecution.",
        "You know that."

        "The FBI director serves at the president's pleasure, so he could have replaced him at any time.",
        "I mean, I think if you had to pick a moment in what has clearly been a difficult relationship between Trump and his FBI director, I would point you back to one day, March 20.",
        "This is when Jim Comey appeared on Capitol Hill.",
        "He was testifying before the House intelligence committee, and he was asked about the president's tweets, President Trump's tweets, saying that he'd been wiretapped and accusing the Obama administration and President Obama personally of ordering those wiretaps.",
        "So he was asked about it.",
        "Here he is testifying.",

        "Right.",
