        "before he left office, and that makes today a time to reflect on his legacy and how he is still trying to change it.",
        "Here's NPR's Michele Kelemen.",
        "When you think about President Bush's approach to the world, multilateralism is probably not one of the words that comes to mind, but President Bush is trying, again, to shed his go-it-alone image.",
        "And a top State Department official, Assistant Secretary Brian Hook, says the president does have a record of working with the U.N.",
        "Whether it's on humanitarian response, nonproliferation, threats to peace and security, preventing AIDS, getting relief to people on AIDS and malaria, across the board you've actually seen extensive multilateral cooperation.",
        "And the president doesn't get as much credit as he deserves.",
        "For the most part, President Bush is seen as a leader who initially worked around the United Nations to wage the war in Iraq.",
        "In his second term, he turned more often to the U.N.",
        "Robert Orr a top adviser to U.N.",

        "And that more realistic approach to the U.N.",
        "certainly showed up after all of the breakdown around Iraq had kind of played out, and people began to look towards the institution to solve real problems, whether it was on the human rights or development side, but also on the security side.",
