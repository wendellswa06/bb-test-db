        "That was Charles Fasano.",
        "Nobody else at the table agreed with his statement about an Obama presidency, including Susan Campbell.",

        "And so, when I had the opportunity and was prepared to take the risk, that's what I decided to focus on.",
        "These secretions are everywhere you look; pancreas cells secrete the hormone insulin to help you digest, and nerve cells in the brain secrete chemicals called neurotransmitters to talk to one another.",
        "One of the less heralded but absolutely critical secretory products are the endorphins, which cause a good mood.",
        "Now, everybody has commented on how my mood has been very good today.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "At a Yale University news conference celebrating his Nobel Prize this afternoon, Rothman credited his great mood to the endorphins his cells are secreting, along with dopamine, which is secreted in the brain's reward circuitry.",
        "His point, of course, is that our bodies rely on all these secretions.",
        "When something goes awry, diseases can often result, as varied as autism, Alzheimer's and even our body's toxic reaction to botulism.",
        "Rothman says he's very grateful he started this work in the early 1970s, back when the federal government was willing to take much bigger risks in handing out funding to young scientists."

        "And it's actually becoming a pressing national issue, if not an international issue.",

        "The world's supply of vaccine for hepatitis B is actually made in yeast.",
        "And then they harnessed yeast cells to manufacture and secrete insulin, which is now one-third of the world supply of human insulin is made by secretion in yeast.",
        "Schekman and Rothman, working independently, gradually started to realize that their two stories were coming together.",
        "The genes in yeast were very much like the same genes in animals, so it was two complementary ways of uncovering the same basic story.",
