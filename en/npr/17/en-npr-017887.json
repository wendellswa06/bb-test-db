        "Well, You know, I thought that was kind of a peculiar analysis.",

        "Look, we've run a tremendous campaign with the help not of big donors, or not of lobbyists who have given big checks, but millions and millions of people that have gotten involved and donated their time and their money online.",

        "Well, look, I think Senator McCain's houses will likely come up because what it demonstrates is that Senator McCain is simply out of touch with working Americans.",
        "For somebody to have seven or eight houses and not remember how many they had, or to stand up in front of a group in a church and tell them that five million dollars is when you finally get - making five million dollars is when you're finally rich, demonstrates not somebody who doesn't care, but somebody who's simply out of touch with what's going in real people's lives.",
