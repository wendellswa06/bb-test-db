        "He's a native of the Dominican Republic, where he watched musical styles come and go.",
        "He's over 80 now, and he has outlived all the members of his original music group.",
        "Now, he has released his first solo album in the U.S.",
        "It's called \"\"Mujer De Cabaret.\"\" Banning Eyre has a review.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "The sound that established the career of Jose Cobles lies buried beneath layers of musical and political history.",
        "His stage name, Puerto Plata, refers to the resort town where he was born.",
        "But Cobles made his mark in La Joya, a storied red-light district of the Dominican capital, Santiago.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "(Singing in foreign language)",
        "This style is called son, Puerto Plata's signature back in the late '40s when he got his start.",
        "Son is usually associated with Cuba, but you find it all through the Spanish-speaking Caribbean.",
        "Dominican son got overshadowed because that country's notorious dictator, Rafael Trujillo, preferred merengue, effectively making it the national music.",
        "No surprise then, Puerto Plata also cranks out a mean merengue.",

        "The two lead guitarists provide the real fireworks.",
        "So far, we've been hearing 62-year-old Edilio Paredes.",

        "(Soundbite of song \"\"Los Piratas\"\")",
        "On this song, \"\"Los Piratas,\"\" Puerto Plata condemns the 9/11 attacks.",
        "Merengue tradition has always called for commentary on contemporary events, even from singers whose mission is to revive the sound and spirit of the past.",
        "Mujer de Cabaret\"\" is Afro-Latin revival music at its best - passionate, brisk, and, coming from an all-but-forgotten octogenarian, delightfully unexpected.",

        "Every spring, before the ice begins to fracture, there's a brief window for voyagers trying to reach it.",
        "Now, that window is shrinking due to a warming climate."

        "Last October, Moore was diagnosed with chronic kidney failure, a result, doctors think, of an antibody reaction to a childhood illness.",
        "Moore went to a dialysis center for a couple of months, but he didn't like sitting still for three hours a day, three days a week.",
        "So when doctors suggested dialysis at home at night while he slept, Moore jumped at the chance."
