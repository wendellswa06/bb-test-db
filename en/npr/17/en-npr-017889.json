        "They've tried this, as you said, in the past, but there's always been a problem in determining whether the person who was representing himself as someone close to Mullah Omar, someone with influence in the Taliban really was someone of influence.",
        "You know, there was a case last fall where you had NATO flying a senior - so-called senior Taliban representative into Kabul for talks, only to find out that the guy was a fake, that he didn't represent anyone but himself.",

        "You know, President Obama, as you said, is going to announce the early withdrawal of troops starting in July and they really would like to also announce that they've made some progress with what they've always said has got to be a negotiated settlement to this war.",
        "In the end, when you look at the Taliban's demands - the release of prisoners, the total pullout of all foreign troops from Afghanistan - you know, you look at that list and you wonder, where is the possibility of some kind of middle ground?",
        "So, I think that as we get further along the line, assuming we do in these talks, that the Afghan people are going to have weigh in and say what they want.",
        "And as the U.S.",
        "engages in these direct talks with the Taliban, what role, if any, do other governments play in these talks?",
        "Afghanistan, Pakistan - are these countries happy about this and happy about the possibility of sitting on the sidelines while the U.S.",
        "engages in some sort of unilateral discussion with Taliban leaders?",
        "And according to U.S.",

        "And as far as it being a crash, that has not officially been stated yet.",
        "There's been plenty of conflicting information about the behavior of the flight after it took off and shortly before it disappeared.",
        "There was initially a report that a emergency signal had been sent once the airplane had disappeared from the radar about two hours - and shortly - a little less than two hours after it disappeared, indicating, perhaps, that the airplane's emergency functions had begun to activate and that Egypt's military, which is leading the search and rescue operation, had received this signal from the aircraft, perhaps, wreckage.",
        "That was, of course, denied a few minutes later by the Egyptian military, saying they had had zero indication that there is a debris field or wreckage and that the search is still underway.",
        "OK.",

        "It was to arrive at 3 a.m. this morning.",
        "It was at cruising altitude of 37,000 feet and had just entered Egyptian airspace when it lost radar contact.",
        "So it hadn't started descending yet.",
        "But it was nearing the end of the fight.",
        "It disappeared somewhere over the Mediterranean Sea.",
        "There were 15 French passengers on board, 30 Egyptian and various other nationalities."

        "Well, the Egyptian government would take over the lead in trying to investigate what happened here.",
        "So that would be sort of first-up call.",
        "And as we've said, this is a - we have no confirmation of a crash.",
        "All we have confirmation of is that they lost the signal of the aircraft.",
        "And, you know, typically when aircraft disappeared, it doesn't often take long to find the debris field.",
        "Where it gets complicated, though, is when, you know, it crashes over water, it can disappear much, much faster.",
        "And so that's sort of the point of where investigators are at this point.",

        "Is it too soon to say whether there are any patterns emerging here?",
        "Hard to say anything about patterns other than the government response to these incidents, which, initially, especially with the Russian air disaster, was criticized internationally as being not transparent and in a bit of denial by the Egyptian government.",
        "You'll recall that the Egyptian government refused to at least acknowledge the role of terrorism in it for months.",
        "In fact, the official investigation into that incident has not yet identified a cause for that crash.",
