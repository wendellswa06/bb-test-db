        "So, as NPR's Mike Shuster reports from Tehran, Iran's reformers see an opportunity.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "Islamshahr is a small city on the southern outskirts of Tehran.",
        "On Wednesday, it was the site of one of the few full-fledged political rallies to take place before tomorrow's parliamentary election.",
        "The street outside the tiny Ali Ibn Musa Reza Mosque was clod with people, old men in dusty grey suits, women wearing head scarves or black chadors, teenagers with spiky hair and children waiving little flags.",
        "The big draw was former President Mohammad Khatami, the leading reformist who preceded Iran's current President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.",
        "(Speaking in foreign language)",
        "Nowadays, reformers don't have a loud voice, Khatami told the crowd, the conservatives try to destroy our reputation.",
        "But he said, people must be permitted to criticize the ruling system and change it if it doesn't respond to their demands.",
        "One of the charges conservatives level against the reformists is that they don't support the system of Islamic government now nearly 30 years old.",
        "So organizers of the rally in Islamshahr were careful to include all the right symbols, including an opening recitation from the Quran.",
        "(Soundbite of opening recitation of the Quran)",
        "Kathleen, does that ring true to what you experienced?",
        "A British artist has designed a pair of shoes inspired by Dorothy's ruby slippers in \"\"The Wizard Of Oz\"\" that really will help you find your way home.",

        "(As Dorothy) Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.",
        "The shoes can navigate you home, of course, and I've called them No Place Like Home.",
        "That's the wizard behind the No Place Like Home shoes, Dominic Wilcox.",
        "The secret to his magic is a GPS device built into the heel.",
        "They look like a pair of men's dress shoes: grey with red trim.",
        "On top of the left shoe are several LED lights arranged in a circle that point in the direction you should walk.",
        "And on top of the right toe is a row of lights that tells you how much farther you have to go.",
        "So instead of following the yellow brick road, you follow a blinking red light.",
        "I think electronics are the closest thing we have to real magic in some way.",
        "You know, you can do things, and if the electronics are hidden, particularly, there's some feeling of surprise and magic comes about by using things like that in inventive ways.",
        "There are currently no plans to mass produce the No Place Like Home shoes.",
        "In fact, as of now only one pair exists, making them far more rare than Dorothy's original ruby slippers.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF SONG)",
        "(Singing) Some day I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me, where troubles melt like lemon drops, away above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me."

        "The Interior Department cites what it calls new evidence that deep-water blowout preventers are not as fail-safe as they were thought to be.",
        "It also suggests the industry would be hard-pressed to cope with another spill, since cleanup crews are already stretched thin responding to BP's.",
        "White House spokesman Robert Gibbs says, given those concerns, it makes sense to hold off drilling for now.",
        "We know that that is now without some economic consequences to the region.",
        "But it's imperative that we have a sense of what happened before we continue to do this again.",
        "The administration says it's open to lifting the moratorium before November 30th, but only if the industry shows it can drill safely.",
        "Scott Horsley, NPR News, the White House."

        "What's happened across the industrialized world is that governments are feeling poor these days, and so they're a lot less willing to put money into programs like loan guarantees and production tax credits and feed-in tariffs, and other policies that historically have been the big drivers of very low-emission technologies like nuclear and wind.",
        "Wind subsidies are on the chopping block here in the United States.",

        "Michael Grubb, at Cambridge University, says those subsidies proved to be too successful.",
        "People scrambled to put solar cells on their roofs a lot faster than the government had anticipated, which meant the volume of subsidy that was going to be required for a much bigger volume of demand was going to get more expensive and they scaled back those programs."
