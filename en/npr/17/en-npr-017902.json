        "As a result, the two main slates of reformists have not been able to nominate enough candidates to run for all the seats in the 290-seat parliament.",

        "Iranians understand that what can be achieved in elections like this is limited.",
        "But at the rally the other day in Islamshahr, there were still those who expressed the hope that participation in elections, however imperfect, can bring change to Iran.",

        "It doesn't have any weights at the bottom.",
        "So why does the curtain creep inward when you take a shower?",
        "To find out, I've got Liz Marshall on the line.",
        "She's an engineer with Fluent, Inc. The company has developed software to simulate water flow, and it's been used to model the shower curtain phenomenon.",
        "Hi, Liz.",
        "Hi, Joe.",
        "And hang on a second because to save water I'm just going to shut off the shower here.",
        "So you know, there have been several attempts to explain this shower curtain business.",
        "I gather one involves hot water?",
        "Yes, that was a popular belief a while ago.",
        "People recognized that the hot shower water heated the air inside the shower curtain, and hot air rises.",
        "And so the air inside, it's less dense than the air outside the shower curtain.",
        "It would rise and pull in the cooler air from outside the shower.",
        "But then people also noticed that the shower curtain was pulled in, even in a cold shower situation.",
        "And then the other one I've read somewhere is there's - some people say the Bernoulli Effect.",
        "What's that about?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, the Bernoulli Effect says that as the fluid accelerates, as it goes faster, the pressure drops.",
        "So the idea behind the Bernoulli Effect in the shower is that as the water droplets come down from the showerhead, they drag the air along with it and that causes the air inside the shower to move.",
        "And therefore the pressure inside the shower reduces, and there's a pressure difference between that moving water - or the moving air, I should say, inside the shower curtain, and the still air outside the shower curtain that causes the shower curtain to be sucked in.",
        "So the Bernoulli Effect is one possibility, but there are other theories out there, right?"

        "Yes.",
        "In fact, David Schmidt, who's a professor at the University of Massachusetts, did a simulation about five years ago on the computer where he modeled the air flow in the shower that's generated by the spray coming down.",
        "And what he found was that the motion of the air inside the shower is actually in the form of a spinning vortex.",
        "And the spinning vortex is very much like the eye of a hurricane with a very, very low pressure at the center of it.",
        "And so it was really that low pressure that he found, which was lower than the pressure anywhere else inside the shower, that was probably the dominant mechanism to cause the shower curtain to be sucked in.",
        "So it's the low pressure at the center of the vortex that's drawing the shower curtain toward the back wall of the shower.",
        "That's right.",
        "And the shower curtain is attached at the rod, so it can't be sucked in there.",
        "The only place it's really free to move is down at the bottom, where it's not attached to anything.",
        "Initially, it was a relatively straightforward proposition that the United States should give military assistance to the opposition, to Assad, the free Syrian army.",
        "And that was something the president resisted.",
        "And the last throw of the president's dice came this year when he was offered by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, the option to cooperate against Islamic State.",
        "And the president essentially said no to that.",
        "I think it's fair to say that the president has divert (ph) - I put it this way - that he was playing solitaire while everybody else was playing chess.",
        "And unfortunately it's now much, much more difficult to intervene effectively than it was at the outset of the Syrian Civil War.",
        "Professor Ferguson, what about those Americans - and I daresay - according to polls, they number into quite a large amount who feel, if I might boil it down this way, the United States doesn't need a strategy because it has no business doing anything?",
        "That this is a tragic human situation, but it does not involve the national security interest of the United States.",
        "The reality is that allowing Islamic State to become an authentic state is very dangerous indeed for the United States because this is an organization more dangerous than al-Qaida and has the potential, unlike al-Qaida, to become a really major political force if we allow Islamic State to become more state-like.",
        "I think ultimately the United States will regret bitterly not having acted sooner to stop it.",
        "Does Vladimir Putin, whatever else might be said of him, have a sharper strategic vision than President Obama?",
        "Putin is essentially aiming, I think, to present the United States with a stark choice - ISIS or Assad.",
        "That's why I think Putin is directing his fire now at the non-ISIS opponents of the Assad regime, the people we at least thought we were going to help.",
        "And I think that's clever because we are in the position of wanting neither Assad nor ISIS.",
        "I don't think that's in fact an option.",
        "I think we are going to have to decide, and I think we have to prioritize the destruction of ISIS.",
