        "The - as you said, this farm was bought and paid off under an initial set of laws.",
        "The government then changed those laws, changed the constitution to make this kind of redistribution, as they would call it, of land legal.",

        "Yes.",
        "Essentially, Mike was saying his case to Mugabe on grounds of racial discrimination and human rights abuses.",
        "It was both of those things.",
        "And as the case grinds its way through the courts, there is a parallel operation going on in Zimbabwe.",

        "In Zimbabwe, meanwhile, the pressure is mounting on Mike and his family because of the - from the militias who continually invade.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "And when we started the film, that wasn't the start of the intimidation.",

        "I think the violence tends to spike around election times anyhow.",
        "And as they say, when we started making this film, we weren't aware that there was going to be a general election in Zimbabwe in 2008.",
        "So it worked well for us as filmmakers.",
        "As we say, we got the two play - the stories playing out.",
        "You got very intimate court case playing out in Namibia with Mike versus everything that's going on at the wider political situation in Zimbabwe.",
        "Interestingly, there's a new election next year.",
        "It's penciled for 2012 in Zimbabwe.",
        "And according to our colleagues in Zimbabwe, you're starting to get a re-escalation of the violence that you saw in 2008.",
        "And, at one point, we see Mike giving succor to the members of the opposition, the MDC, the Movement for Democratic Change, as they've been victims of violence too and makes it - cleans them up, gives them some food and some gasoline to get where they're going,"
