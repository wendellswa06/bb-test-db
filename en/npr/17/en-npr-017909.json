        "As those votes were counted, the woman responsible for certifying the election results was Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris, who joins us now.",

        "Do you have any advice for the officials who are going through something today that is not all that different from what you went through 18 years ago?",
        "Well, humbly, I could offer the only advice that I know to be true that would be helpful, and that is, regardless of the consequence, follow the letter of the law.",
        "It's not the law as they wish it would be.",
        "When I was secretary of state, I disagreed with many of the provisions in the Florida law.",
        "And previously I'd been in the Florida Senate and tried to sponsor election reform.",
        "But there was not the political will to make that happen.",
        "After election 2000, I was mocked by the media saying, oh, you'll never get it passed.",
        "But we passed the strongest election reform, and it became the model for the nation.",
        "So many of the lessons learned...",
        "So why does this keep happening in Florida?",
        "Well, guess what.",
        "It's going to happen.",
        "We have excellent election laws, but we have a very closely divided electorate.",
        "I say that we're not a red state or a blue state.",
        "We're a purple state.",
        "Consequently, we are always going to have close races.",
        "Although this does seem to go beyond a close race.",
        "You have one county where ballots can only be counted for one race at a time, another where the Senate race came after the Creole language instructions.",
        "It seems like Florida keeps running into problems that go beyond its a 50-50 state.",
        "Actually, those issues come back to the fact that the supervisors of elections are constitutionally elected officers in each county.",
        "Consequently, that's why you had Theresa LePore's issue with the butterfly ballots and now the issue in Broward County with the ballot."

        "Yeah, absolutely.",

        "ambassador to the EU.",
        "So I mean, one of the questions is - as he goes before lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who I'm sure are going to be asking some very tough questions, is how far his loyalty to President Trump will go in terms of potentially defending the president or not.",
        "I mean, based on what you have learned from him over the years, how would you expect him to handle this situation?",
        "I think it's hard to tell.",

        "Neera Tanden of the Democratic think tank Center for American Progress thinks that position is risky.",
