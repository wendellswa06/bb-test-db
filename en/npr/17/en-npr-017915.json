        "Yeah.",
        "Was the target of the bombs - are they trying to take down the planes or were they more aiming to bomb the Jewish synagogues?",
        "And then also, it sounds like they must have people that are already here that are picking out the targets and that's how they got those addresses.",
        "I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "Yeah.",
        "As I understand, you can track UPS packages that will tell you online where they go, and if they were into some sort of software in UPS, which is possible, even in Yemen, you could figure out when those packages were transferred to an airliner, if that was ultimately your target.",
        "Now, if it was the Jewish synagogues in Chicago, I don't think the administration quite knows.",
        "They're still analyzing the data, you know.",
        "And then, once the package got to where it was going, you would be able to know that and you would detonate it with a cell phone.",
        "And do we know whether the intention was to do that on the plane or at the synagogues?",
        "I think the fact that it was addressed to a synagogue - and this is just my personal assessment.",
        "I could be very wrong.",
        "It was the target was the synagogue.",
        "Otherwise, why put an obvious target like that on the address line which would attract attention?",
        "Now, terrorists are not brilliant you know, they do make mistakes.",
        "It's the technology, again, that scares me, not this particular group.",
        "All right.",

        "There is some suggestion that the British intelligence service has been very active in Yemen.",
        "Do we have an ally there working along with us on this or what can you tell us about that?",
        "Well, the Yemeni - I mean, Yemen is a very complicated country.",
        "And Britain has spent more time there.",
        "They were there until the early '60s when the civil war started, and they were forced out of the country.",
        "The British have very good Arabists.",
        "They understand the tribes.",
        "No doubt the White House is deferring to Britain's opinion on this, the foreign offices' opinion on what to do about Yemen simply because their expertise runs much deeper than ours.",
        "Okay.",
        "We have time for one last call.",
        "Ed(ph) in Berkeley, California, go right ahead.",
        "Good morning.",
        "I find the timing is very fishy for why this happened a weekend before a major election in the United States, and it give us to the power of fear, how we using fear to scare the Americans.",
        "Al-Qaida is a loose-knit group.",
        "So they're really don't more scary than some people in our Bay Area, Oakland or Richmond.",
        "And it's just they make a big deal out it.",

        "And you will see this is a total manipulation of the American mind.",
        "Al-Qaida is this group, they're bunch of losers, hoodlum.",
        "And they cause more damage to Muslims and Arabs than anybody who did in whole history."

        "I mean, we have in a sense, we've over-exaggerated the threat of al-Qaida just from the sheer number of the horrible calculation.",
        "It's not a threat to, you know, the existence of the United States in any sense.",
        "We have lived off fear since 9/11, and now we're living off the fear that these people could knock down airplanes.",
        "As for the timing, you can only speculate because we don't know who was behind these bombings.",

        "There's vast parts of Yemen that dont even take allegiance to Sana'a, or the president.",

        "All right.",
        "So that's are there efforts, I imagine, underway to try and improve that?",
        "Well, there's only so much you can do.",

        "I mean, the entire Middle East has gone through a political process which we cannot control, and you just have to hope for the best.",
