        "And we all go through countless briefings on operational security, I mean, COMSEC, OPSEC.",

        "There are exceptions.",
        "And if you read the policy, you can see the exceptions.",
        "But their exceptions are supposed to deal with temporary blockage, if you need it for security reasons or operational concerns.",
        "Right.",

        "I did want to comment on something, actually on the question you asked, how does this help the war fighter?",
        "One of the things that's interesting about social media, the software behind it, is that the U.S.",
        "military uses it, as we're speaking, to update its counterinsurgency manual.",
        "Men and women who are in the field fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq are sending back and communicating with people back here in the States to update the counterinsurgency manual, how we fight counterinsurgency wars, in real time.",
        "We don't have to wait several years or until the conflict is over to do that, and we're able to do that because of this technology.",
        "It's also interesting, back on the morale part of it, to have seen the first part of the new many miniseries on HBO, \"\"The Pacific,\"\" and to see soldiers on Guadalcanal in 1942 reading their mail to each other.",
        "This is the modern equivalent of that.",

        "When you have access - my concern is with your guest - if you have access to it on your work computer in that environment, it can also create a loophole or an inroad for hackers - big problems with Russia and China getting in to the unclassified system and working their way up from there.",

        "And the kind of common sense rules of using it should be applied here.",
        "I do find it interesting with social media sites that for some reason there seems to be an opposite effect of more people can see it and read it, and therefore your audience is bigger, any damage to be done is larger.",
        "And yet, people often - and it's often that young people, think they can say and do things they wouldn't ever say or do in front of their own parents or grandmother, yet they'll say and do it through social media - YouTube or Facebook.",
        "Right.",
