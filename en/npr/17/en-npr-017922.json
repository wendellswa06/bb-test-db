        "He said that having racially and ethnically diverse student bodies is important, but he refused to say if it's important enough to justify affirmative action policies.",
        "Answering questions about presidential power, he said that the president is not above the law.",
        "But when senators asked whether the president has the power under the Constitution to violate laws that he believes interfere with his war-making duties, well, Alito refused to say.",
        "And when asked whether Congress has the power to strip the courts of jurisdiction to rule on constitutional issues, he likewise refused to answer.",
        "And I could go on, but you get the drift.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Well, what do you think of what Charles Fried said, he tends--he's in the mainstream, but tends toward the right?",
        "Is that how you think Judge Alito emerged, or is he really going to tend toward the right and be a kindred spirit to Justice Clarence Thomas, say, or Justice Scalia on the court?",
        "I don't think he'll be like Justice Thomas, who doesn't believe in precedent at all.",
        "I mean, he...",
        "Although I think he said he did at his confirmation hearings.",
        "That's something else.",
        "But this guy, I take at his word that he really does believe in precedent, and so I think he will be somewhere between Justice Scalia and maybe the late Justice Harlan.",
        "I think he's going to be a pretty conservative judge.",
        "We've had two Supreme Court confirmation hearings in the past few months.",
