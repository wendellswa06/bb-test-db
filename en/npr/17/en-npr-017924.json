        "Before the summit opened, there was a lot of attention on Venezuela and its populist president, Hugo Chavez.",
        "There were demonstrations in the streets and he addressed the rally.",
        "How big a role did he play?",
        "Well, President Bush came here, according to the White House, hoping to not let Hugo Chavez become the focus of the summit.",
        "Now if you look outside the summit, he became a central focus.",
        "He held a huge rally at a stadium here in town right off the summit site.",
        "He drew thousands and thousands of anti-Bush protesters and rallied them before he went in to join Mr. Bush inside the summit.",
        "Inside, we don't know what kind of influence he had.",
        "What we do know is that Venezuela and Hugo Chavez represent the position that is against the United States.",
        "They do not want the free-trade pact, and Hugo Chavez believes that free trade and expanding trade is actually bad for the poor of Latin America.",
        "He disagrees vehemently with Mr. Bush.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, NPR's David Greene, traveling with President Bush in Latin America, thanks very much.",
        "Pleasure, Jacki.",
        "Detroit rhythm and blues singer Bettye Lavette had a couple of hit records in the 1960s.",
        "After that, she disappeared from the charts, but that doesn't mean she stopped working and recording.",
        "On her new album, she covers 10 songs.",
        "All are written by women, and they roughly follow the story of Lavette's life.",
        "The CD is called \"\"I've Got My Own Hell to Raise.\"\" Meredith Ochs has a review.",
        "(Soundbite of \"\"Joy\"\")",
        "(Singing) Joy...",
        "Bettye Lavette's voice possesses an undeniable power.",
        "Unlike a lot of soul singers, Lavette didn't grow up singing gospel music in church.",
        "Hers is a pure blues growl, fiercely emotional, commanding you to pay attention the way Aretha Franklin demanded respect.",
        "(Soundbite of \"\"Joy\"\")",
        "(Singing) Oh, my joy.",
        "I don't like it no more 'cause they took my joy.",

        "On this song, an intense reconfiguring of Lucinda Williams' \"\"Joy,\"\" Lavette retraces the steps of her lengthy career, replacing Lucinda's map of the South with one of her own travails: Detroit, New York, Memphis, Mussel Shoals; each destination a city where Lavette took a shot at stardom and was robbed of what might have been hers.",
        "(Soundbite of \"\"Joy\"\")",
        "(Singing) Maybe in Memphis I'd find joy.",
        "So then I went to Mussel Shoals looking for my joy, went to Mussel Shoals looking for my joy.",
        "I thought maybe in the Shoals, I could find some joy.",
        "Maybe in the Shoals, I could find some some joy.",

        "Nouri al-Maliki, now the prime minister, was in Syria as a representative of the Da'wah Party in exile.",
        "But a lot of their leadership, really, in Baghdad, were Shiite figures who were in Iran or Syria or London who came back after the American invasion.",
        "They're associated with religious parties like the Supreme Council or the Da'wah Party, which is a minority party that Maliki belongs to.",
        "Those that were in Iraq during this period include a lot of the tribes.",
        "And they endured Saddam Hussein and they basically want a piece of the action now.",
        "And another division you write about is between those who are in power and those who are out.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, those who are in power are - tend to be the political, the religious parties, and who have their representatives in Baghdad, which is Maliki, Al-Hakim.",
        "He's the Supreme Council.",
        "The Supreme Council figure and his son who is the heir apparent.",
        "These are the insiders, the political insiders in the regime in Baghdad.",
        "Of course, they have their own contest for power among themselves and Iraq is always filled with rumors about conspiracies and plots of every kind.",
        "Those who have tended to have been marginalized are the Shiite tribes in the south and to a certain extent, the Satras in the south, who have a lot of support among the kind of the working or lower classes of Iraqi society.",
        "Supporters of Muqtada al-Sadr who also stayed behind.",
        "He was a young man at the time but kind of a wild card in this equation.",
        "Yes.",
        "He stayed behind at the time.",
        "But now he's in exile.",
        "He's in Iran and supposedly conducting his religious studies.",
        "So what you really have is - you know, we've tended to think about Iraq as a struggle between Sunni and Shiite, and really what it is, is these days, it's a struggle between the insiders and the outsiders, those who have power in Baghdad and outsiders who want power, and the outsiders include Shiite tribes and they also include Sunni tribes."

        "And another difference, you write, again, speaking about the Shiites, are the religious parties, which tend to be based in the cities and being very religious, strict observers of Islam, and the more rural yet more secular tribes.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, I saw this myself in Diwaniyah, which is a city in southern Iraq where you had a governor from the Supreme Council spent almost 20 years in Iran and refused to shake the hand of a woman, for example.",
        "But then you would have tribal leaders, some of whom would drink or quite comfortable in the company of women and were more secular oriented.",
        "And essentially, what your article is about is an effort to sort of mirror the Sunni awakening, use the tribes as they were used - the Sunni tribes in Anbar province were the engine that helped the U.S.",
        "Marines principally defeat al-Qaeda in that part of the country - and to create a Shiite awakening.",
        "But it was perceived as a political threat to the established parties.",
        "Yeah, basically what the story is, and it's a story that I pretty much stumbled upon in Iraq when I was in Diwaniyah, and I met some kind of insurgency specialist who worked for General Patreaus, investigates the following question.",
        "We have a Sunni awakening in Amar.",
        "Why isn't there a Shiite awakening in the south?",
        "How come we don't have the same sorts of tribes rising up, let's say, against the Mahdi Army the way the Sunni tribes rose up against al-Qaeda?",
        "How come the American military doesn't have that sort of relationship?",
        "And the short answer is, as the article explains, it was attempted by the American military.",
        "It actually began to happen and it was shutdown on the orders of the Iraqi prime minister, Prime Minister Maliki, because he saw the emergence of Shiite tribes in this Shiite south as a potential political competition for his governing coalition of parties.",
        "Is there an analogy between al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia that was the enemy of the Sunni awakening and the militias, the Shiite militias?",
        "Well, there is to a certain extent.",
        "I mean, in Diwaniyah, the Mahdi Army and the so-called special groups that are supported with Iran terrorize that place and really had free reign, and they were a bane on that whole city which is of about half a million for some time, and the American military couldn't control it.",
        "We had such few forces in that part of Iraq and the tribes wanted them out and they wanted control over the situation.",
        "So there is a kind of a rough parallel.",
        "And what's sort of interesting is that there has been some dialogue between the Shiite tribes in the south and the Sunni tribes in Anbar.",
        "Shiite sheiks would go to Anbar for sort of - to get the lessons learned, so to speak, of how the Sunni tribes had aligned themselves with the Americans to fight al-Qaeda.",
        "What can you get out of the Americans?",
        "How can you work with them?",
        "But when they tried to apply those lessons in Diwaniyah, what they ran into was really the opposition of one of the dominant parties in Iraq, the Supreme Council, which is aligned with Prime Minister Maliki.",
        "Because they thought - they saw these - the Shiite tribes as political rivals.",
        "With provincial elections coming up later this year, absolutely.",
        "And it put the American government in an interesting situation because on the one hand, the American military is working to stand up the tribes in Anbar and in other parts of Iraq, I've seen this first hand, and we certainly have an interest in the political system being as inclusive as possible.",
        "So to that extent, there's an incentive to bring in the tribes in the south."

        "On the other hand, the American government wants Maliki to succeed and to be a strong figure and to certainly have command over the security situation through the Iraqi security forces.",
        "So the American government was pretty much caught in the middle.",
        "But when push came to shove, it sided with Maliki on this one.",
        "We're talking with Michael Gordon, the chief military correspondent of The New York Times about the politics of Iraq, specifically, the politics among Iraq's majority group, the Shiites.",
        "He says the conflict in Iraq has moved into a largely political phase now and the tussle for power is amongst these different Shiite forces, including the tribes.",

        "Which reconciliation are you talking about, Dale?",
        "Oh, well, the Sunnis being recognized and feeling like they are now getting back in.",
        "Part of the equation.",

        "Uh huh.",
        "Michael Gordon.",
        "The surge was really a necessary condition for the progress that we've seen in Iraq, incomplete though it is, because I've spent a fair amount of time in Iraq and the situation in '06 was really out of control.",
        "And you really were involved in - there was a lot of widespread sectarian killing and there had to be some way to tamp that down and also protect the population.",

        "And one of the things you say is - we just have a few seconds before the break, but how these elections are conducted, if they're seen as fair, who participates, who gets to participate, that's going to be critical.",
        "The two most important events in Iraq over the next year, year-and-a-half, are the provincial elections expected maybe in December or early next year, and then the national parliamentary elections next year.",
        "And whether they're conducted fairly and importantly, whether they're seen by Iraqis as having been conducting fairly, is absolutely critical for any hope to have stability in that country."
