        "Oh, I just wanted to comment on what we were talking about earlier and why it's more difficult to get a Shiite awakening versus a Sunni awakening.",
        "I'm an army interrogator and my experience in Iraq has taught me that a lot of the Shiites see the Mahdi Army leaders as religious leaders, first of all, and second of all, they also see the Shiite militiamen, which they are, as their family, as their friend, as their cousins, as their neighbors, whereas the Sunnis tend to feel like they're forced to cooperate with Al-Qaeda.",
        "I've interrogated both Sunnis and Shiites and that's always been my experience.",
        "It was always a lot easier to get information out of a Sunni person about Al-Qaeda than it was ever to get out of a Shiite person about the Mahdi Army.",
        "And the Mahdi Army, of course, the - again, the militia controlled by or to some degree by Muqtada al-Sadr.",

        "Absolutely, absolutely.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Let's get an answer from Michael Gordon.",
        "Well, I think there are number of factors that make it complicated to have a Shiite awakening.",
        "A big one is there are not a lot of American forces in the south, and it's hard to have an awakening without the American forces that they can ally themselves with.",
        "And there's a process in supervising them, paying them, taking biometric information, vetting them and all that.",
        "And we don't have a lot of forces in southern Iraq and so that's certainly an impediment.",
        "All right.",
        "The question I have is regarding religious identification, mainly Shiite versus Iraqi nationalism.",
        "If there are some characteristics of this, and if so, what are the implications for regional politics?",
        "Right.",
        "And so he followed the policy.",
        "He followed the rule because he believed so much in the military, it seems like that - it seems to be the conclusion.",
        "But I would point out that there was and sort of is a small-scale Shiite awakening in Kadasia province, and the article goes into this.",
        "What happened was they stood up several thousands of so-called Sons of Iraq, as they're called these days.",
        "They used to be called concerned local citizens before somebody figured out that in Arabic that came out sounding like very worried Iraqis.",
        "And so there are a couple of thousands of these guys, and they do protect the roads in Kadasia province, which is certainly important because Route Tampa, the main artery for U.S.",
        "supplies, comes through there.",
        "And they actually were stood up in the city themselves.",
        "And what the story explains is this process was actually underway and had begun when the kabash was put on it in Baghad.",
        "So, it's certainly not impossible to have a Shiite awakening if you want to encourage it.",
        "Also, Prime Minister Maliki reached out to the Tamin tribe when he mounted his Basra operation, and they had a group down there that used to be called Sons of Basra, though I'm not going to pronounce the acronym, but that sort of faded out because the government of Iraq didn't sustain it.",
        "So I think there are ways in which it's more complicated, but I think experience shows that it's not impossible.",
        "Sir, you're absolutely right.",
        "And just one final comment about what you said about the south.",
        "It's actually also a fact that most of the weapon smuggling that comes in through Iran comes to the south because - and I've heard this directly from guys who have smuggled weapons in from Iran to Iraq - that the British military takes kind of like a passive approach to the security and does not do security as well, basically, as U.S.",
        "forces.",
        "One thing I've also noted is that the tribes, the sheiks I talked to in Kadasia province are very anti-Iranian.",
        "They don't want the Iranian influence in Iraq, and they're very concerned about the smuggling of Iranian arms and financial support Iran has provided to militias.",
        "So there's that sort of dynamic, as well.",
        "Absolutely."

        "It's a fair question.",
        "I would disagree with the way it was phrased.",
        "I mean, these guys, and I've seen them in variety of different locations in Iraq, there are about 103,000 so-called Sons of Iraq now, predominantly Sunni.",
        "And they've been very effective in certainly shutting down Al-Qaeda, and some of them used to be insurgents themselves.",
        "They're subjected to a vetting process biometric data is taken.",
        "They take retina scans, fingerprints and whatnot, enter them into an intelligence database, so there is some control over them.",
        "That's to reduce the possibility of there being infiltrators from the militias.",
        "Right.",
        "And to weed out the bad actors, and occasionally they find some trying to join these groups.",
        "There are people who've been on the wanted list for killing Americans, for example, for some time.",
        "They get about 300 bucks a month.",
        "It's like a typical payment to a so-called Son of Iraq.",
        "It's not an enormous amount of money.",
        "In return, they perform a service in terms of security, and the command on Iraq has actually done assessments.",
        "They've looked at how much they pay these guys in certain provinces and how much violence has gone down.",
        "So, you know, if the damage to American Humvees is 50 or 60 percent less damage than you would ordinarily have because there are fewer roadside bombs, they actually figure it that we come out ahead kind of financially, and of course, you can't put a price on the American lives that are saved.",
        "But the questioner has an excellent point, which is, what's going to become of these people?",
        "And the theory is that these 103,000, that 20 to 30 percent of them will be absorbed in the Iraqi security forces before the end of the year, and that the remainder will somehow be given jobs or go to job training programs and that the Iraqi government itself will take responsibility for this.",
        "And this is all to happen by the end of this year.",
        "So this is a very critical transition that we need to keep our eye on and make sure that it's executed properly because if it isn't, it could be a significant problem in the future.",
        "And the model that you describe in this article, in Diwaniyah, in the Shiite area, that was the same idea, that people - there's very little economy, people are out of work, they would be paid for their security role.",
        "And indeed, they were for a little while but that was ended.",
        "Was that American money that was being paid out or was that Iraqi money that was being paid out?",
        "It was American money funneled through the polls, basically, which used to be - well, I guess, still is technically the contingent down there, although they're phasing out.",
        "The point is, a lot of people in Iraq with rampant unemployment and there are a number of people getting involved in insurgent militia activities purely to make a living.",
        "They get paid X amount of money for planting an IED, a little more if they take a videotape of a Humvee being attacked or an MRAP.",
        "And so it's possible to wean these people away from those movements and align them with the American-led coalition or the Iraqi government through some sort of financial livelihood.",
        "And I don't see what's wrong with that if you have a strategy to integrate them into the Iraqi security forces and to give them real jobs at the end of the line.",

        "Hi, Michael.",
        "You're on the air.",

        "I guess the way I'd - if I can rephrase your question, people wonder, well, since Iran is Shiite and the dominant group in Iraq is Shiite, is this some Shiite crescent or are the Iraqis different from the Iranians?",
        "And my sense, as always, is that the Iraqis are Iraqis first, that they have some cultural religious affinities on the Shiite side with the Iranians.",
        "They're certainly afraid of the Iranians at this point because Iraq is a weak country and Iran is a stronger country.",
        "They resent the Iranian interference to a certain extent in Iraq through arm shipments and aid to militias.",
        "But they don't want to confront them too directly.",
        "But I think, as a very gross generalization, I think there is a certain sense of nationalism in Iraq, which is why you do not see among Iraqis all that much support for these ideas to break Iraq into different kind of segments of Kurdish - maybe you might see it among the Kurds, but you know, Shiite and Sunni and Kurds.",
        "And among the Shiite themselves, I think that as I said, it just - what I observed in the south was a lot of these tribal leaders certainly consider themselves to be nationalist.",
        "They fought and they may have - or their sons fought in the war, you know, or their fathers fought in the war with Iran, which was an eight-year war.",
        "Yes.",
        "Wasn't it fair to say that both countries were surprised?",
        "I mean, Iraq invaded Iran in an area called Arabistan.",
        "And those are ethnic Arabs, largely, in that part of the country and were surprised that they did not rally to the Arab cause, as they saw it, and similarly, when the Iranians moved into Iraqi territory, they thought, these are fellow Shiites, they will support us, and both sides were surprised.",
        "It didn't work.",
        "Yeah, I think that Iran has influence in Iraq.",
        "They were party to, I think, some of these recent political understandings in Basra and Sadr City.",
        "There's some militias who go there for training.",
        "They certainly provide financial support to some political groups in Iraq, including groups that the Americans work with.",
        "But I think Iraqis see themselves as having a national identity apart from the Iranians.",

        "Thank you.",
        "All right.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "Let's - you also talked about this as a largely political struggle, and clearly that's greatly to be preferred than military struggle.",
        "But it has had military aspects, the move of Maliki's troops - Iraqi troops into places like Basra, and of course, into Sadr City in Baghdad.",
        "Right.",
        "I think - I was in Sadr City for five weeks during the sort of fighting phase of that, and I think certainly there were legitimate reasons for Maliki to order troops to Basra.",
        "I mean, it was an economic hub for his country, it's where the oil gets exported through their - that's the country's main source of livelihood.",
        "The place was out of control.",
        "There were all sorts of atrocities going on there, abuses, reports of kind of women being harassed for not wearing full religious garb and worse.",
        "So there was a legitimate reason to assert his sovereignty there and in Sadr City."
