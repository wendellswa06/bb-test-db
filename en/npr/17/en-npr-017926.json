        "But it also fulfilled a political objective of his, which is it brought Basra, a major city, under government control, or brought Sadr City, a major neighborhood in Baghdad, under government control prior to the holding of provincial elections.",
        "And I think that Maliki and his governing coalition did not want to go into elections without asserting control over these areas, controlling the services, the patronage, the mechanisms of wielding influence there because when they go into these elections, they want to get a positive result.",
        "So I think there was a legitimate security reason for going in there.",
        "But I also think there was a political motivation.",
        "Just to clarify, the oil in the southern or Shiite parts of the country is shipped out by sea from Basra and Unkasar(ph) in the northern area around Kirkuk, that oil is sent by pipeline through Turkey and then off to the rest of the world.",

        "But, hey, listen, as we saw this thing transition now into the political phase here, political struggle, you think there's any correlations between how we, the U.S., approach Iran?",
        "Would that correlate with the stability that we are going to be able to achieve in Iraq given the, you know, the heavy Shiite in the dominance, you know, what you talked about.",
        "Basically, can we reconcile in Iraq if we don't even get on the road to reconcile in Iran?",
        "I just wanted to hear what you had to say about that.",
        "It's an excellent question to which I don't have a crisp answer.",
        "I mean, Iran has been a meddlesome and negative presence in Iraq through their - they provide roadside bombs, the most effective type, known as EFPs.",
        "And they provide the financial aid to militias.",
        "And you know, in recent months, this has abated somewhat but no one's quite sure exactly why.",
        "You know, I think that there's not much of a dialogue going on between the United States and Iran now.",
        "And I'm not sure that if there was, our interest and their interest could be fully aligned, given the other outstanding differences over their nuclear program.",
        "And just a new ultimatum today, that their deadlines are passed and there'll be more UN sanctions if Iraq - if Iran does not...",
        "But one thing I would - one new element here, the Iraqi government is talking to Iran.",
        "And in recent months, particularly, the Iraqis found a large cache of Iranian arms in Basra.",
        "And they sent a delegation to Iran to discuss this and I'm sure it wasn't very confrontational, but in their own way to try to ask the Iranians to be less of intrusive kind of presence in kind of the Iraqi fight."

        "Clearly, Iran could be more troublesome if they chose to be in Iran - in Iraq, rather.",
        "At times, the struggles between Israel and Hezbollah and elsewhere in the Middle East is described as a proxy war between Iran and the United States.",
        "And clearly, Iran could make more trouble if it wanted to.",
        "I think Iran's strategy is to use the threat that it could stir up trouble through Hezbollah, through its - the militias it supports in Iraq, which, as American intelligence understands it, some of their leadership is trained by Hezbollah in Iran.",
        "To use that threat is a way to deter the United States from taking military action against Iran in the context of their nuclear weapons program.",
        "I'm not advocating that kind of military action, but the - I think the Iranians have out there the sort of understood capability to activate, you know, the Hezbollah, Hamas groups like that that they support and also to stir up further trouble for us in Iraq, or at least to try.",

        "Well, I guess, first I would go back to your statement that he was perhaps the first gay soldier killed, and offer the caveat that maybe he was the first known gay soldier killed.",
        "And that answers your question, which is, how do we know, in a policy that enforces secrecy on those members of the military who serve and are gay, how do we know who is and who isn't gay?",
        "Alan Rogers is someone who - although he was a career soldier, spent almost 20 years in the military - had, for the last few years of his life, been working with a group in Washington called American Veterans for Equal Rights, trying to overturn the policy.",
        "Now, he essentially led two lives, the way your story tells it, it seems.",

        "The second of those, you might say that these aren't in rank order, he was also an ordained Baptist minister.",

        "And a third component, if there are only three, would be perhaps that he was an active member of the gay community in Washington, D.C., and particularly the gay military community.",
        "What is known about how he was able to keep, certainly, the gay and the straight life so separate?",
        "How did he manage to do that?",
        "Well, amazingly, one of the features of the policy is that it is not just \"\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\"\" but don't harass and don't pursue, and although he worked in military intelligence, most of the people he worked with in the Pentagon and in the military had no idea that he was gay despite the fact that he sent emails to a Yahoo discussion group under his own name in the gay community.",
        "He was someone who was very good at blending into - to his surroundings.",
        "He's someone - I think no one who knew him thought of him, except for maybe those who worked with him with the veteran's group, thought of him as an activist.",
        "He was someone who simply really believed in the military.",
        "He was proud of who he was in his various other endeavors and was just not determined to ruffle any feathers.",
        "Admiral Barnett, what's your reaction to that story?",
        "Definitely, he did.",
        "The question then would be if after 20 years - some of his friends have said that he was thinking of leaving the military - having spent 15 of those 20 years in the military living under the policy of secrecy, he was beginning to think that he couldn't continue and also achieve a kind of long-lasting private life.",
        "And one of the points you make in your article is that this would have been a tremendous loss to the military, that he was the kind of person that the military not only would need, but really want this kind of person in the military.",
        "Certainly.",
        "I mean, when the Pentagon had a memorial service for Major Rogers after he died and the number of very high-ranking people attended, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Gordon England, for whom Rogers had worked as a special assistant, was there, and a number of generals and high-ranking people spoke of him as though he were among the best soldiers they'd ever served with.",

        "Well, it's true.",
        "I went down to one of his best friends, perhaps his best friend, his - the benefactor of his - and the executor of his will received all of his personal effects a couple of months after his death down in Florida.",
        "And I went down and looked through some of those effects with his friend, and one of them was a kind of bongo drum that Rogers had received as a parting gift from his troops in Korea where he served two tours.",
        "And on the drum they had decorated - they'd written on the skin of the drum as though it were a kind of interrogation form, for this was a military intelligence unit, and it had a kind of joking tone.",
        "It joked about the, you know, the objects, the documents that would be on this person's possession, this person being Major Rogers, and they talked about, you know, searching for my perfect bride, you know, a book unsuccessfully well used, and you know, \"\"It's Raining Men\"\" CD.",

        "These kind of, sort of signifiers that I think, at least in today's world, we might associate with the gay community.",
        "Now it's interesting that after his death, something of a controversy broke out about whether it should be revealed that he was gay or not.",
        "That's true.",
        "When - after he died, there was some press in The Washington Post and elsewhere - some of his friends in the gay community in Washington, I think rightly thought that this might be a good story to approach the policy that we're talking about right now.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I should mention here that NPR actually did a profile of him at the time of his death.",

        "Right.",
        "And one of the other issues, I would say, is that the family, in this case - Alan Rogers was a kind of ultimate American orphan, in some ways.",
        "He was put up for adoption when he was born in New York and lived then with his adoptive parents, who were somewhat older, both in the housing projects in the south Bronx and then in Florida.",
        "He had no siblings and both of those parents then died when he was about, I think, 30 or 32 years old.",
        "And so at the time of his death, his family - his closest family were cousins of his adoptive parents, and that made it, I think, particularly hard in the aftermath to determine who should we turn to, to find out how to remember this man.",
        "We're talking with Ben McGrath about his story, \"\"A Soldier's Legacy,\"\" which is in the current issue of The New Yorker, and let's take a call now from Frank in Virginia Beach, Virginia.",
