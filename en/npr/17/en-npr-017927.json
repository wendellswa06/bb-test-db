        "Instead, Cynthia Smith, a spokeswoman for the Department of Defense, provided this statement: \"\"Section 654 of Title 10 United States code requires the Department of Defense to separate from the armed forces members who engage in, attempt to engage in, or solicit another person to engage in homosexual acts, state that they are homosexual or bisexual, or marry or attempt to marry a person of the same biological sex.",

        "There are two ways that we can approach this and one - what you just heard from Ben McGrath, is how it affects individual members, and the fact that just shows that it's just wrong.",
