        "He more or less likened it to the ambiguity over weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.",
        "He said that the meddling in the election has been going on for a long time.",
        "So that's really some interesting backdrop for his sit-down with Vladimir Putin tomorrow.",
        "He also slammed news outlets, including CNN and NBC.",
        "He said that they were fake news.",
        "And then he stood by as the Polish president described why he's restricting Polish media outlets from covering Parliament.",
        "So this appearance in Poland was closely watched, in part because Poland's right-wing government has caused some anxiety, given its perceived crackdown on democratic institutions in that country."

        "But, you know, as you mentioned - more to your point, he - Trump is said to have a lot in common ideologically with Poland's political leaders because that party, the Law and Justice Party, rose to power by driving a populist movement.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, they stoked ethnic nationalism.",
        "They refuse to accept refugees.",
        "They muscled in on the media.",
        "And they've showed - they've shown, you know, disdain really for the European Union.",
        "So - and there was also a political calculation, too, for the reason why Poland is the first up.",
        "There are hundreds of thousands of Polish-American voters who live in battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.",
