        "And it's good to have you on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Let's start by assessing the situation 50 years later.",
        "How segregated are we?",
        "Well, it still is the case today in 2005 that where you live is highly likely to reflect not just your race but your socioeconomic class.",
        "Since, however, we've made quite a bit of progress.",
        "The most progress we've made, frankly, is in establishing social consensus.",
        "The day that Rosa Parks refused to step off of the bus or give up her seat--the prevailing social consensus, not just in the South but in much of America, was separate but equal is fine.",
        "OK.",
        "And in the mid- to late '50s 80 percent of whites said they would move if their neighborhood was invaded by large numbers of black people.",
        "Today social consensus is the opposite.",
        "In opinion polls, whites say--large majorities of them say they wouldn't mind living in a neighborhood with numbers of blacks.",
        "That said, there's a lot of dissonance between those professed values and where people actually choose to live, and in social surveys when people are asked to actually pick ideal neighborhoods, they tend to pick neighborhoods where their own race is in a majority.",
        "And by picking those neighborhoods, they also tend to pick the schools that their children attend, and they also tend to pick the churches that they attend.",
        "They're actually picking an entire lifestyle.",
        "You know, if our life space is very segregated, which is the case, we're much less likely to have daily interactions with people who are racially and economically different.",
        "So yes, we still have an America very much premised on separation.",
        "Fifty years ago, the perception was that it was a de jure legal segregation in the South, and de facto--or just as matters of choice--in the North.",
        "Is there any regional distinction today?",
        "I don't think there is any regional distinction in that sense.",
        "You know, Jim Crow is no longer on the books anywhere.",
        "I think there is--I'm sorry.",
        "Can you repeat the question?",
        "Yeah, no. It's all--that was the question..."

        "Yeah.",
        "...is the South, where the problem was perceived to be worst 50 years ago--is it worse there or is it...",
        "Actually, the South ironically to some people, not to me as a Southerner, is doing better than some other regions.",
        "The most segregated place--region in the country is a the Midwest followed by the Northeast.",
        "The South is doing better than those places, and the West is doing better than the rest of the country.",
        "You write about several communities that are somewhat more integrated.",
        "Where are they and why are they more integrated?",
        "Well, about 5 to 10 percent of American neighborhoods buck this dominant trend of race and class segregation.",
        "You can find them all over, but they tend--there are two different types.",
        "There are these older communities of black-white where, you know, in mostly Jewish communities when blacks first as integration pioneers started moving into white neighborhoods and they started opening up housing markets in the '60s, there were some places like Shaker Heights, Ohio, Westmount area of Philadelphia, Oak Park outside of Chicago--places where people consciously tried to stem white flight and create stable integration.",
        "Smith, whose home is still standing - but barely - shook the president's hand.",
        "Obama gave his two sons small boxes of White House M&Ms.",
        "And, Mayor Shaw, what would the proposed closure of Ellsworth do to your city and your state?",
        "Well, in terms of the city and the western part of the state, it is the largest employer.",
        "And so it would be devastating, at least in the short term, to have 3,000-plus direct employees and probably double that in terms of affected employees.",
        "That is upwards of 10 percent of our total population, not just the work force.",
        "Rapid City is about 60,000 people.",
        "So it would have a tremendous impact, especially short-term.",
        "On the other hand, this is an Air Force base that was once connected to all the missile silos in South Dakota.",
        "It's post-Cold War now.",
        "Why not close the base?",
        "Well, in one respect, this base, of course, goes back to World War II, so it's about 60 years old.",
        "And from that point of view, the needs have changed dramatically.",
        "And we lost about half the military employees who were at Ellsworth over the last several years.",
        "And, frankly, we've been able to absorb that loss very well.",
        "So..."

        "Then why not be optimistic about life after Ellsworth closing?",
        "Well, I think we have to be.",
        "We're on kind of a parallel track, and not surprisingly our first order of business is going to be to examine the criteria, examine all the reasons that may be in the Department of Defense summary that we haven't seen yet but expect to next week, to see if any errors have been made.",
        "We were shocked and, frankly, angered to find out we were on the list because we've done so much in the community up to and including moving a whole interstate exit to try to ensure the long-term viability of Ellsworth.",
        "Keeping Ellsworth Air Force Base open has been no small political issue in South Dakota.",
        "It has been much talked about.",
        "And, in fact, this past fall in the Senate election, which saw former Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle lose to Republican Senator John Thune, the retaining of Ellsworth Air Force Base as a vital part of the military was one of the campaign issues.",
        "Candidate Thune said, `I'm a Republican, so,' he said, `I have the ear of the president.'",
        "Yes.",

        "Yes.",
        "...and he says we'll continue to keep Ellsworth open.",
        "He was very emphatic.",
        "And, in fact, everyone echoes the same thing: anger and shock that the decision by the Department of Defense is flat wrong.",
        "And we need to do all we can to try to get the BRAC commission now to change this recommendation and keep Ellsworth open in the future.",

        "This past week, award-winning photographer John Moore from Getty Images photographed a 2-year-old Honduran girl at the U.S.-Mexico border.",
        "It's taken from her vantage point.",
        "The adults are looming over her in the dark out of frame, and she's crying as her mother is searched.",

        "We came across a group of undocumented immigrants, mostly families, women and children.",
        "And I could see the fear on their faces, in their eyes.",
        "As the Border Patrol took people's names down, I could see a mother holding a young child.",
        "And when it came time for that mother and the 2-year-old daughter to be searched before transportation to the processing center, they asked the mother to set down her daughter.",
        "At that moment, the young child broke into tears, and she started wailing.",
        "And I took a knee and had very few frames of that moment before it was over.",
        "And she picked up her daughter, and they were rushed into the van and all taken away.",

        "And she looked at me and said, we've been on the road for a month.",
        "And I knew at that moment that this point in their journey, which was very emotional for me to see them being detained, for them was just part of a very, very long journey.",
        "You're an award-winning photographer, and you've covered war and chaos.",
        "And I should mention that we're friends because we often covered the same things in the Middle East and Latin America.",
        "And you've been taking pictures at the border for the last decade.",
        "What did you see this past week more broadly?",
        "Having covered this story for the last 10 years, I've seen a lot along the way.",
        "But in this case, this last week, it was different because I knew that what happened after these pictures were taken was going to be something very different.",
        "Most of us here had heard the news that the administration had planned to separate families.",
        "And these people really had no idea about this news.",
        "And it was hard to take these pictures, knowing what was coming next.",
        "Yeah.",
