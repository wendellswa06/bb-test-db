        "But sometimes memoirs do get written early, like one that has just now been published, and whose author is an NPR executive.",
        "He is mid-40s, and he is mid-career.",
        "But the hook to his book, and its charm, is the confession it makes that not that long ago, in his 20s, he was a guy who didn't go to college; who was working as a janitor in a clothing store; who had his suicide vaguely planned out; and who was checked into a mental hospital.",
        "I asked him earlier today if it would be fair to describe him as lost, at that time in his life.",
        "Yeah, he nodded; I was lost.",
        "So now, he is found.",
        "Eric Nuzum, NPR's vice president for programming at NPR, has written about his former and previous self by revisiting that time when he was lost, and then at rock bottom; to explain why he was there, and what it was like when it's not so clear that someday, you will climb out.",
        "Giving Up the Ghost\"\" is the name of the book.",
        "And yes, it is also - literally - a bit of a ghost story, and a love story.",

        "A different person than I am now.",
        "I think I was - well, I'm sure the elements are the same, but at that time, I was probably on the external, kind of a goofy, happy-go-lucky guy.",
        "What was your look?",
        "It kind of changed every couple days, I think.",
        "My hair color would change, the clothes I would wear - I loved thrift stores, so I would go find things.",
        "I felt, my entire teen years - as many people do, to some degree - as kind of an outsider, an outcast.",
        "I often describe myself as feeling like I was an interloper in my own life, of the - never feeling much of a sense of connection.",
        "So I made my physical self resemble that, in some way.",
        "It wasn't - I was kind of like the Amish of teenagers, in that it wasn't that I needed to be - I just needed to be un-modern or unconnected, un-contemporary.",
        "So it wasn't that I was trying to be anti-something, as much as just obviously different than what most mainstream things would be."

        "And I was kind of all those things mixed together.",

        "I loved music, intensely loved music.",

        "The Fed wants to encourage low employment if they can, but they want to absolutely keep inflation from getting too high.",

        "That's when they start saying, let's raise interest rates, let's make it a little harder to borrow money.",

        "Well, let's figure out that part of it because the Fed is supposed to be independent of politics, but don't they have to take into consideration how much the government - how much any new president spends, how much any new Congress spends, whether they have a big deficit or a smaller deficit, all those kinds of things?",
        "Exactly, and the picture has changed a lot since the election.",
        "Most people in Washington and the markets expect a tax cut, an increase in spending on defense for sure, maybe on infrastructure.",
        "And so, in the short run, that'll give the economy a little more oomph.",
        "And that's leading people to think the Fed may raise interest rates a little faster than had been expected before the election.",
        "Why, because they worry about a little too much oomph, as you put it?",

        "Mortgage rates, for instance, which were 3.5 percent on a 30-year mortgage earlier this year, are now well above 4 percent.",

        "So, what is the Osprey able to do that really makes it unique?",
        "Really, it gives you the speed and the range of a fixed-wing aircraft.",
