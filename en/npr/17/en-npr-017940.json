        "So she was really the only friend I had.",

        "And I was haunted by the guilt that I had somehow caused the accident because I used to listen to the radio without the engine on.",
        "So I thought the battery went dead.",
        "It was a long story but for years, I felt haunted and responsible.",
        "And fast-forward to about the age of 19.",
        "I found myself on a farm in eastern Kentucky, throwing myself into a river - forgetting what a good swimmer I was.",
        "And the image of a spiritual master that sort of embodies compassion, came to me.",
        "And I pulled myself out of that river.",
        "And it's been that spiritual feeling of compassion, and water, that have kind of saved my life.",
        "And it - ironically enough, my little sister was an excellent swimmer.",
        "So right now, I'm standing in a body of water about to go swimming, and listen - and telling my story to the world, and thanking you so much for the story about giving up the ghost because it literally felt like I was carrying my sister's ghost with me.",
        "And now, every time I swim, I have a tribute to her life and her love.",

        "And I think I would like her to go into a hospital, just - you know, I keep telling her just for observation, just for a few days; and see what they say.",
        "What's her reaction to that?",
        "At one point, it was positive, and right now it's changed.",

        "Yeah, I think about - you know, I actually don't mention this in my book, but probably one of the greatest gifts that anyone gave me at this time was my mother.",
        "On the day that I wrecked my car, and I was kind of loopy - you know, I had been doing some of the same things, been talking - I was very good at hiding my life from my family.",
        "They had no idea how out of control things had gotten and were quite shocked when they learned.",

        "It's one of the many steps.",
        "And I just wanted to say personally, my story would be, I had the same sort of feeling of being lost, and not knowing what I was supposed to do.",

        "I just knew it wasn't there.",
        "And so I decided to quit that lifestyle.",
        "And quitting that lifestyle brought along a lot of depression; a lot of those thoughts that I'd been pushing aside, as far as what am I supposed to be doing?",
        "And I started feeling very alone and very disconnected, as the guest was talking about.",
        "And for me, I just put structure in my life, structure that I knew was for me, like, things I could take care of - keeping my apartment clean, doing my best to take care of my bills, and most importantly, keeping myself physically healthy because I knew that my brain would be healthy then.",
        "So I started getting the nutrients that I needed and eating properly, and exercising a few days a week.",
        "And that, I really have to say, made me realize that I'm living my life for me, and that I'm in control of my life.",
        "And no matter what I do, as long as I feel good, which, eating properly and exercising, and keeping things in order in my life - because ultimately, I felt a great sense of disorder - that helped me feel better, and pulled me out of it.",
        "And again, I just want to say thank you for writing this because that is what this book is, to me.",
        "That's what people telling their story is; is it's giving people who are in that place where you feel like it's never going to get better, it gives them a chance for hope.",
        "And it lets them know that other people have been through this, too, which is so, so very important...",
        "David, thanks very much for your call, and for your comment.",
        "You know, Eric...",
        "Thank you.",
        "...David mentioned something about how much he appreciates that you're talking about this.",
        "And - here's a question that I was thinking as I was reading the book, knowing - you know - where you are in life now; that you're an executive at NPR; you're respected.",
        "Sometimes you're a guy wearing a tie - you know, window office, authority, responsibility.",
        "People look up to you; people are counting on you.",
        "Do you have - do you see - do you look back on the previous you, and that's a different guy?",
        "Or do you have a - still a direct connection to who you were 20 years ago?",
        "Is there continuity for you?",
        "Now, now, Senator Obama has said that he would roll back the Bush tax cut.",
        "Is that what you mean in terms of personal taxes?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Sometimes, I think I am me today, which is just a crust or a layer on top of the person I used to be; and it's still under there, in some ways.",
        "But the way I choose to look at it is - you know, I do have a moment that I describe in the story, of being in a hospital and actually making the decision - while listening to a piece of music, hidden off in a room - that I didn't want to live this way anymore."

        "That certainly isn't the case.",

        "She knew - she could probably sketch it out in a 30-second version, but she didn't know anything about the details of it.",
        "And most shockingly for her - I finished writing it, and she read it for the first time, when she was pregnant with our son.",
        "So she was like, why didn't you tell me this before we decided to start a family?",
        "But I think she's kind of come to realize that - you know, Billy Kyles, who was on the balcony with - when Martin Luther King was shot, said history gives us witnesses to tell what happened.",

        "I was failing every subject in school and was trying to figure out how to turn it around.",
        "Lots of neighbors, other parents and teachers did their best to encourage me.",

        "In succession, my girlfriend dumped me; the woman who hired me over the summer gave me my last pay and said, you're a good hard worker, but you're just too much trouble, I can't have you back; lastly, my swim coach, who was my guidance counselor, told me if I didn't get my act together, I was going to end up in Vietnam as a grunt.",
        "In short order, because of all this, I changed - earned straight A's, graduated high school with honors, won a scholarship to college.",
        "He's asking: Can you talk about folks who might have gotten your attention not by encouraging you, but by giving you the bad news about yourself?",
        "Oh, I had no shortage of people who gave me the bad news about myself, and even people who encouraged me but just didn't quite know what to say.",
        "So I found the people who were the most influential to me, at that time in my life, were the people who were just doing interesting things with their life and were interesting people - be they a musician or a writer, or some weird guy that I had met through some friend, or something like that.",
        "Like, the people who really were embracing life and making it their own, and stopped making excuses, I think, was the thing that had the most influence on me during that time."
