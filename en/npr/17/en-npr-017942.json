        "Now, feel free to look into the collusion part, too, but I doubt very much they're going to find anything that affected the election.",
        "So - but, hey, if they want to - if the FBI wants to investigate it, go right ahead, you know.",

        "I grew up in Memphis in the late 1980s, early 1990s, and Memphis is a city which historically has been divided a close 50-50 between black and white.",
        "And my school in Memphis at the time was also 50 percent white, 50 percent black.",
        "But Memphis had a tracking system in the public schools where you had regular courses and you had what's considered the advanced or optional program, which was more academically accelerated.",
        "And even though my school was half black and half white, looking back on my childhood it was obvious that the optional program was always white with one or two black students and the regular program was always black with one or two white students.",
        "And so I'm curious to hear your guest's thoughts on even within the same school, which is integrated on its surface, the reality of the classroom was very much still segregated.",
        "Well, I don't think your experience was atypical.",
        "Unfortunately, it's not enough just to throw people into an ostensibly integrated situation.",
        "Institutions have to work at diversity.",
        "They have to work at creating true inclusion, and it's very easy to take the path of least resistance and not work to do that.",
        "And unfortunately, all too often, you know, this is what America often does.",
        "They track people not just into winner and loser tracks within schools, but into winner and loser communities.",
        "And there seems to be this prevailing philosophy that if that's the way markets are that's OK, that, you know, individuals can just try to make it on their own.",
        "And what I'm--the main message of my book is that we have to pay attention to how you cultivate over time truly inclusive neighborhoods, truly inclusive schools, truly inclusive institutions.",

        "You grew up in Alabama in the 1950s.",
        "In your opinion, how far along--are we still segregated?",
        "Well, we certainly are not segregated in terms of our constitutional structure.",
        "Both at the federal and state level, we are far from being integrated, so I think as Professor Cashin indicated, the Jim Crow system, the separate-but-equal apartheid system, that I grew up under has largely been eliminated, but in its place obviously is a class-based, economic-based, with a racial definition, separateness in all aspects of American life.",
        "And I think it's probably even more--I shouldn't say even more--but it certainly has similarities to what I experienced.",
        "It is more so based upon income now.",
        "So it is not--we don't live in an integrated society; we do not live also in a segregated society.",
        "I think there are larger--the question and the fight is over the social space that we will occupy, and I think the integration that we're seeking is largely going to proceed from private as well as governmental activities that creates a social space wherein everybody can have the same level of dignity.",
        "And that social space will be occupied by things that we now are debating, livable wages, equitable and adequate education as a birthright for all children; adequate and equitable health care for all children.",
        "And once you create those and access to credit at a minimal level for all people--once you create that, then the integration that Professor Cashin and I and others are looking for will begin to proceed.",
        "Now I know you've argued that we need new kinds of language to talk about race and integration.",
        "Give us an example, if you would.",
        "The other thing I think we need to talk about, as we talk about how we integrate and how we deal with segregation, is that while people may be segregated physically, some of them, especially our young, live in a virtual community where while they're separated physically they are virtually together through the Internet, through their accessing certain kinds of mass media across race and culture, and they begin to carry out some of the same attributes and behaviors.",

        "It took Thurgood Marshall and Charles Houston and others a quarter of a century to develop the jurisprudence that would guide a nation out of apartheid.",
        "So we cannot expect to adopt their vocabulary and apply it to 2005 America.",
        "We have to develop a voca--and it will be a very, very difficult fight, as it was for them, to come up with a vocabulary of a type--I just put out, for example, an approach, a paradigm.",
        "Many Americans don't agree with that.",
        "My paradigm is one of universal access to minimal things required for a life of dignity.",
        "There's great division in our nation about that.",
        "We need to fight through that.",
        "Once we do that, then it'll be very difficult to have some people seeking access based upon race and class to health care through emergency rooms.",
        "It'll be very difficult for real estate markets to target people into enclaves of poverty, or enclaves of exclusive affluency based upon income differences.",
        "That's the struggle that we are part of, but we have to find a way to come up with the words and the vocabulary to describe this so that we can move forward and debate it in the policy arena.",
