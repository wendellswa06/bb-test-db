        "This is TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "I'm Neal Conan in Washington.",
        "President Bush today signed a bill authorizing the placement of a statue of Rosa Parks in the Capitol's Statuary Hall.",
        "Fifty years ago today Parks defied segregation laws of the day and refused to give up her bus seat in Montgomery, Alabama.",
        "Though no laws keep Americans separate today on the basis of race, much of society does remain segregated.",
        "Our guests are Georgetown University law Professor Sheryll Cashin and Howard University Political Science Department Chairman Alvin Thornton.",
        "If you'd like to join us, (800) 989-8255.",
        "Or e-mail us: totn@npr.org.",
        "And let's talk with Carrie.",
        "Carrie is calling us from Detroit, Michigan.",
        "Yes, hello.",
        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "I grew up in metro Detroit, was born and raised there, before I moved out to Boston for seven years, and it was my experience that your first commentator's remarks about the Northeast and the Midwest being the most segregated are absolutely true.",
        "I myself am white, and I actually left Boston to return to Detroit so that I could, you know, re-enter a certain situation where I thought it was very important to be culturally integrated.",
        "However, I find that I'm one of very few of my white educated counterparts who see the city of Detroit as something valuable and worth investing in, and I guess I would like to hear both of your callers' comments a little bit about how in Detroit, which is also one of the poorest cities, which corresponds to some of that socioeconomic and racial distinctions--how do we begin to look at it from the cultural or the emotional perspective, which is the way it's been in Detroit since at least the late '60s?",
        "Sheryll Cashin, why don't you start?",
        "Well, Detroit is an extreme microcosm of a prevailing phenomenon in America, that the fact that America has not yet come to terms with black people when they exist in large numbers.",
        "If you look in places particularly out West where blacks are few, we had double-digit increases in residential integration in the '90s.",
        "But something mystical seems to happen when blacks reach a threshold of 20 percent or more of a metropolitan region, and this is where over half of blacks live in large urban centers.",
        "Detroit is an extreme version of that, and it's a tough nut to crack.",
        "I think that frankly the African-American ghetto, the black ghetto, is at the center of tensions in American race relations; you know, the black poor are the most segregated people in American society.",
        "And these are alternative universes, places where the standard language is Ebonics, where the prison system has a more dominant role in the lives of young black men than the education system, where there are all kinds of alternative behaviors that people adopt that, you know, scare people.",
        "And yet we might all adopt them if we had to live there because it was necessary to our personal survival.",
        "And what goes on in the black ghetto rationalizes fear of black people.",
        "It rationalizes, particularly for white Americans, the chose to flee.",
        "And in fact, in the '90s over half of our cities became majority black or brown.",
        "Whites with children have been fleeing in large numbers.",
        "What do we do about it?",
        "I think we have to begin to consciously break up concentrated poverty.",
        "The black ghetto was an intentional institution.",
        "It reflects intentional choices on the part of the federal government and others to house and warehouse the black poor in certain neighborhoods, and I think we need to begin to think about more intelligent, saner policies that cultivate mixed-income communities where middle class norms can predominate."

        "Alvin Thornton?",
        "Well, I think our discussion is largely, understandably about fiscal proximity or fiscal separateness, and that's clearly what Rose Parks and Martin King and Thurgood and others were addressing.",
        "I think during that day that they were talking about what constitutes American citizenship.",
        "In a minimal sense then, it was this access physically to one's rights to access what one could purchase, including housing and schooling, etc. The early argument I was making was that citizenship should now take on a universal attribute and universal basic right that everybody has a guaranteed right to, and then I think people begin to relate to each other in very, very different ways.",
        "A city like Detroit, while it is as it is now, I think in some future point it will be much like Washington, DC, which people used to describe as this problematic, segregated place for poor black people and now is no longer being viewed in that way.",
        "It's being viewed as a very gentrified place where only rich people can live and poverty is now suburbanized into some of the suburban communities.",
        "So then you see this is a changing thing.",
        "Good.",
        "I wanted to respond to your caller earlier--Kevin from Nashville.",
        "I myself grew up in Memphis.",
        "I went to a predominantly black high school that was 99.9 percent black--well, maybe two or three teachers there at the school.",
        "And that school taught us and it helped us to excel because the teachers there had a genuine feel of who you were and who they wanted you to become and what they saw in you.",
        "Now, to your guest that speaks about the Midwest.",
        "I'm in the Midwest now, and racism is more prevalent for me that I notice in the Midwest than I did the entire time I grew up in the South.",
        "The neighborhood that I live in--it's only one black family, which is mine, in the neighborhood--a high-end neighborhood.",
        "And since we have lived here an entire year, one family has come to speak to us.",
        "That's the first week that we moved in last December.",
        "The job that I work--it's only two blacks on the job, and I have minimal conversation with people at work.",
        "I don't know why I experience that.",
        "Maybe it may be my color or maybe I may be unapproachable.",
        "But I think that--and what my great-grandfather and grandfather taught it--it takes a village to raise a child.",
        "And when we were in our own neighborhoods, you had Miss Catherine, you had Miss Rosemary, you had Mr. Ben Lewis, who ensured that you had those goals, those perspectives and those behaviors where you carried yourself as a dignified person to be treated that way.",
        "And our children do not experience that now in the schools that they are in.",
        "Why is that?",
        "I don't know.",
        "I would venture to say that the main reason they don't experience it is because--I'm assuming that you're an African-American based on what you said.",
        "That's true.",
        "Black and Latino children tend to be in schools that have high levels of poverty, and the kind of community that you talk about, the pre-civil rights, segregated black community was an economically integrated community where the so-called talented 10th was living right there with regular folk.",
        "Black people of all strata were participating in the same institutions, the same schools.",
        "And that's not what we have today.",
        "And part of the reason why I became such an ardent voice for--Dare I say it?--integration, which is not popular with a lot of black folks lately, is that you can have class integration as well as racial integration.",
        "I think we need to be trying to cultivate institutions that are economically mixed and interestingly in gentrifying neighborhoods, there is this possibility for a reconnecting of middle-class blacks with their lower-income brethren.",
        "That's happening in some places.",
        "I grew up and went to one of the apartheid schools in Alabama, and so I'm a little older there, and so I experienced what the young man is talking about in terms of the nurturing and the caring.",
        "And as Professor Cashin said, the place where I grew up was in fact economically integrated though originally segregated based upon an apartheid system.",
        "The one thing that was necessary in order to tear that system down was fundamental structural changes of the society.",
        "It wasn't black people and white people coming to love each other or even wanting to live next to each other.",
        "It was a fundamental, constitutional redefinition.",
        "Who can vote?",
        "Who can join parties?",
        "Who can participate on juries, etc.? And so what I'm suggesting is that we're not going to address the kind of absence of integration--'cause we don't have segregation of the type that we had judicially--is that you're going to have to ask the same structural questions of our nation today.",
        "Martin King and others who fought and who died, if you will, to structurally change America--we must now have people who will ask the same tough questions.",
        "And I believe those tough questions are how you structurally redefine wealth in America, which to me structurally moves away from people of color and lower-income white people, how you redefine questions of access to health and income and education, and those are structural issues that I think are inherently--result in separation in our society based upon the very structure of our society.",
        "It's not going to be any easier now than it was then, and I think if we're looking for people to one day wake up in church or in synagogue or in whatever--in a mosque--on Sunday to say, `We love each other now,' they didn't do it 50 years ago and they're not going to do it now."

        "If I could interject very quickly, I agree largely with what Dr. Thornton has said, but I think a serious structural impediment to more equality along lines of race is our inequality of access to safe, decent, affordable housing.",
        "And I don't think--you can talk about all of these other issues, but unless we're willing to deal frontally with the revolutionary idea that everybody should have a fighting chance at living in a safe, decent, affordable neighborhood, which means that our neighborhoods have to be more mixed along class lines, I don't think we're going to get to a lot of these other issues Dr. Thornton talks about.",
        "One of the things that drove--at least it drove me anyway--in terms of pushing the adequate and equitable education concept in my state of Maryland was that to a large extent the real estate is able to find its definition--that is, high-skilled real estate and low-skilled real estate--based upon the allocation of education.",
        "If you can allocate low-income children into certain communities you can put low-income housing there.",
        "If the state says to real estate people, people who sell and move housing, there's no advantage to your defining real estate in that way because education money both private and public is going to follow the children, that is a large disincentive to segregated, unbalanced housing in our nation.",
        "One of the things that we find, because the Supreme Court said many years ago, that wealth in terms of allocating educational opportunity is not a suspect thing, and states can do that, OK?",
        "That's one of the worst decisions of the Supreme Court it ever said.",
        "If it had said that it is constitutionally suspect to allocate educational opportunities to children based upon race, then some of the real estate interests that my colleague is talking about would have been addressed.",
        "Not all, but some of them would have been addressed.",
        "John, before we let you go...",
        "Yes.",
        "It can't be easy living in that situation you describe.",
        "Well, the White House press secretary did some things to reset.",

        "(Singing, unintelligible).",
        "Well, it's not.",
        "And two years ago, Neal, I formed my own non-profit organization, which--I took multicultured and underrepresented children out of the inner city, partnered with two universities to teach young children of color how to fly aircraft.",
        "And once I did that, everybody was asking, `What are you doing?",
        "Why are you doing that?",
        "And I'm saying, `Why not?",
        "Why not give them an opportunity that they didn't have?",
        "And you couldn't believe how much in 50 years--would have been 49 years--disparity and barriers that I faced at that time.",
        "And I'd say, `Oh, my God.'",

        "There are integrated pockets.",
        "We're not an integrated country, and I can't really point to any countries that truly are.",
        "So what did we agree to do?",
        "We agreed to end desegregation.",
