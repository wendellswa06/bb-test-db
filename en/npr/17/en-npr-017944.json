        "The third and final round of Egypt's legislative elections were marred by violence.",
        "Riot police blocked entry to polling stations and clashed with voters.",
        "One person was killed.",
        "Also, it's been four years after the No Child Left Behind Act went into effect, and in the US, new data show that urban school districts are making little progress in raising test scores.",
        "A study by 11 school districts shows no progress in reducing the achievement gap between white and minority students.",
        "You can hear details on those stories and, of course, much more later today on \"\"All Things Considered\"\" from NPR News.",
        "Tomorrow, it's TALK OF THE NATION/\"\"Science Friday,\"\" and Ira Flatow will be here to talk about stress.",
        "Scientists say that stress can stifle creativity, lower your immune function, even make the flu vaccine less effective.",
        "Can stress ever be good for you?",
        "That's tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION/\"\"Science Friday.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "But, you know, this is all being driven by the Tea Party and the right-wing radios and everything and just getting everyone riled up.",
        "People have to start standing up against this.",
        "I do.",
        "And - yeah.",
        "Today we're talking about segregation and integration 50 years after Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat, prompting a boycott that sparked a movement.",

        "Our guests are Georgetown University law professor and author Sheryll Cashin and Los Angeles civil rights attorney Connie Rice.",
        "And also with us, still on the line, I hope, from San Francisco, Chris.",
        "And just before the break, Chris was talking about how in some neighborhoods it seems to be the movement not towards integration, but towards preservation of that community for the community that has historically lived there.",
        "Connie Rice, is that your experience?",
        "Yes.",
        "You see a lot of that in Los Angeles.",
        "San Francisco, of course, is an interesting example.",
        "They've put African-Americans on the other side of the bay in Oakland, so you've got complete separation there, and very clearly defined neighborhoods.",
        "There are gay neighborhoods, there are Latino neighborhoods, there are Chinese neighborhoods; there are little Japanese enclaves.",
        "So it's very clearly defined racial turf.",
        "And the dynamic is to preserve it, and it's done through a lot of things: real estate policies, just cultural norms and everybody knows where the boundaries are, and you know which kind of neighborhood you're moving into.",
        "I lived in Potrero Hill, which was one of the few mixed areas that you could see downtown, facing--it's south of downtown San Francisco.",
        "So there are a few areas that are integrated, but not many.",
        "And I think what the caller is pointing out is that if you are the racially isolated outsider coming into one of the enclaves, they're going to let you know.",
        "They're--you're going to see it in body language.",
        "You're going to see it in how you're treated in the stores.",
        "It's not open hostility, but you know that you're an outsider and you know that you're--there's not a welcome mat.",

        "She didn't mean to be hostile; she was just reflecting her generation's feeling.",
        "Do you think that integration will come about naturally as time moves on?",
        "Sheryll Cashin?",
        "I don't think it'll come about naturally as long as we have public policies on the books that are premised on the idea of homogeneity rather than inclusion.",
        "In my book I talk about this at length.",
        "It would not be possible for millions of individuals like this woman exercising their individual preference to create the extremely segregated society we have today.",

        "Contrast that to the dawn of the 20th century.",
        "If you look at what cities were like at the dawn of the 20th century, race and class inclusion was the natural state of real estate markets.",
        "So I want to underscore this: For the frustrated person, there's actually more demand for stable, integrated neighborhoods than there are those neighborhoods to fill that demand.",
        "If--for frustrated people out there who would like the possibility of living in a stable, integrated neighborhood with good public schools, I encourage you to find your coalition partners to advocate for more saner policies, like inclusionary zoning.",
        "You know, you can mandate that development, as is--Montgomery County's been doing this for 30 years.",
        "Montgomery County, Maryland, is where you're talking about.",

        "So, you know, I encourage people to have the courage of their convictions if this bothers them and, you know, join coalitions for fairer housing policies.",
        "And I'd like to add to Professor Cashin's public policy point--we actually engineer the kind of inequality and separation that we've been discussing And what I mean by that is--for example, we talked about Detroit a little earlier.",
        "Well, if you take cities like Detroit and Newark, you will see that the actual tax base has been separated.",
        "They no longer share a tax base with the suburbs, the ring suburbs, their inner-ring and their outer-ring suburbs.",
        "And the inner cities have been cut off and have had their school districts gerrymandered and there's no cross-suburban, urban school districting.",

        "And so, simply by drawing a line in a way that separates the urban core from the suburbs, you've actually guaranteed and preordained the kind of hard-core poverty that just--and racial isolation that's very hard to get out of.",
        "Another way that we do it--we talked about Shaker Heights a little earlier.",
        "It's funny; I spent 11th grade in Shaker Heights, and it was mentioned as one of the communities that had integrated in the '50s, and it had, but when you got to Shaker Heights High School, what was so funny about it was that you had 3,000 kids, 1,500 black and 1,500 Jewish and other non-black.",
        "But, Neal, when my brothers and I--and I'm African-American--went--got there, Shaker Heights was extremely high achieving, and they had five levels of college prep.",
        "And when my brothers and I got there, my brothers and I looked at one another and we thought, as every other school that we went to, how quickly would we be put into the lower levels of honors and not at the highest level?",
        "Because we were always put in the non-honors, non-college track, even though we had straight A's from every school we'd ever attended.",
        "And we attended a lot of schools because we were Air Force brats, and I had been to--we had moved 21 times in 22 years.",
        "So we had a game, and we would time how quickly it would take for the white counselor to put us in the non-college track.",
        "And then, of course, my mother would have to come in and we'd be immediately in the AP track, placed there because she demanded it.",
        "Well, we have a lot of people interested in science who listen to us.",
        "Maybe they'll call in or send us some ideas.",
        "Our number is 1-800-989-8255.",
        "You can tweet us @scifri.",
        "We're talking with Michael Nielsen, author of \"\"Reinventing Discovery: The New Era of Networked Science.",

        "The African-American kids, even 35 years ago, did not--there was a socialization that was anti-intellectual.",
        "And my brothers and I were teased and threatened in the bathroom because we were in the AP track with all of the Jewish and white kids.",
        "So you had both dynamics.",
        "You had the institutional racism of assuming that black kids, even with straight A's from schools in London, England, like my brothers and I had, couldn't do Shaker Heights work and, therefore, should be in the lower level honors.",
        "And you also had the cultural dynamic that I think has gotten far more exacerbated.",

        "So I think that what we're seeing today is--the listeners may be a little confused about us talking about this isolation, because culturally and musically and in sports and the younger generations, especially some of the suburban white kids who like to co-opt urban black culture and so forth--they seem to be much more fluid.",

        "It's extremely important.",
        "And we need to honor that legacy and Mother Parks, particularly, for her courage, but we need a new paradigm.",
        "We need a completely new framework, a new language, a new vocabulary and, as Doctor--as Professor Cashin suggests, a very aggressive social engineering-public policy mind-set so that we can say, `Look, if we value'--and why value it?",
