        "Well, they were all measures proposed by Republicans to prevent any of the legalization of unlawful immigrants called for in the bill until the southwestern border with Mexico is effectively sealed off.",
        "As the bill's now written, legalization of immigrants begins once only a plan for securing the border is presented by the secretary of Homeland Security.",
        "And that was unacceptable to Charles Grassley, the judiciary panel's ranking Republican.",
        "If we pass the bill as is, there will be no pressure on the administration or future administrations or even those of us in Congress.",
        "There will be no push by legalization advocates to get that job done.",
        "We need to work together to secure the border first.",
        "People don't trust the enforcement of the law.",
        "Now, Grassley proposed an amendment that would allow legalization of unlawful immigrants to begin only six months after all the southwest border is secured.",
        "That was defeated, but in what was seen as a conciliatory move, the panel did pass another Grassley measure that expands a requirement that 90 percent of illegal border crossers be detained from three high-risk sectors along the southwest border to that entire border.",
        "There are conservatives, David, who indicate that this bill will never get approved unless the border is secure.",
        "Well, those who defend the bill say it does make the border more secured.",
        "It adds $7 billion worth of fencing, aerial drones and Customs agents to the $18 billion a year already being spent.",
        "They also say the real key to stopping illegal immigration is the bill's expansion of the so-called E-Verify program, which will require all employers to check the immigration status of prospective employees against a federal database.",
        "Here's South Carolina Republican and Gang of Eight member Lindsey Graham at the judiciary markup.",
        "The fence, the combination of border security will make it harder to come here illegally, but the key is if you get here, you can't find a job 'cause we finally got a way to control illegal hiring.",
        "And under this bill, you get a chance to find out who's legal and who's not.",
        "And if you hire an illegal immigrant in the future, you're going to get fined heavily, lose your business or may go to jail.",
        "Anything besides border security that could complicate this bill getting passed?",
        "Well, I'd say the biggest problem the bill could run into is if judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy adds his amendment allowing gay Americans to sponsor foreign spouses for green cards.",
        "Even Republicans in the Gang of Eight say they're not ready to back an immigration bill recognizing same-sex marriage.",
        "And Democrats worry such a measure might give Republicans political cover to abandon the bill.",
        "So, they're divided on whether or not to risk that.",

        "Turner liked living dangerously and he liked mavericks, and so when the authorities excluded the independent John Anderson from the Carter-Reagan presidential debate, Turner gave orders that CNN would include him.",
        "What that meant was that after the two principals had responded to a question, CNN would switch to Anderson in Constitution Hall, which we had rented for the purpose, and I would pose the same question to Anderson.",
        "And that meant that CNN coverage would fall behind and require us to go back and forth from tape to Anderson live.",
        "It was a technical mess.",
        "But Turner was proud of it.",
        "I forget how much money Turner lost the first year--but a lot.",
        "Slowly, though, an audience began to grow.",
