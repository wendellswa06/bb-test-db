        "Well, it's funny actually.",
        "That's kind of a - in some ways, it's a bit of a sad story.",

        "One I happen to be very familiar with is a quantum computing wiki, that's my area of research.",
        "And while a lot of people, researchers in the field were very excited by the idea of having the quantum computing wiki - certainly many I spoke to - that didn't necessarily mean they wanted to take the time themselves to go and contribute.",
        "And so you had this funny situation where a lot of people think a resource would be really useful, but they're too busy doing other things - working on their papers and their grants - to want to contribute.",
        "So...",
        "You called it a quiki(ph), right?",

        "No, it didn't get traction, and to be honest, you know, I thought it was actually really well-executed.",
        "So it's not like it failed because it wasn't well-done.",
        "I think it failed because people lacked the motivation to contribute.",

        "Yeah, so, I mean, I should say first of all that it's a terrific thing that they get rewarded.",
        "If you go back to the 17th century, scientists generally weren't rewarded much at all for sharing discoveries, and as a result, they conducted a lot of their research very, very secretively indeed.",
        "So, you know, it's a good thing that we have this modern system, but we would like to change - I would certainly like to see a change to a new system where scientists are rewarded for sharing their ideas more broadly, for sharing data more broadly and for sharing their computer code more broadly.",
        "Now, and getting how to do that, there's a lot of details.",
        "It's a complex question.",

        "Listen, tell me, you're making it sound like a new concept, but isn't this the whole reason the Internet came to be, that it evolved from Arpanet back in the late '60s and early '70s?",
        "You're making it sound like a new thing.",
        "Sure, you're absolutely right, that if you go back to 1970 or so, at that stage, it was really almost a scientific research project, and it gradually grew through the '70s and '80s, mostly in academic institutions.",
        "But I think what we've seen through the 1990s and the 2000s is that in fact the rest of our culture has caught up to the scientists and actually gone really a long way past them, things like the success of Wikipedia or the success of open-source software like Linux really have eclipsed in how they're using these tools the way scientists are using them.",
        "And so there's some catch-up for the scientific community to do at this point.",

        "This fits well, because my point was about - my understanding of scientific discovery, of research and development, is that it's funded by private businesses mostly, and so it's for-profit.",
        "And so if I am a business owner and I am going to be put $10 million into a new way to put stem cells in somebody's eye or, you know, whatever, I'm not going to want to share that with somebody because I'm doing that for my own profit.",
        "And so, you need to have that network of millions of people, as Linux does, who are willing to put in their own time for the common good, and the culture of computer and technology is not the same as the culture of scientists.",
        "And so it's going to take time until that culture of research shifts to the openness of the technology industry.",
        "Yeah, people willing to work for nothing.",
        "So let me come back on - you said that - you started by saying that most research is funded by companies.",
        "But actually, about $100 billion a year is spent of just public money on basic research.",
        "That's a lot of money, obviously.",
        "I mean, it's an absolutely astounding number of dollars to be spending on basic research.",
        "And that money, presumably, is being spent in the public interest, and so I think you can make a pretty good case that publicly funded science should be open science."

        "To some extent I agree with you, there will continue to be a secretive culture within many companies, but there are some big companies - Eli Lilly is one, for example, who are interested in what they call open innovation models, wherein they actually give up some knowledge about their internal processes and their internal problems, and they try and recruit people from outside the company to help attack those problems.",

        "I guess last year, there was a lot of talk about this so-called arsenic life publications.",
        "So some people found that maybe arsenic was being, you know, actually put into the DNA in living organisms, and there was a paper published in Science that got a huge amount of publicity.",
        "And actually, some online bloggers started to look in detail at this, particularly a person named Rosie Redfield, and they started to pull apart the paper with a lot of help from the community and comments from many, many different people.",

        "People can see patterns better than computers.",
        "They can figure out maybe how gene molecules, I'm sorry, not genes, protein molecules fold a little bit better.",
