        "What about this whole equal time question?",
        "We don't have time to get into all the nuances of the law.",
        "But could other candidates demand time as a consequence of Trump being on this program, and has that ever happened before?",
        "For example, when Sharpton was running, did other candidates successfully get time?",
        "Sure.",
        "So basically there's this rule in the Federal Communications Commission that says that individual TV stations have to give equivalent time to opposing candidates when a candidate gets featured the way Trump will be in entertainment programming, not news programming, like a debate or a town hall meeting or something like that.",
        "So what will probably happen is that they will time how long Trump appears, and then someone like Jeb Bush could go to individual stations where there is sufficient campaign activity.",
        "So we're thinking that that would be New Hampshire and Iowa, where the campaigns have kind of concentrated.",
        "It doesn't mean Jeb Bush gets to host \"\"Saturday Night Live.\"\" What it means is those stations in those areas might give him an equivalent amount of time.",
        "We do know that Joe Lieberman, for example, cut a deal to get some time on some stations when he was running against Al Sharpton for the Democratic nomination."

        "And my own feeling, just not based on anything but just my gut and the way the South African government tends to do business, is that there's probably intense discussions going on behind the scenes, but it would take an awful lot to get another African government to be vocally critical of one of its nation states.",
