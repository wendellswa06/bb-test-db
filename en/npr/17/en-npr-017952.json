        "If people choose to get out and actually look and do research on what is said, I think they might learn something instead of just throwing the term McCarthyism around, which they know very little about.",

        "Point I should mention that Peter King's district is on Long Island in New York.",
        "And this from Anne(ph) in Palo Alto: I would have no objection to hearings on homegrown terrorism if they also examine the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, the shootings of abortion doctors or lynchings by the Ku Klux Klan, all done by homegrown terrorists and none having anything to do with Islam.",
        "I'll read another editorial.",
        "This one from former New York City Mayor Ed Koch, a Democrat, who supports the hearings.",

        "Islamic terrorists have made it clear they want to kill Americans - men, women, and children.",
        "If the hearings establish that the American-Muslim community, like the Japanese-American community during World War II, is devoted and loyal to the United States, wouldn't that be of enormous assistance in protecting members of the American-Muslim community from the charges that have been made against them?",

        "From all accounts, what the gruff Long Islander seeks is a show trial, in which American-Muslims will have the opportunity to make, in his words, full-throated, intense denunciations of all terrorist activities.",
        "In other words, he wants them to prove their loyalty to the United States.",
        "To be clear, King does not think all Muslims are a threat to the U.S.",
        "He says he has no doubt that the overwhelming majority of Muslims are good people.",

        "Oh, yeah.",

        "Such unwarranted suspicion may even provoke Americans to hateful action or violence toward their Muslim neighbors as we saw happen in communities in New York and Tennessee last summer.",
        "Instead of targeting Muslim citizens en masse, King should focus on criminal activity and actual threat to our nation's security.",

        "Instead of asking officials in the FBI and DHS whether American-Muslim leaders have been helpful in combating Islamic radicalism and terrorism in the United States, which according to press reports is what King may do, the chairman should query the Bureau and Homeland Security about how knowledgeable their field officers and analysts are.",

        "It's not bigotry to engage in such questioning.",
