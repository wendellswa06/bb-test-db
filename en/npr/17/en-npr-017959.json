        "And what they're seeking to do is create enough doubt or to pose questions that are difficult to answer so you disbelieve what the BBC and other news outlets are saying.",
        "In very recent days, you've also been trying to pinpoint what connections there may have been between British individuals and Russia.",
        "And you've focused of late on a guy named Arron Banks, who - I'll explain for an American audience - British financier, biggest political donor in British history.",

        "What have you found?",
        "Well, what we've found is that Arron Banks was known to have connections with Russia on a personal basis.",
        "His wife is Russian, and that he visited Russia was not a secret.",

        "Yeah, the bells go to let members know prayers have started and that - and then the next bell will go to let people know that the session has started.",

        "Right.",
        "So no secret that Arron Banks has personal ties to Russia, but we also know that he met the Russian ambassador on other occasions as well in meetings that weren't disclosed.",
        "And obviously what for us is of interest is if Arron Banks profited out of his relationship with the Russian embassy in London.",

        "Well, I think there's urgency for all of us because I feel that we're all playing catch-up on this issue as well.",

        "The place that came across as barren and depressing in Lange's photos somehow looks beautiful.",

        "In Adams' vision, Manzanar comes off as a place where Japanese-Americans, dignified and resilient in spite of their circumstances, built a temporary community in the desert.",
        "His purpose was to photograph the residents of Manzanar, to show that they were good, law-abiding Americans.",
        "Kirschner says that both Adams and Lange were trying to depict the injustice of Manzanar, but in different ways - Lange by focusing on its harsh conditions and Adams by focusing on the people forced to live there.",
