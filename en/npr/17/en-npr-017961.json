        "From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.",
        "I'm Robert Siegel.",
        "And I'm Melissa Block.",
        "At the Supreme Court today, the justices heard arguments in a case testing the rights of protesters in public areas, but not just in any public area, what if it's a state highway that happens to cut through a large military installation?",
        "As NPR's Nina Totenberg reports, the justices were not in the mood for big constitutional questions.",
        "Dennis Apel has been protesting at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California for a decade.",
        "The first and only time he did anything other than voice his discontent with U.S.",
        "policy was in 2003 at the beginning of the Iraq War, when he threw some of his own blood on the sign at the gate to the closed part of the base.",
        "He was convicted of a vandalism misdemeanor and the commander of Vandenberg formally barred him from the entirety of the installation.",
        "In 2010, he was convicted of violating that and subsequent orders by protesting in an area that had been designated for protests.",
        "Now, Vandenberg is not what most people think of when they think of a military installation.",
        "Its 22 square miles include public schools, public access roads to beaches, stores that are open to the public, a train station, and most importantly, the installation is intersected by the Pacific Coast Highway.",
        "So part of the dispute in this case is whether, under federal law, the installation includes the closed and open parts of the base, or just the closed part of the base.",
        "About 200 yards from the fenced off and closed part is a painted green line.",
        "Just beyond that is a piece of land that has been designated by the base commander as a protest zone, and just beyond that is the public highway.",
        "And there's been speculation that this could have been some kind of sonic attack.",
        "Other people have said maybe it could have been some kind of crude audio surveillance technology.",
        "How likely is that?",
        "I guess the answer is it's theoretically possible.",
        "But it's hard to imagine the circumstances under which it could have occurred.",
        "So you have weapons that are called sonic cannons, for instance, that fire very loud, very audible sounds, cause pain.",
        "They're mostly used to fend off pirates on the open seas.",
        "But you would know if a weapon like that was used.",
        "And then you have ultrasound, which is sounds that are too high for us to hear them.",
        "And in fact, doctors sometimes use ultrasound to kill bits of brain tissue if they're causing a problem.",
        "But ultrasound is really hard to even get through a patient's skin and bone, let alone through a wall or a window or something where it could hurt somebody.",
        "So another possibility...",
        "Uh-huh (ph).",
        "...Is the other sounds we can't hear, the really low sounds - infrasound, we call it.",
        "It's too low to hear.",
        "And it also can cause physical damage.",
        "But it would take an enormous loudspeaker.",
        "So again, not super stealthy.",
        "So you're saying it's unlikely that it was this sort of sonic attack.",
        "It's unlikely that it was very high or very low sounds.",
        "Is there anything that we can learn by looking more closely at the symptoms that people have experienced?",
        "Well, one of the problems with concussion is that it is diagnosed by the symptoms.",
        "So if you're dizzy and you have - you know you got hit on the head, then the doctor says, oh, you had a concussion.",
        "You can do MRI scans of people, which I understand was done on many of the people from Cuba, but MRI does not show most concussions.",
        "There is one very sophisticated type of MRI called diffusion tensor MRI which can show problems, subtle problems in the white matter of the brain.",
        "These are the information highways.",
        "But it's unclear whether that's been done on anybody from Cuba or, even if it was done, whether it would show this kind of problem."

        "So what are the other possibilities here that might have caused this?",
        "I mean, vague symptoms like these can be caused by all kinds of things.",
        "It could be an infection.",
        "It could be antibiotics which are known to cause hearing loss, brain disease.",
        "Or it could even be poison.",
        "So there are all these other alternative physical explanations.",
        "And then there is also the psychological explanation, which is something called mass psychogenic illness.",
        "And that is when symptoms spread through a group even though there is really no physical cause for them.",
        "Does psychogenic mean it's all in your head, or is it real?",
        "It's real to the people who experience it.",
        "The symptoms feel just like they would if they had a physical cause, but they don't.",
        "A real mystery, I guess, still unsolved.",
        "Still unsolved.",

        "The hospice movement is a fairly recent development.",
        "It's been just 40 years since the first modern hospice, St. Christopher's, opened in a suburb of London.",
        "Since then, millions of people around the world have used hospice care whether it was in their homes, hospitals or special hospice centers."
