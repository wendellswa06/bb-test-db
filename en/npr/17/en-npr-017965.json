        "It's called the Inner Space Center, and it's sort of like Houston is to outer space, we have for inner space, and we are operating our vehicle 24 hours a day, and what they see is being beamed back to this Inner Space Center.",
        "And then from there, using this new, wonderful Internet2, this new high-bandwidth Internet that's sweeping the country right now, we're connecting all of the oceanographic institutions to the Inner Space Center so that we can actually bring a scientist aboard the ship, take him down to the bottom of the ocean in a matter of seconds.",

        "That's the idea.",

        "You know, a hospital has no idea what an ambulance is going to bring in Sunday morning at 2:00 a.m., so they have what's called the doctors on call.",
        "They have physicians that can respond to a hospital within 20 minutes if they're needed.",
        "So we're setting up this 20 minute response by connecting the oceanographic institutions, which can move at the speed of light through the Internet2.",
        "We're building remote consoles so that we can literally call someone up.",
        "Imagine, call them up 2:00 a.m. Sunday morning, wake them up.",
