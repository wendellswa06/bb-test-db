        "They'll decide, you know, if they - if we discovered something that wasn't that important.",
        "You know, they'll say take an aspirin and call me in the morning, but if it's really important, they'll jump out of bed, they'll get in their car, and they have to be within 20 minutes of one of these remote consoles, and while they're in their car they're going to be calling their friends and their graduate students, because they need to take over the ship for the next couple days.",
        "So they'll need five or six other scientists, and then they'll all run to their consoles, and they'll all be patched in, and then they'll all take over.",
        "It's really cool.",
        "And so what area will you be looking at, and what will you be looking for?",
        "Well, in the Pacific, we had a big get-together at National Geographic - who have been really helpful in all of this.",
        "We had a workshop, working with NOAA, and we brought in experts that have passion for the Pacific.",
        "About 40 different groups of scientists submitted white papers and said, you know, if you're ever in the Pacific, and you want to discover something, go here, and so we got this map of the Pacific, and it's got boxes all over it, and then what we're going to do is we're going to move around from box to box, but then we're going to wander along the way.",
        "We call it the box-and-stick strategy.",
        "I think most of the exciting discoveries will be done between boxes, as we're navigating our way from A to B, and so we have that plan.",
        "They're now developing a schedule for the Okeanos, and it'll begin really in earnest in May.",

        "Well, so which part of the Pacific do you look in?",

        "They're going to work their way to the Indian Ocean, I mean, to the - excuse me.",
        "They're going to start in Seattle.",
        "They're going to work towards the Hawaiian Islands.",
        "They're going to explore that entire seamount chain.",
        "Then they're going to end up - by May of next year they'll be in Indonesia, in the Western regions of the Pacific, and then they'll work their way back.",
        "While they're doing that, our ship the Nautilus, will start its campaign actually next month.",

        "If you know your geography, if you up though the Aegean and you go though the Dardanelles and that's where the Helspont is, where the Persian armies crossed on their way to battle the Greeks.",
        "This is also where the Germans and the Turks fought the British in the Battle of Gallipoli in World War I.",

        "We're working off of the Crimea, which is - there used to be ancient Greek colonies there.",
        "One in particular called (unintelligible).",
        "And just off of that ancient Greek colony the bottom of the ocean plunges down to 6000 feet.",
        "And the water there is poisonous, it's completely anoxic.",
        "It's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on Earth and there we expect to find the most perfectly preserved ancient shipwrecks in the world.",
        "Because there's no oxygen there.",
        "Exactly.",
        "There's no one to eat anything.",
        "In fact, we have already found a beautifully preserved Byzantine shipwreck on the other side of the Black Sea, off the Turkish coast at a place called Sinope.",
        "And we found in 15,000 feet of water, we came in with our robots and there was a ship's mast with rigging on it.",
        "And we dropped down 40 feet and there was this ancient ship perfectly preserved.",
        "Do you raise these ships, go and bring these up?",
        "Well, it has been done.",
        "I mean, certainly in typical marine archeological programs they try to recover everything.",
        "That's not our strategy.",
        "Our strategy is actually to build underwater museums in place.",
        "And about - not only around the ship off Turkey but we also found a Byzantine shipwreck off the Crimea and we're building underwater museums.",
        "And the reason for that is very simple.",
        "A lot of these ships had a lot of the same thing.",
        "They're sort of bulk carriers, like stopping a truck on the I-95 and it's got a thousand of these things and a thousand of those things.",
        "We really don't want all of that stuff.",
        "We just need a representative sample.",
        "So, what we're doing is we're actually storing everything down there because it's happy down there.",
        "It's equilibrated and we don't want to go through the expensive process of conservation and preservation.",

        "And you'll sit, probably spherical, so it isn't square-like walls but you'll be in a spherical room and you'll rent a robot from Hertz and you'll go for a drive in the Serengeti and spend the afternoon driving around.",

        "What's really neat about these installation of remote cameras, we've been doing it in the National Marine Sanctuaries, particularly Monterrey.",

        "And what we found was when we were installing the cameras, everyone ran away.",
