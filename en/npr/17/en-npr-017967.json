        "And fortunately, when I went to University of California at Santa Barbara I had a quadruple major in math, physics, chemistry and geology.",
        "So, I have a broad based background.",
        "And I feel comfortable in a lot of different things and I certainly feel comfortable working with engineers.",
        "And most recently I began working with social scientists because I always actually loved history as a kid.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…thinking that my passion for history would be just something that would, you know, fall by the way side as I went into the physical sciences and got my doctorate in oceanography.",
        "But through this re-invention and through the creation of this new field, which is very exciting new endeavor, archaeological oceanography, which is taking oceanographers, engineers and social scientists and going into the deep oceans where we think there's probably more history in the deep sea…",
        "Hmm."

        "We've seen, for example, dolphins down there that have died a natural death and they're on the bottom, and they look like they're asleep.",
