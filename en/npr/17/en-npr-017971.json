        "The House Speaker said job creation in America is facing a triple threat.",
        "One, excessive regulation; two, a tax code that discourages investment; and three, a spending binge in Washington that has created a debt crisis.",
        "Now, to be sure, Republicans have always been against over-regulation, spending and taxing in bad times and in good.",
        "The difference today is that Boehner is directly blaming them for the economic problems working Americans face today.",
        "Job creators in America basically are on strike and the problem is not confusion about the policies.",

        "And at times, during his speech, Boehner even seemed to strike a conciliatory tone.",
        "The responsibility for fixing this toxic environment for job creation is a bipartisan one.",
        "But listen closer and the speech starts to sound more partisan.",
        "Its decidedly Republican view of the problem leads Boehner to a decidedly Republican solution.",
        "The situation was created by Washington's inability to let our economy work.",
        "It was created by government intrusion and micromanagement.",
        "And I think we've got a responsibility to work together in the coming months to remove these barriers and to liberate our economy.",
        "Liberate the economy, said Boehner, from the shackles of government.",
        "It's a slogan that delivers on two fronts.",

        "I think being undocumented, you don't really get to celebrate a lot in your lifetime, but we need a strong policy that protects people under DACA but that's not going to hinder the rest of the community.",
        "And so by that, she means that they don't want a deal that would, let's say, implement the E-Verify system, which requires employers to check the legal status of people they hire.",
        "To the DREAMers, that's just another way of increasing the threat of deportation to their undocumented parents.",
