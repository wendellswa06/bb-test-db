        "When we talked to her last year, the house was safe, but flooding had swamped 80 percent of their land.",
        "Today, as many nearby towns are marking the flood's one year anniversary, we called Karen to see how her farm and her community are doing one year on.",
        "She says it took about a month just to get one field dry enough to plant.",

        "law enforcement and intelligence officials in Yemen now working on this case.",
        "They do have some information about who mailed these packages based on tracking numbers, return addresses.",
        "But Yemeni authorities are also saying - cautiously - that documents have probably been forged, so I think it's way too soon to say that they are on track to find out who was responsible.",
        "What more do you know about the bombs themselves and the intended targets?",
        "U.S.",
        "officials are not ready to say that.",
        "The one thing they will not talk about here is what kind of trigger mechanism was in these bombs, in these packages.",
        "We know they were addressed to synagogues in Chicago.",
        "But if the idea was to for them to explode at those synagogues, they would have, again, had to be some kind of device to explode it when it opened up.",
        "We just don't know what the trigger mechanism was here, therefore we can't say what the idea was, what the target was.",
        "How was this attack avoided?",
        "I mean, it sounds like a very successful interception of what could have been a deadly attack.",
        "But we know there was a tip from Saudi intelligence officials that these bombs were there and coming, and that was how they tracked it down."

        "Scott Horsley just reminded us of the controversy surrounding her.",
        "Is this selection more or less a finger in the eye of Republicans?",
        "Well, Republican reaction has been mixed.",
        "Senators like Bob Corker, who's the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, along with Kelly Ayotte, and Lindsey Graham and John McCain - all of who opposed Rice and that opposition led to her withdrawing her name from consideration as a successor for Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of State - today, all of them said they would put their differences with her aside and work with her.",
        "Rand Paul, on the other hand, said that he couldn't imagine promoting Susan Rice.",
        "He said she misled the public about the Benghazi attacks.",
        "But the most important point here is, as Scott just pointed out, as the national security advisor, she does not need confirmation by the Senate.",
        "Meanwhile, of course, Samantha Power does need to be confirmed by the Senate.",
        "So how do you think she'll be received?",
        "White House officials say they do not expect any big problems, in the end, getting Power confirmed.",
        "However, that doesn't mean that her hearings are going to go smoothly.",
        "Republicans may see her as a surrogate for Susan Rice and for Hillary Clinton, and question her aggressively about the Obama administration's foreign policy controversies, particularly Benghazi, although Power had no involvement in that issue."
