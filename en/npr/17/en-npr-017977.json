        "Catching the right behavior at the right time is absolutely critical, as you write about in your book, Amy.",
        "Right.",
        "And you know, people are always asking me how, I mean, aren't we a lot more complicated than animals, and we are and all that.",
        "But we are also a very distracted animal - distracted species.",
        "And so we tend to let - when people are doing things we like, go right past us without noticing them and because of that, people don't always know what they - what people want from them but they also get the feeling taken for granted.",
        "So what this really - the thinking like an animal trainer really helped me sort of notice those moments and not be so distracted.",
        "...A Cincinnati label.",
        "Great.",
        "Hey, I have a question or a comment.",
        "I've always thought that we teach other people how we want to be treated, and so does that apply in this sense in your book - I haven't read your book - so I think it goes both ways.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think, I mean, this is just about basically teaching people what you want them to do or what you want from them.",
        "But the sort of twist is, is that teaching them this way through focusing and rewarding the things that you like.",
        "And as much as you can, ignoring what you don't like.",
        "Usually, us higher primates tend to really teach people what we don't want by heaping lots of attention on that instead of really focusing on what do we want.",
        "Well, the example you use in your book is your husband tends to have a short temper when he loses his keys or his wallet, which he does frequently.",
        "Yes.",

        "And it wasn't that he lost his keys that bothered me that much, it was that he lost his temper over his keys, and I would always engage in this search either by being helpful or sometimes I would lose my cool and tell him that, you know, to calm down, that never works, unfortunately.",
        "But the point was is that I was always engaging.",
        "And when I started thinking like an, you know, progressive animal trainer, I realized that I was heaping tons of attention on a behavior I didn't like, which was my husband losing his temper, so I cut it out and quit responding and it improved dramatically.",
        "Quit responding.",
        "You just stood there at the sink and continued doing the dishes while he went storming through the house looking for the keys.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And he - so he still lost his temper a little bit but it was really fast moving, and he found his keys much faster than if I had had helped.",
        "Isn't that the truth.",
        "I know.",
        "And I really thought to myself like, oh, my god, I've wasted the last 10 years of my life helping my husband find his keys.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "It demanded a lot of patience and self-control, and so what I didn't realize is that is I did that in these sort individual interactions that it would have a sort of overriding some result and that I would in general become a more patient person with more self-control.",
