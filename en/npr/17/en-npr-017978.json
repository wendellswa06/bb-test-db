        "When he was younger, we used applied-behavior analysis, the formal version of the shamu author's methods, to dramatically improve his behaviors and capabilities.",
        "Many critics of this method suggest that using it dehumanizes the child and creates a little robot.",
        "Our experience is that our son has been empowered with myriad communication and social skills that have helped him live a more dignified life.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's - I'm really glad she wrote that because what people don't understand is that this - the human psychology version of this, like the animal training version of it, is a means of communication.",
        "It's communication.",
        "It's not making people into robots.",
        "Well, that other phrase that bothers people sometimes is behavior modification.",
        "Right.",
        "And that got a really, you know - we could have another show about how that happened but it is - the early science has been developed a lot further along and the - people have a misperception that there was punishment involved but the real - the way to use this is with rewards.",

        "Hi there.",

        "Having had discussions with a lot of educators and spent some time in the classroom myself, this struck me as something very typical for high school students.",
        "And that all too often, teachers don't realize that if their students aren't understanding, maybe they need to try something different.",
        "Aha.",
        "That's a great point.",
        "I mean, my impression is that -especially - there's a lot of people who are using these ideas in their life and not realizing that it has a corollary in the animal kingdom, but especially teachers, I find, use these techniques.",
        "And what you brought out is - really, brought up is a really good point because one of the things I really like about the way the trainers worked is they know everything about their animal and they know the species, but they also know the individual.",
        "And so they applied these principles not as a cookie cutter but is always in response to the individual they're working with.",
        "So that really sort of brought home to me that, you know, to think that way about people in my personal life, too.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Sarah.",
        "The other point you raise in the book is, well, who is teaching who.",
        "Right.",
        "In this partnership, you know, it goes back to, I guess, a query that a lot of, you know, has been thought, did mankind cultivate wheat or did wheat cultivate mankind.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Right.",
        "It's an interaction between two different species."

        "I have.",
        "I mean, when the article came out, one of - I got invited almost immediately to speak to a very large convention of psychologists.",

        "But they're - you know, the animal trainers, the thing I think that animal training sort of brings to it is that they have the animals in the equation, sort of brings out the magic of it.",

        "David with us from Idaho.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "I was wondering, \"\"Beyond Freedom and Dignity,\"\" that was Skinner's book, as I remember, and did not they find out that this sort of behavior modification required a lot of reinforcement?",

        "Well, the - you know, I'm not sure I can totally answer that, but I know in the world of animal training, what they do is work what they call a scheduled variable reinforcement.",
        "I think intermittent reinforcement…",
        "Right.",
        "It's another way to put it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "…it's called in Skinner's book.",
        "And what it is, is that - and they find that that's actually a very powerful way to maintain a behavior, and that's that you get reinforcement just often enough that the behavior still feels rewarded but not in a regular kind of way so it keeps up sort of person or animal or whatever sort of guessing or hungry for when it's going to have that.",
        "So without the reinforcement, it doesn't last, is that correct?",
