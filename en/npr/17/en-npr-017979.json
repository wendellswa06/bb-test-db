        "Well, the way the animal trainers would think about it is that you correct behavior - you don't correct behavior, you encourage the behavior you want, so you really turn it 180 degrees around.",
        "So if somebody is doing something you don't want, I guess, it's what you what you try to think of is what it is you do want them to do and how you might encourage them that way.",
        "And one of the techniques in your book that I found really intriguing was this idea of, well, basically, distracting them.",
        "Right.",
        "Give them something that is incompatible with their (unintelligible) you do, incompatible with their bad behavior.",
        "Yeah, I really liked that.",
        "That's, I think, is a really brilliant idea that the animal trainers came up with.",
        "And that is an incompatible behavior is you get them to do something that makes the other behavior impossible.",
        "Now, for example, in the book, you're talking about a killer whale and if the killer whale is called over to present a pectoral fin at the pool side, the killer whale can't be busy pestering the other killer whales.",
        "Right.",
        "And so instead of stopping him from bothering the other whales in the pool, they are having him do a calming exercise that makes that impossible.",
        "And he's getting fish for that.",
        "He's getting a reward for that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And at the same time with your husband, who used to crowd you when you were cooking, you came up with another approach.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So my husband used to crowd me all the time and no matter how many times I barked and snarled at him and huffed and puffed, he would always - he'd back off but then come back right up and crowd me at the stove again.",
        "So I came up with an incompatible behavior with him and that is to, basically, set out something he want because the incompatible behavior has to be something the person or animal wants.",
        "Mm-hmm."

        "He can't do that…",
        "He can't do both.",

        "Yes, just like that killer whale.",
