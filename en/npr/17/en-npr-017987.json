        "So could the US be, in effect, training forces that will eventually become sectarian militias?",
        "There's always a possibility that that will happen.",
        "We're trying to avoid that as hard as we can, particularly with the regular Iraqi army battalions that we're recruiting.",
        "There is really an effort to make sure that there is a mix of Shia, Kurd and Sunni people to make the unit as diverse as possible.",
        "The problem you run into there is it is an all-volunteer force.",
        "So they have to take what shows up.",
        "And it's generally a majority of Shia right now.",
        "They really have to work hard to try to make that unit a little bit more diverse.",
        "You know, one of the other things General Vine's talked a good bit about was the need for better infrastructure, that right now the defense and interior ministries just aren't able to provide even basics like water and ammunition.",
        "Why is that such a problem?",
        "Well, the problem is you've got a lot of people who right now are doing this for the first time.",
        "By and large, most of the people who are running the new security services and so forth were on the outside during the Saddam regime, so they don't have a lot of experience with logistics.",

        "Well, it's a challenge.",
        "The problem with that entire region, and we saw it in Lebanon in the '70s, is that there is an old-boy network, a tendency to promote people due to their connections, and you just can't have a competent democratic army without some degree of meritocracy.",
        "So it's going to be something that we really have to help them with if we expect this democratic concept of civilian control of the military to take hold.",
        "There have been some complaints from Iraq's Ministry of Defense that they're not getting the appropriate military equipment that they need from the US.",
        "For example, instead of tanks, they're getting pickup trucks.",
        "Is there some reluctance to build too strong of an Iraqi force that eventually will not be under US control anymore?",
        "Well, you know, that's a concern, and really the original concept was really to have a force that wasn't very strong, kind of on the model of the German army or the Japanese army after World War II.",
        "And it was specifically designed not to take part in internal security.",
        "That was before we realized how bad a problem we would have with the insurgency.",
        "So by the time they made a policy decision, we'd lost about a year in preparing an army that was properly trained to do what it's doing right now.",
        "It's a mistake and it's going to take us awhile to recover from it, quite frankly.",

        "Shortly thereafter, Ceballos was denied a promotion and transferred to a remote location.",
        "He sued, contending he'd been punished for exercising his First Amendment right.",
        "Today, lawyer Cindy Lee, representing the county, argued that if the court upholds a right to sue in a situation like this, public agencies would drown in claims from their employees.",
