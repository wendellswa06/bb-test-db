        "In fact, in the short run, costs could go up.",
        "Insurance companies will have to cover more right away but the requirement that people buy insurance doesnt take effect 'til 2014.",
        "Karen Ignagni, who heads an industry trade group, warns between now and then, more people may drop their insurance, leaving a smaller pool of policyholders to pay for expanded coverage.",
        "The policy goal is correct, and that is to give people more health security.",
        "It's very difficult to accomplish without having everyone participate if you don't expect that the costs are going to go up.",
        "Anti-tax watchdog Ryan Ellis warns there are other immediate effects that the president didn't talk about in his Ohio speech.",
        "Ellis, who's with the group Americans for Tax Reform, says the overhaul would quickly impose multibillion-dollar levies on drug makers, medical device makers and the insurance industry itself.",
        "Look, there's short-term benefits that the president is talking about, that he has every right to talk about from this bill.",
        "But if he's going to be honest, he needs to also talk about the short-term costs.",
        "There's taxes that kick in right away.",
        "And there's even more taxes that kick in after a very few years.",
        "Those later taxes would take effect between 2013 and 2018, primarily affecting the nation's wealthiest families and people with so-called Cadillac health insurance.",
        "Democrats say they're confident they can win the political argument if voters consider both the costs and the benefits of the health-care bill.",
        "They'll have an easier time, though, if some of the benefits are in effect when voters go to the polls.",

        "The Consumer Electronics Show is the convention where technology companies show off their shiny new toys.",
        "It starts tomorrow in Las Vegas.",

        "NPR's Laura Sydell is in Las Vegas to cover the show with her 3-D glasses.",
        "At the ready, Laura, I imagine a lot of this show will be devoted to these fancy new TV sets.",
        "They will.",
        "And I have had a chance to look at some of them, and the 3-D itself is kind of extraordinary.",
        "It feels like you're being surrounded in a room by a bunch of fictional characters.",
        "It has this kind of amazing feel.",
        "But sets themselves don't look terribly different.",
        "The thing that's different, of course, is that you mostly have to wear those funny glasses in order to see 3-D because the way the whole thing works is that one eye sees something slightly different from the other and the glasses bring it together.",
        "And you get the illusion of being in a three-dimensional world.",
        "There is possibly one set that will come out made by 3M where you don't have to have the glasses.",
        "The problem with that one is that it actually means you have to sit in a certain position in order to see it.",
        "And if somebody were to invest in 3-D TV how much would it cost them?",
        "You know, initially, it could set them back as much as $2,000 for a television, for I guess a larger 42-inch screen.",
        "Part of the question here is with regard to the cost is that people just bought HDTVs.",
        "So, one wonders if people really want to go out and buy another television set after you've just been told you needed to buy an HDTV.",
        "But that's the initial cost.",
        "And probably the people who would be likely to buy it are the kind of people who are going to be first adopters, you know, they want to be the first on their block to have one.",
        "You would also want to be sure if you were going to make that investment that there would be something you'd want to watch.",
        "What about content in 3-D?",
        "Well, content is coming.",
        "I think that a lot of the networks were pretty excited about the success of \"\"Avatar,\"\" the 3-D movie that came out and now I guess it's been about a billion at the box office.",
        "So, ESPN, starting in June, will broadcast the World Cup in 3-D.",
        "Also another venture was just announced that included Sony and IMAX and Discovery and they say they are going to launch and entire channel dedicated to 3-D.",
        "But that won't come out until sometime in 2011.",
        "So, that's down the line.",
        "Right now, all you're really going to be able to watch is ESPN.",
        "Laura, you and I talked a couple of days ago about the buzz over tablet computers said to be unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show.",

        "Well, the other thing that I've seen and it's the big buzz here is mobile TV.",
        "So, you could get TV on your cell phone.",
        "So, last time I saw a Samsung phone, it had a little antenna, and you could watch the local news, you could get network television on it.",
        "And this is something was - that was made possible when everybody transferred over to digital television."

        "A lot has been made of the default, the possibility of defaulting.",
        "What has been the global market reaction to where we are now, and what you think that reaction is likely to be: A, if we do default; and B, if we don't default?",
        "And it's important to point out that if we do default, which is a giant if, it likely wouldn't be a default on our interest payments on treasuries.",
        "This wouldn't be a default to our creditors.",
        "It would be sort of a default to ourselves, at least initially, and that would be less of a concern to the international community.",

        "What's the story with it?",
        "Is it a real deadline or not a real deadline?",
        "Well, the Treasury secretary will certainly have us believe that it is a real deadline, that they will begin having to make very hard choices if that threshold is passed.",

        "So to come back to you, Ron Elving, given what Tamara has just described as this sort of amorphous deadline for tomorrow, how is that impacting what is taking place at the moment on the Hill?",
        "I would say, not to be cynical, but I would say that another deadline that's affecting the people on the Hill is the fact that their recess is supposed to begin this weekend.",
        "And it is probably not entirely an accident that when the Treasury secretary said some months ago that they could move an account here and move an account there and jimmy things around long enough to keep issuing checks and honoring those checks on the United States Treasury until August 2, he was choosing the Tuesday on the last week that Congress was expecting to be in town.",
        "He knew perfectly well that there was going to need to be some kind of deadline and incentive for Congress to take the bitter pill that we are only now beginning to taste that is this proposed deal.",
