        "It sounds like when we kept - the president kept coming out and saying we needed to compromise, to share the burden for revenue, which would be tax increases.",
        "But in this deal, it's my understanding that there is no revenue and that the trigger that should take place to motivate Congress to actually put something together bipartisan, everyone that mentions it keeps saying tax reform, as opposed to revenue.",
        "And I'm wondering are we really talking about a shared burden with this, or are we actually just talking about cutting some subsidies?",
        "John, that's a very good question.",
        "Ron, what about that?",
        "The cuts that are contemplated by this deal are split basically equally between defense spending and non-defense spending.",
        "So one of the sacred cows that's very much on the altar in this deal is the idea that you do not cut into essential defense spending no matter what.",
        "When we go back to when the fascination with the debt really became an obsession in Washington in the 1980s, at that time we were in a big buildup for the military, and the military spending went up every year, even as efforts were being made to in some sense or another cut back the size of the federal government.",
        "So this is something that we've been living with for a generation, and one of the things that's rather eye-opening about this deal is that the spending cuts are going to be divided between defense and non-defense.",
        "At the same time, the balance that the president was talking about, and the caller is absolutely right, the president kept talking about more revenue.",
        "Whether that's a tax increase or whether you talk about closing a loophole or eliminating a tax expenditure, it all adds up to more money coming into the Treasury, and that we don't have in this deal.",
        "Some people read the deal to open the door down the road to a deal in a super-committee that is going to be appointed, of 12 members of Congress, that could include some increases in revenue down the road.",
        "But there's nothing in this plan that commits anyone to that.",
        "Now, the issue of cuts in defense spending is one that Senator John McCain has said gives him pause with respect to the bill that's currently being considered.",
        "As with the first caller, we just got an email from someone asking again the same question about military spending: Do we know - I don't believe I heard this in your answer - do we know to what extent military cuts are built into this?",
        "Yes, in the very first phase of these cuts, the government is committing itself to spend less, almost half-a-trillion dollars less, on the military over the next decade.",
        "Now, this is not an immediate cut in the sense of people who are currently in uniform being sent home.",
        "This is not an immediate cut in terms of taking away some of the benefits that veterans enjoy or the people in the military today enjoy.",
        "Limited as those are, those are not the kind of cuts we're anticipating here.",
        "What's going to be cut, one suspects from looking at this and anticipating what Congress and the Pentagon will do in reaction, is that long-term contracts for additional military equipment - and we're talking big things here, aircraft carriers, aircraft systems, things of that nature - are either going to be cancelled or greatly cut back."

        "Hi, yes, that was exactly my question.",

        "Thank you very much for the call.",
        "What about that?",
        "The president who, after all was a constitutional law scholar at the University of Chicago Law School for a time and is not unfamiliar with the Constitution, has gathered around him a number of people he considers experts on this question and asked is this a viable option, is this something I could actually do.",
        "And of course, you know, Bill Clinton was in some kind of tough spots when he was president, as well, in terms of very similar issues of debt and deficit spending and so on.",
        "And he tried to prevail using such means as well, we'll have a partial government shutdown and veto a bill and so forth.",
        "But he didn't try to, you know, stretch the powers of the president into an area that's never been used and a strong interpretation, let us put it that way, of what was meant by the 14th Amendment way back in the Civil War era.",

        "Well, what this plan calls for is cuts in government spending, and cuts in government spending, economists tell me, will in fact likely slow the growth of the economy.",
        "They don't have exact figures at this point, and really it's all pseudo-science anyway - economists, don't call - but what they're saying is that it could lead to slower economic growth, and also that means fewer jobs created.",
        "And just to give you a sense of where you are, the economy is not growing very quickly right now.",
        "We just learned that in the second quarter, the economy, GDP grew at a rate of 1.3 percent, and we had a revision downward for the first quarter to just four-tenths of a percent.",
