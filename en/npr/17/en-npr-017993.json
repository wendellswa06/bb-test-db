        "Exactly.",
        "Let's talk about, again Ron Elving, what's occurring on the Hill.",
        "There is said to be in this bill a two-part process, the second part involving the creation of this committee.",
        "Tell us, if we get to that point, what that committee would consist of, who puts the people on that committee, and what are they supposed to do, and by when are they supposed to do it.",
        "Yes, if this deal gets approved this week by House and Senate and signed by the president, then there will be a committee appointed.",
        "That committee is going to have a rather heavy responsibility.",
        "There will be 12 people on it.",
        "They will be members of Congress.",
        "They'll be appointed three by the Republican leader of the Senate, three by the Republican leader of the House, similar number of Democrats from House and Senate.",
        "And this even-Steven, six-and-six, two-party, two-chamber committee is going to have to decide how to make another $1.5 trillion in cuts to add to the $900 billion in cuts we've already committed to if we pass this thing this week.",
        "And they are going to have to do that or else.",
        "The or else, then, by the end of this year, is that if they haven't come up with something that the two chambers can pass, then we will have sequestration, which is a kind of an automatic, across-the-board percentage cut across everything, with very few things held harmless, although some things will be held harmless.",
        "There will be another round of cuts affecting all the other discretionary funds, all the other forms of domestic spending.",
        "So the presumption is that by putting this group together, even if they can't come together in a bipartisan way, this trigger, which is at their heads, so to speak, will force them to take action that to this point Congress has been unable and unwilling to do.",
        "That's right.",
        "If you've been watching, you know how well and how easily these two parties and these two chambers cooperate: They don't.",
        "So they're asking themselves one more time let's try to do it with this new super-committee.",
        "We're going to control them, and then they're going to bring something back to us to vote on House and Senate.",
        "And if it doesn't fly, if we can't accept their product, then there will be these automatic, across-the-board cuts.",
        "Let's put this in a historical perspective, if we can, Ron.",
        "I know you're the right person to do that because many people have been asking how did we get here, and who are these people that put us in this predicament that we are in, and has this happened before in the history of governance in this country?",
        "Well, the debt ceiling was created as part of the World War I borrowing to pay for World War I, 1917.",
        "All the years since then, we have had this debt ceiling.",
        "And we have frequently, scores of times, hit the debt ceiling and had to raise it."

        "It's usually done as part of the regular housekeeping and budget business of the Congress, and most of us never have to pay any attention.",
        "For many years, they just did it automatically as part of the budget process.",
        "But people who feel that the government has gotten too big and spends too much money and are very upset about the deficit, which I think everyone is upset about, but they are particularly upset about it from the spending side, these people have chosen to make this particular raising of the debt ceiling a kind of donnybrook to say we've got to have a confrontation over this.",
        "As long as we raise the debt ceiling, we keep spending money.",
        "So if we don't trust the Congress to close this budget gap, and if we don't trust the Congress to come up with good budget cuts, let's just not raise the debt ceiling anymore.",
        "That's why we have this.",
        "But why now?",
        "Why right now?",
        "Because the debt ceiling has come around again.",
        "The gap between the money that comes in and the money that goes out has forced enough more - enough additional borrowing.",
        "I mean, this deficit, this debt that we've had, it was $1 trillion in 1980.",
        "It tripled to $3 trillion by 1990.",
        "It doubled again to $6 trillion.",
        "Then it doubled again to $12 trillion.",
        "And in the last two and a half years under President Obama, it's grown from 12 to 14, so those last 2 trillion are on his administration.",
        "The previous 12 trillion were on all the previous administrations, mostly the administrations from 1980 to 2010.",

        "Or what's going to happen there?",

        "We won't get in there if we don't pay people their debt service.",
