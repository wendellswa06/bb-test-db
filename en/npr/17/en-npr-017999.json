        "Certainly, it's an important state but they say it's a lot more important for Senator Clinton.",
        "They say it is a 50-state strategy that they're running, and there are nine contests that will really help decide this thing once Pennsylvania is completed.",

        "And now these stories have been out there, of course, Michele, and one of the questions the campaign has had to answer is, look, these stories about Reverend Wright and some of the other stories have been out there, and yet Senator Obama continues to pick up all of these superdelegates.",
        "So, you know, are these negative stories having a real impact, but before a night that the Clinton campaign says that they feel like it was good for them.",

        "Russia's also involved in the conflicts in Syria, and that's also considered a possible motive behind the attack.",
