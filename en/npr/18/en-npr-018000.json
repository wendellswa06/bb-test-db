        "I walked up that street, too, to get out of the house, to the movie theater uptown, to one of those early Clint Eastwood movies or Alfred Hitchcock's \"\"The Birds.\"\" I didn't see in the early '60s quite how my town would be affected by the world beyond and how we would affect it.",
        "In a brief span, as I hit my teens, Faulkner died, James Meredith desegregated the University of Mississippi and the Freedom Riders Goodman, Cheney and Schwerner were murdered in Philadelphia, Mississippi, some 150 miles away."
