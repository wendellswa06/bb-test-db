        "We'll remember she was the Justice Department adviser, the White House liaison, who together with Alberto Gonzales's deputy, Kyle Sampson, were cooking up this list, apparently without any supervision at all.",
        "Well, now the Justice Department is launching an inquiry into whether maybe Goodling improperly used the politics or the ideology of candidates as a litmus test in hiring prospective prosecutors.",
        "And that would be in violation of the law.",
        "It raises all sorts of big, big questions about the grant of immunity that she was supposed to be given in exchange for her testimony before the Judiciary Committee.",
        "So it's a really interesting problem of - if she's in fact broken some laws, can this testimony go forward?",

        "Well, free trade does bring jobs to America.",
        "And what was really interesting in his speech, which, by the way, had (inaudible) footnotes - the written version of it - which might be a personal record for Donald Trump - the source of a lot of his numbers on the free trade section of the speech came from an organization called the Economic Policy Institute, which was a think tank or is a think tank that was founded by labor unions to promote the labor unions' point of view on free trade agreements.",

        "Is that something you heard today in his tax cuts, for instance?",

        "He's against immigration.",
        "But he has been in favor of tax reform, and he has been afraid of - in favor of developing American energy sources like through fracking or hydraulic fracturing.",
        "The tax reform plan in particular was an area where there seems to be some movement from where Mr. Trump was several months ago.",
        "Right.",
        "His original plan would have increased the debt by $10 trillion according to many experts, right?",
        "Correct.",
        "And the - he's now said that he wants to have a plan that's more harmonized with what House Republicans under speaker Paul Ryan have proposed.",
        "That plan has been scored by independent analysts as only increasing the deficit $191 billion dollars over 10 years and accretive to the debt and the deficit over time.",
        "So a much more fiscally responsible plan is what House Republicans have proposed.",
        "And while Trump said, well, our plan won't be exactly like the House Republican plan, the closer it is to that plan, the less likely it is to increase the deficit.",
        "And do you believe him that this version of Trump, this policy vision is something that could stick?",
        "Well, you know, I take him at his word in terms of that his policy thinking on tax reform has evolved because I think he recognizes that a plan that would increase the deficit by $10 trillion over a decade is not a plan that's likely to get traction in Congress.",
        "Having said that, it's far from clear in general that Donald Trump is a guy who really thinks about the details of policy and is going to do the kind of heavy lifting you have to do as president to get those policies through in Congress.",
        "I think the hope is that Paul Ryan and his crew will push policies through Congress and Trump will just sign them.",

        "That rhetoric about Muslims, he said, wouldn't be his policy to ban Muslims, but Cruz didn't say much else.",

        "So while Cruz has avoided attacking Trump publicly, Trump has been criticizing him on the campaign trail.",
        "He called Cruz a maniac recently, said he doesn't have the temperament to be president.",
