        "If your card is sitting in a drawer for a week, then it's not going to generate any numbers until you come back and press a button and get one as you need it.",
        "Well, then how would the matching number back home know what my number is?",
        "And how would it validate that selection if it depends on when I press the button on a credit card?",
        "The way, as I understand the technology, the backend server is going to recognize a certain number of valid pass codes during a particular period of time.",
        "The way the circuit is made, it's going to generate numbers based on the time that you press it.",
        "For it to properly work with a backend server, it has to have a way to be able to recognize the time that it's being pressed and for the server on the other end to also recognize a valid pass code that could come through at that particular time.",
