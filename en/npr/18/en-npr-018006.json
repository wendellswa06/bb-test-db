        "I think you point out it was Aristotle who first arrived at the age of 21.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He had this idea that you had three seven-year stages of maturation in childhood.",
        "And when you're done with the three sets of seven and you're 21, then you're an adult.",

        "And these seem pretty arbitrary reasons.",
        "And I think some of the brain scientists that we'll talk about would say 21 is probably not the optimum age.",
        "But since then, in, you know, recent decades, 18 has become more the age of adulthood for most things in this country.",
        "We had the 26th Amendment in 1972 giving 18-year-olds the right to vote, a lot of different responsibilities went to 18, including drinking in a lot of states.",
        "And…",
        "Well, that seems…",
        "…since then, we've found that 18 was not a good age to have people drinking, when they could also be driving.",

        "Hi.",

        "But immediately following that, I had a few wrecks because of my inexperience driving.",
        "And since then, I have thought that I think 16 is a little too young for you driving and maybe the age should be moved to 18, which I know most high schoolers would disagree with me, but…",

        "…with the result of my wreck and my friend's many speeding tickets, I feel that that would be more appropriate age to start driving.",

        "In Michigan, there's a - I live in Michigan, just across the border from Canada.",
        "It's only about 45 minutes by car.",
        "And the drinking age in Canada is 19, as opposed to being 21 in Michigan.",
        "And so there's a big tradition in the area of on everyone's 19th birthday, their friends get together, take them to Canada and everybody starts buying them drinks.",
        "And there's a huge culture in the area, especially among college students, of going into Canada for good times.",
        "There are the Windsor Casinos.",
        "But what I found from my own personal experiences in dealing with people is that the people that are drinking at 19 -begin to start realizing that there's more to life than that, that there's more to do than that.",
        "And once the - it becomes a difficult thing to obtain, while legal, it sort of loses its luster quickly.",
        "And by the time they're 21, their drinking days are behind them and they just sort of move on and have a beer casually with other people.",
        "Alan Greenblatt, you write about this a lot in your article, specifically about a proposal by some college and university presidents to lower the drinking age to hopefully get more students past the binge drinking that we see so much of on campus.",
        "You got it, okay.",
        "So you got some nuts, right?",
        "We're using what kind...",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "That's their argument, that everybody is drinking anyway, and because it's illegal, it's kind of a fugitive thing and they can't control it.",
        "And the problem with this argument, I think, is - and by the way, they want to have a kind of individual-competence-testing model where they can find out when people are ready to drink.",
        "I'm not sure what the test would be, whether it would be two drinks or more.",
        "But anyway, I think the danger of it is that, again, you know, the other caller was talking about driving.",
        "You don't want people making their driving mistakes the same time they're making their drinking mistakes.",
        "You want to kind of separate some of these ages, I think, just as a practical consideration.",
        "And one of the reasons - the reason states raised the age to 21 is that Congress passed a law saying if you didn't raise the age to 21, you would lost 10 percent of your highway funds.",
        "So all 50 states made 21 the drinking age.",
        "But one of the considerations was that, as the caller says, people were going to other jurisdictions.",
        "They were driving to the next state, where the drinking age was lower, getting drunk, driving back, getting into crashes.",
        "It was a real problem.",
        "But sort of the underlying issue for all of these things is the question of how much responsibility to give people, how much rights to allow them.",
        "We deny teenagers things we would not deny to adults, but there is this public safety and health component.",
        "We want to protect young people from the harm they can do themselves to others, and there's a real tough balancing act of helping them reach an age of responsibility, but in a way that is best for public safety.",
        "And it seems to me that the driving is where states have done the best.",
        "The caller from Oklahoma City, Shannon, was saying she had a lot of wrecks at 16.",
        "And the insurance people will tell you the most dangerous time for a new driver is when they are a new driver, when they - the first six months after they get their license.",
        "It's very - they're very cocky, and it's a really risky time, and there are lots and lots of accidents.",
        "And almost every state, every state but North Dakota has put in something called graduated driver's licensing, which is basically a provisional license.",

        "That's definitely something that's a significant reason for consideration.",
