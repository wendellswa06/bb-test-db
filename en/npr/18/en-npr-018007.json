        "Yet, as I understand it, the prefrontal cortex is the area that changes the most as we're in our late adolescence, up till the age of 25.",
        "And that's the area of the brain that's thought to govern things like, well, decision-making and impulse control.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "We know that the parts of the brain that mature, the systems of the brain that mature are those parts that are active when we engage in planning, thinking ahead, foresight and impulse control.",
        "And it's not just the prefrontal cortex.",
        "It also involves the connections between the prefrontal cortex and other parts of the brain.",
        "So clearly, the parts of the brain that are responsible for decision-making are maturing during this time, but the more difficult question is asking when is somebody mature enough.",
        "And that can, as they say in many cases, vary with individuals.",
        "It does vary within individuals, and I think that one of the problems we encounter there is that we don't have the time or resources to test everybody.",
        "I mean, imagine what the line would look like at the multiplex if we had to test everybody to see what their maturity was before deciding whether to let them in for R-rated movies.",
        "So we have to draw boundaries based on chronological age, if only because it's the only practical thing to do.",
        "And from what you've seen, have those arbitrary decisions that we've made in the past, based on whatever reasons we've had for various things, that 18 is the right age to allow people to vote, 16 to drive, 21 to drink alcohol?",
        "Do those seem wise?",
        "Well, they certainly don't seem to have any scientific basis for them.",
        "I mean, generally speaking, we use 18 as the presumptive age of adulthood, and then we tweak that number depending upon what the consequences might be for teenagers and society.",
        "So, for example, we use a lower age for driving because we think that there may be some benefits of allowing adolescents to get to their jobs, as one of the callers indicated before.",
        "But yet we use a higher age when it comes to drinking because we don't see any benefits to letting adolescents drink.",
        "So I don't think that there is a right age, and I don't even think that's it's necessary that we have one age that applies to everything.",
        "I wanted to get back to Alan Greenblatt, who writes for Governing Magazine.",
        "Obviously, people who write laws and enforce them are reading these brain-science stories, too.",

        "And professor Steinberg can talk about this better than I can, but I think it's beginning to have an impact in the juvenile-justice arena, the question of whether it really makes sense, as we've done over the last 30 years, to make it easier and easier to try kids well before they're 18 as adults, put them in adult facilities.",
        "I don't think it's convinced anyone for the reasons the professor states, that it - you can't make a link between what a brain looks like at 25 versus 16 and say, well, this is going to affect behavior.",
        "But it's a way of opening a door to think about whether kids are really at a different stage, even if they're committing horrible crimes, whether they're more rehabitable than an adult would be.",
        "Laurence Steinberg?",
        "Well, I think the reason that the research has attracted a lot of attention to people interested in juvenile and criminal justice is that there's an example where the age at which we treat people like adults is so out of synch with what we know about brain development and what we know about behavioral development that it just calls into question the whole logic of doing things like trying 12-year-olds or 13-year-olds as adults.",
        "So I don't think that the brain science is going to be very important in arguments about whether the drinking age should be 20 or 21, or even 18 or 21.",
        "But I do think it has been important, as Alan says, in starting a conversation about whether the way we've organized the juvenile and criminal justice systems makes sense.",

        "But because I'm not 25, I can't rent for any reasonable price for even those companies that do rent to 21 to 24-year-olds, and I'm much less inclined to do that if I'm going to have to jump through all these hoops, anyway.",

        "Alan Greenblatt, as far as I understand it, she's right.",
        "This is not a governmental regulation or law of any sort.",

        "Well, that's right.",
        "It's an actuarial question.",
        "They're private companies, and they've made a decision that the risk of renting to people before they're 25 outweighs the benefits of having a few good customers like Brianna.",
        "And that was something I tried to toy with in the article was the question of whether the car rental companies were right, whether 25 was the age of responsibility.",
        "And it just - again, it's not a practical thing.",

        "Is that right, Laurence Steinberg?",
        "Well, a little bit, but certainly, I think what the research would say is that by the time we get to the age range that we're talking about here, sex differences are quite small.",
        "So it is true that in early adolescence, you see girls as more mature psychologically than boys, but by late adolescence, there aren't really large differences."

        "In recent years, though, they've found is that the arbitrary lines sometimes don't work in practice, that it makes sense to all of us that 13-year-olds shouldn't be having sex and 14-year-old and 15-year-olds, but they found that they were jailing people who weren't much older than that.",

        "Well, it's a very good question and I think the short answer is no. We - in our group, we have studied people as old as 30 and we see increasing maturity from, let's say, 20 onto 30, certainly before 20.",
