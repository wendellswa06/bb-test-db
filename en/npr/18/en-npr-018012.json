        "Who will tell the president?",
        "Well, the majority of film makers in Nigeria are basically doing these things to survive.",
        "And you know the dark age of the military regime in my country sort of set things back.",
        "The film makers couldn't afford to move forward, so an alternative solution was created, you know, to get your camera out, shoot something in it, we have to survive.",
        "But now it's changing gradually.",
        "People are beginning - professionals, you know, trained film makers are coming in, they're coming back to the business again and they're trying to revive the industry.",
        "How do you handle the distribution, and how are people able to actually see the work that you produce?",
        "Well, in Nigeria, at least we have a very good distribution network in Nigeria for local consumers.",
        "So the - generally, the marketers have outlets scattered all over the country.",
        "So once a movie's released, they get their distributor and he gets to the, you know, consumers.",
        "Jamie, what's the purpose of the documentary that you did about Nigerian film making besides to expose it to the rest of the world that may not know what's taking place there?",
        "I think for me, the film is also about showing a different side of Africa at large.",
        "Because I think in the U.S., as consumers of media, we don't really get a fair picture of what's going on in Africa, of the complexity of African countries and people.",
        "And so I thought this kind of a film that focuses on a very positive part of African life, and something that Nigerian directors and film makers and producers, you know, creating this industry on their own, you know, have created something without any outside support or anything like that.",
        "That kind of story, again, that inspirational kind of story, for me felt very different than any other stories I'd seen being represented in our media about Africa.",
        "And to me, that was kind of an important point that I wanted to get across.",
        "Izu, just a couple of more things.",
        "How difficult is it to do some of the more complicated kinds of crash scenes and explosions and things, fires, and all that stuff that you see in action films?",
        "In the documentary, they showed how, you know, you guys put the blood in the water when they had the war scene and stuff.",
        "How hard is it to get those things that Hollywood is now generating via computer?",
        "It is difficult, you know.",
        "This is like in the movie I shot while Jamie was in Nigeria, it took me seven months to get the attention of the Nigerian army.",
        "The first time they were giving that kind of support to an independent film maker - to any film maker at all.",
        "So I saved and then, you know, was constantly visiting the army headquarters until the army chief of staff, you know, approved this process.",
        "And I had bomb engineers, you know, on set.",
        "So I mean it's the first time anything like that is happening in Nigeria.",
        "So it indicates that the future is bright for the Nigerian movie industry.",
        "Jamie, you want to add anything to that?",
        "What you've seen in comparing films made in Nollywood versus those you've seen made in Hollywood?"

        "You know, there's all kinds of films being made in Nigeria - political thrillers and action movies - and so it's a really interesting industry to me in terms of, you know, continually defining itself and redefining itself.",
        "It's also very responsive to the news cycle.",
        "I mean, think about it.",
        "In the U.S., we can't be as responsive to our news cycle because it takes several years to make a film.",
        "But in Nigeria, if you can make a film in a month or six weeks and get it out, you can be really responsive to what's happening in the news media.",
        "So there was a lot of talk about those kinds of films, whether to reflect political reality or some sort of social reality.",

        "It came as a bit of a surprise.",
        "Well, a surprise only because he said from the beginning - from all along - that he would not only not drop out - although he has not won anywhere - but he will continue straight to the convention.",
        "He has 56 delegates so far.",
        "He said the name of the game is acquiring delegates, and he hopes to pick up delegates here and there on the 22 - 23 states that are voting on Super Tuesday."
