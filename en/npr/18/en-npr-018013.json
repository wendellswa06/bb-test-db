        "We took about - only twice in history, has a United States senator, a sitting senator, ever been elected president - Warren Harding in 1920 and John Kennedy in 1960.",
        "And it's a lock this time.",
        "Well, we don't know if John McCain is a lock, but certainly, it would be among John McCain, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama - the likelihood of a senator being elected president.",
        "We always talk about governors.",
        "It could be a senator this time.",
        "And Erin, if an Obama-Edwards ticket is something that you're looking forward to, at least John Edwards doesn't have a job right now.",
        "So he might be looking for work.",
        "Oh, that's golden.",
        "That is golden to me.",
        "Now, how about Cabinet appointments for any of the other, like, earlier…",
        "I think it's probably a little premature to think about Cabinet.",
        "Well, it's not - because we've already announced that Bill Clinton as secretary of state, secretary of defense, United Nations ambassador and attorney general…"

        "I mean, I don't know what's more remarkable.",
        "The fact that Rudy Giuliani was the national frontrunner for the longest time, and he collapsed so quickly in the minds of the voters, or the fact that John McCain, who is left - written off for dead is now perhaps the Republican heir apparent.",
        "The Lazarus act.",
        "And in the meantime, you look at that election in Florida, this was a Republican primary, a closed primary.",
        "Only Republicans could vote, only registered Republicans could vote.",
        "Even so, John McCain managed to win in that primary election without winning the majority of the conservatives.",
        "Right.",
        "But let me say one thing about the Independents.",
        "One reason that a lot of people thought that Mitt Romney was going to win Florida is that, unlike New Hampshire, unlike South Carolina, John McCain had Independents crossing over for him in those states.",
        "And they helped propel him to victory.",
        "Only Republicans could vote in the Florida primary, and yet McCain won anyway.",
        "So it's very interesting.",
        "But he still has the battle, you know, to go ahead among Republican conservatives with Mitt Romney.",
        "Now perhaps with Rudy Giuliani getting out of the race, as we expected at 6 p.m. Eastern time today, there will be one person who might - I suspected Giuliani took away from McCain is both seen as kind of moderate wing of the party unlike the Romney-Huckabee wing of the party, which is more conservative."

        "So, perhaps Giuliani dropping out helps McCain.",
