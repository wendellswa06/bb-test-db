        "Bridget with us from Louisville in Kentucky.",
        "Yes.",
        "I was curious to know listening to MSNBC and CNN, they are now talking that Hillary Clinton will take the votes that once were supporters of John Edwards.",
        "And I am amazed that they think just because people are white middle-class Americans that they will flock towards Hillary Clinton for this.",
        "What do you think, Bill Carrick?",
        "You know, I think, there are two theories here.",
        "One is what the caller mentioned, which is of course, the idea that came out of the South Carolina primary that the white votes got split between Edwards and Clinton and Obama, and that enabled Obama to win with a very large majority of African-American voters.",
        "You know, the other theory, I think, is that there's a built-in anti-Clinton vote created by the fact that she's a frontrunner, the most established candidate, that Senator Edwards himself articulated during the caucus night in Iowa, changed one when he finished second to Senator Obama's first.",
        "So, I think, there's another theory that goes, well, you know, there's a lot of anti-Clinton voters out there.",
        "They were attracted to two candidates.",
        "Now -maybe they're going to coalesce behind one candidate - Barack Obama.",
        "Bridget, I did see one estimate today that suggested 40 percent would go to Obama, 25 percent for Clinton.",
        "You'll note that that doesn't add up to a hundred - the rest being undecided thus far.",
        "But I wonder, Bill Carrick, do you think it matters where those voters may be.",
        "I mean if - this might have, you know, one effect in Georgia and another in California.",
        "I think that's absolutely right.",
        "I think if you - you know, Georgia is very similar demographically to South Carolina, and Senator Edwards was probably was going to pull a lot of rural white voters to his candidacy -had a very populous message that resonates very well with rural white voters in the Democratic Party.",
        "Now, those voters - you might can make a case they go to Senator Clinton.",
        "On the other hand, I think the caller is right.",
        "I think that, you know, everybody has presumed something in his campaign has end up being wrong.",
        "In the California case, Senator Edwards' basic constituency here - with service employees, the food and commercial workers, a lot of the change to win unions - were very, very dedicated to his candidacy.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Service employees are the largest union in California, and the most - one of the most politically influential by far and very sophisticated politically.",
        "They are now are for grabs with less than a week to go before the primary, which makes for a very interesting dynamic."

        "And I can only hope that Clinton and Obama will continue to be talking about poor people, because nobody else has in a very long time.",
        "I have - I had a question about John McCain and his health.",
        "We're not just hearing anything anymore about whether he's still healthy.",
        "It was so up and down there for a while.",
        "But now with - the service workers in California, are they Mexican-Americans?",
        "What is the cultural make-up of the service workers?",
        "That's an interesting thing to think about it, I think?",
        "Bill Carrick.",
        "Well, they are largely - they have heavy components of both Latino members and African-American members.",
        "And they are - the Latino community in California is very closely aligned in many ways with the labor movement, as well as the African-American community.",
        "And they have an enormous influence, and they're used to running very strongly organized campaigns here.",
        "They do a very good job, and they could be very influential if they weigh in before next Tuesday."

        "And also when you think of Iowa 2004, all the big union supporters went to Howard Dean and Richard Gephardt, and they finished third and fourth.",
        "So there's a possibility that we may be overstating the potency of the union vote.",

        "Now it may not be the people that the losing candidate want seated, and we've seen this in - you know, in credential spites in the past.",
        "1972, which I can remember, is a big case in point where there was a dispute about the California delegation with who was going to be seated.",
        "And the McGovern people actually controlled the votes of the convention to that point, and they were able to seat a largely McGovern delegation.",
        "The same convention that did not seat Mayor Daly, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so you're going to see potential if it's a very, very close convention, and there's some possibility that they're going to see a big fight over who - which Florida delegation gets seated.",

        "All the senators' endorsements of Mr. Obama are very impressive, but what does that do to his changed image with so many of Washington's politicians endorsing him?",

        "Obviously, a reference to Senator Kennedy earlier this week, though, he is among many.",
        "Well, that's - let me think for a second - that's a very interesting question.",
        "But at the same time, many of these endorsements are coming from red-state Democrats - Kathleen Sebelius in Kansas; Ben Nelson, the senator from Nebraska; Governor Janet Napolitano - and Napolitano in Arizona.",
        "While, of course, it's hard to be an outsider and get many established Democratic endorsements, but at the same time I think it's interesting that many of these endorsements are coming from red-state Democrats.",
        "And Bill Carrick.",
        "You know, having the endorsement of Ben Nelson and Ted Kennedy may be a first in Democratic Party history, and the early endorsements of both of them in relative terms.",
        "I think the interesting thing - one of the interesting things about exit polls yesterday in Florida is 49 percent of the Florida Democratic voters thought Senator Kennedy's endorsement was important.",
        "That's an extremely high number for an endorsement in any context.",
        "And of the voters they thought it was very important - that was 26 percent of the total electorate of them.",
        "Barack Obama got 59 percent of the vote.",
        "So Senator Kennedy's endorsement may indeed actually be pretty powerful.",
        "Particularly, he campaigned in the places where he's popular - in the Latino community, obviously in Massachusetts and Connecticut.",

        "I don't know if I'd go quite as far as saying a clear road, but it became pretty clear over the last week or so that whoever won Florida was going to become a very strong frontrunner for the nomination.",
        "Obviously, it's the biggest state that voted so far.",
        "It's the first time McCain's won a plurality of Republican votes.",
        "Of course, he won South Carolina and New Hampshire on the strength and support from independent voters.",
        "And I think as important as his win in Florida was Giuliani's very disappointing finish, because I think it's worth assuming that almost every single Giuliani vote will now shift to McCain.",
        "And Giuliani's absence from the race coupled with his likely endorsement in a few hours, I think, gives McCain a huge leg up going into the Super Tuesday states.",
        "And he has not got a lot of money, however.",
        "How does he compete in, what, 21 states the Republicans are competing in?",
        "Well, that's his most difficult challenge, and that's one of two great advantages that Romney still maintains.",
        "There's an open question, though, given Romney's spending habits in the past, how much he'll spend in these states.",
        "I mean, Romney is rich, but he's not Michael Bloomberg, Oprah Winfrey-rich, and buying statewide, weeklong advertising in California and New York and 19 other states is a lot of money.",
        "So Romney is going to have more money, but I don't think it's going to be a prohibitive advantage.",
        "And no question McCain gets a huge news media bump and jolted momentum that could at least match, if not trump that.",
        "Probably worth pointing out that Romney ran ads roughly 10 to one ahead of McCain in Florida and still lost by, what, five points.",
        "So…",
        "Oh, Romney's people will argue, I think, with some credibility -we'll see how much in a week - that in advertising, a spending advantage like that isn't as significant when both candidates are on the ground nonstop for seven days.",
        "Clearly because of the breadth of the Super Tuesday - primaries next Tuesday, both McCain and Romney are going to be hopscotching all over the country.",
        "It's not going to be the same kind of intense voter-to-voter contact in any of the February 5th states that McCain was able to achieve in Florida.",
        "We're talking with Republican strategist Dan Schnur and with political junkie Ken Rudin.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "So is this a two-person race?",
        "Are Huckabee and, well, the other person is Ron Paul who is still in the race?",
        "Well, let's set aside Ron Paul just for the moment in the conversation, and I guess I would say it's not a two-person race but rather it's two-and-a-half person race.",
        "It's - until noon today, there were two front-running candidates - McCain and Romney, of course - and two second-tier candidates, Giuliani and Huckabee.",
        "And as I said a moment ago - you can make a pretty good bet that just about every Giuliani vote will now shift to McCain, and you can make an equally strong assumption, I think, that virtually every Huckabee supporter - or Huckabee not in the race - would then shift to Romney.",
        "So all of a sudden, you have two frontrunners instead of both of them having albatrosses on their back.",
        "McCain's albatross is not only gone but endorsing him, and I think Romney's greatest disadvantage next week is going to be that 10 to 12 percent of the conservative vote that he loses to Huckabee…",
