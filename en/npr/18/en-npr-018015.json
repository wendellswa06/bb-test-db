        "Well, that's exactly right.",
        "And Huckabee doesn't have to win or even finish second or even a close third to dramatically undermine Romney's chances because you've - aside from the more basic centrist conservatives split in the party, you still got these pretty hardcore of McCain haters.",
        "And to the extent that Huckabee takes some of those out of Romney's column, that's a problem for Romney and an advantage for McCain.",
        "And there's certainly no love lost between Huckabee and Romney.",
        "Romney spent a lot of time calling Huckabee a liberal, so I don't think that Huckabee feels like he's in any hurry to do any - Romney any favors by pulling out of the race.",
        "Well, Huckabee, Thompson, Giuliani, and of course, McCain, none of them have a particularly great deal of love for Mitt Romney.",
        "And it looks like Giuliani is endorsing McCain with a particular amount of relish, and I suspect that Fred Thompson will weigh in for McCain when he and McCain decide it will do the most good for them and the most damage for Romney.",
        "So…",
        "Which raises - leaves the question: How does John McCain make up to those McCain haters, a lot of them the conservatives in the Republican Party?",
        "Well, as long as Mike Huckabee's around, it's slightly more achievable because all those voters are not consolidating behind one single candidate.",
        "That's a huge advantage for him.",
        "What he does is what he's, you know, been doing for the last several weeks, and he's been making inroads and making progress.",
        "He talks a lot of national security.",
        "As the debate has shifted the economy, he has repeated the phrase foot soldier in the Reagan revolution one million times in the last three weeks.",
        "And he does his best to stay away from issues like campaign finance reform, like global warming and most importantly like immigration.",
        "They've really caused some problems with the base.",
        "If I can just add very quickly here, that while this is a - McCain isn't in a very strong position right now, I think the other advantage that Romney has with him is - if he chooses to use it - is the immigration issue.",
        "In California, Republican voters here ranked not the economy, not national security, but immigration as the issue of most - important to them.",
        "And while McCain took a huge amount of grief from voters and from talk show hosts last summer, Romney really hasn't gone at him on that issue in a sustained way.",
        "I suspect if Romney is going to get back into this race in tonight's debate, you're going to hear the word amnesty over and over and over again.",
        "And if he doesn't say it, Rush Limbaugh will probably will.",
        "Dan Schnur, thank you very much."
