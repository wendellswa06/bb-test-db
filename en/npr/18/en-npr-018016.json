        "Yes, the week before in Michigan.",
        "Oh, really?",
        "Yes.",
        "Oh, yeah, that's true.",
        "And I was wondering whether the - whether you guys felt that the fact that that contest was for - delegates impacted whether it - the win was worth any momentum.",
        "In other words, going into Super Tuesday, are people going to perceive Hillary Clinton as having gained momentum from that win, or is it going to be kind of null since she didn't win any delegates there?",
        "Let me just also point out the Republicans punished the Republican Florida Party as well.",
        "They got half the delegates they would have gotten ordinarily."

        "The 57 delegates that the Republicans were up for grabs in Florida yesterday was half of what they should have gotten, exactly.",

        "Well, she could.",
        "I mean, she certainly won big.",
        "She won basically in two states where they were not campaigning.",
        "I think the argument - the Obama argument - is that in states where he does campaign, he does certainly far better than states where if you just leave it to the polls like Hillary Clinton has been the nominal frontrunner for the longest time.",
        "If you look in California, I think the latest polls I saw is she's up by 12 points, and we still have a week to go before Super Tuesday.",
        "But if Obama campaigns there, if there's a lot of activity there, obviously, that could narrow.",
        "But she does have - look, she does claim it as a victory.",
        "Obviously, she's a nominee.",
        "She's going to insist that Michigan and Florida delegates be seated.",
        "I think, historically, one thing I always think of is 1964, when the all-white Mississippi Democratic Party was challenged by the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, which is a biracial coalition.",
        "I believe they lost at the time.",
        "But again, it was the first serious attempt I saw at a delegation being thrown out.",
        "And just - we're sure was an oversight, Hillary Clinton did win a contest that was contested, of course, in New Hampshire.",
        "Oh, that's correct.",

        "And of course, if the Evangelicals were so upset with him, they had the opportunity to throw him out of office in 1996, and he won an easy re-election.",
        "But there are - a large segment and, as you know, and I've talked to a lot of people, Democrats who say they just cannot vote for Hillary Clinton.",
        "But she has plenty of time to change minds.",
        "I mean, there were some people who just, you know, like the fellow from…",

        "The more you see these candidates, the more you have an opportunity to change.",
        "And so the good news for us political junkies is there's plenty of time to go before a nominee is going to be named."
