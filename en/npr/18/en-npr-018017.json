        "And I would like to say that I hope people realize that you don't have to vote for Obama or Clinton, and that Mike Gravel is for the people, and he wants to enact the national initiative where people vote for laws, and corporate censorship just stopped him.",
        "And he wants to stop the big corporations from taking over the American people.",
        "And I think that people should look at Mike Gravel more closely.",

        "Oh, well, I wanted to emphatically agree with Tyler in that I got to many more people who'd never vote for a Clinton than folks who'd never vote for a black guy.",
        "So that's the first thing I wanted to say.",
        "And the second thing was that I'm a Chicago Obama supporter who is one of the 13,000 volunteers who went down to South Carolina last weekend.",
        "And I think that Obama's success was in large part due to grassroots support.",
        "In fact, there is one volunteer for every 23 voters, I think, doing get-out-to-vote activities.",
        "So, 75,000 volunteers are now poised to help Obama on Tuesday.",
        "But what I'd like to know is if you think it's possible for a candidate to successfully run a grassroots campaign in 22 states at once."

        "Isn't that a big deal on these big primary days, Ken?",

        "And you can go into people's living rooms and talk about issues.",
        "Unfortunately, with the way Super Tuesday is arranged, it really disenfranchises 90 percent of the electorate because nobody sees the candidates up close.",
        "And by that, what you're doing really is just watching TV ads and, again, watching the spin on the 6 o'clock news.",

        "You don't know what's going to come out of that, too.",
        "And it'll be very interesting to see what comes with the Democrats, too, without John Edwards, one on one.",
        "You know, there's no third candidate to take some of the heat away from the two frontrunners.",

        "It's a special kind of horror to be delayed for, let's say, even half an hour or even five minutes, for that matter, in a subway car that's stalled that has no electricity that's well underneath the ground and the air is stifling.",
        "And that - just the fear of that happening is enough to drive people away, isn't it?",
        "Well, certainly, like the - we talked about California, which, of course, has the most delegates, and certainly on the Republican side as well, Democratic side.",

        "It's proportional.",
        "You get X amount of percentage in the state or congressional delegate district.",

        "So theoretically, with John - with Rudy Giuliani out of the race and perhaps expecting to endorse John McCain, McCain could win New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.",
