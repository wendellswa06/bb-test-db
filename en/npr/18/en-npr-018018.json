        "It was very exciting.",
        "And it was such a great opportunity for me to not just live here but also give back to this country.",
        "But nearly two years after enlisting, Harminder Saini and John Sena are still waiting to ship out to basic training.",
        "That's because the Pentagon has frozen MAVNI while deciding its future.",
        "Citing security concerns, the Pentagon ordered intensive background checks on all current MAVNI service members and recruits - about 10,000 of them.",
        "Such a massive backlog of security checks leaves about 350 DACA recruits in limbo.",
        "In the meantime, if they lose their DACA status, they become ineligible for the Army.",
        "Margaret Stock is a retired Army lieutenant colonel who created the MAVNI program back in 2008.",
        "And they're now going to face deportation, even though they signed enlistment contracts and have been waiting patiently all this time and going through all the background checks that were necessary for them to ship out.",
        "President Trump plans to start phasing out the DACA program in March unless Congress steps in.",
        "Sena's DACA status expires in October of next year.",
        "Saini's status ends a few months later.",
        "The possibility of getting shortchanged by two government programs leaves Harminder Saini almost speechless.",

        "It's just - it's very, very frustrating.",
        "Sena and Saini have powerful allies.",
        "Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates says that DACA recipients should be allowed to serve and become citizens.",
        "Even the current secretary of defense, James Mattis, says he would like to preserve the Pentagon program for immigrants.",
        "Pentagon officials note that the Army is struggling to meet its recruiting goals.",
        "Richard Gonzales, NPR News.",
        "Kurds in northern Iraq voted overwhelmingly this week in favor of splitting from Iraq and forming an independent country.",
        "They say it's a chance to escape a history of mistreatment from the central government.",
        "Baghdad and surrounding countries opposed the move, and they warned about retaliation.",
        "Now it seems like they're making good on that.",
        "And for more on this, we're joined by NPR's Jane Arraf, who's in Irbil in northern Iraq now.",
        "Hi, Jane",
        "Hi, Ailsa.",
        "What signs of retaliation are you seeing from Iraq's government already?",
        "Well, I was at the airport, and the airport is a really big deal because the Iraqi government has threatened and seems to be willing to follow through on stopping all international flights starting tomorrow evening.",
        "So ahead of this deadline, there are people in the airport rushing to get on those flights.",
        "I talked to one Lebanese guy who said that his bosses were sending the entire company out.",

        "Well, majority of the Supreme Court justices says that the rationale the Trump administration said for wanting to add this question - to better enforce part of the Voting Rights Act - that rationale - they called it - said it seemed to be contrived.",
        "And he said that there's a disconnect between the decision to add this question, a question that Census Bureau research suggests is highly likely to discourage households from participating - noncitizen households from participating in the headcount and produce less accurate citizenship data than existing government records - there's a disconnect between adding that question and wanting to have more detailed citizenship data.",
        "The president doesn't just want to try again with the court, right?",
        "He wants to delay the census.",
        "Is that even possible?",
        "I mean, can the census be delayed?",
        "The census is constitutionally mandated, and federal law says that it has to happen every 10 years.",
        "A count has to been taken around April 1 every 10 years, and there's a set schedule for the Census Bureau to provide a population count - a new population count.",
        "Eventually, that goes to the redistribution of congressional seats the year after a census is taken.",
        "So that would disrupt the formation of new government.",
        "There's another deadline that President Trump may be referring to, which is - there's this printing deadline.",
        "The Census Bureau has said that the forms for the 2020 census - the start - starting - excuse me - starting to print that - those forms has to start by Monday, July 1, the Census Bureau has said.",
        "But Census Bureau officials have also said that with exceptional effort and additional resources, that deadline could be pushed back to October 31.",
        "Opponents of this question have been fighting it for more than a year.",
        "How did they react to the ruling?",
        "Well, a lot of these challengers of the citizenship question - more than two dozen states, cities and other groups - around the country are really calling this a major victory.",
        "They think that ultimately speaking - that practically, it would be very hard for the Trump administration to try to get the courts to ultimately allow them to add this question at this point, given these very tight deadlines.",
        "New York state Attorney General Letitia James spoke before President Trump tweeted.",
        "She spoke in New York City, and she said that if President Trump's administration tries to come up with another reason for this question, quote, \"\"we will see them in court again.\"\" Let's listen to what else she had to say.",

        "I want to back up for a second.",
        "Why are the stakes so high, and why has this question become so controversial?",
        "It's because when we're talking about the census, we are talking about power, and we are talking about money.",
        "We're talking about how Congressional seats and electoral college votes are redistributed amongst the states every 10 years, based on population counts.",
        "And we're talking about how close to $900 billion a year in federal tax dollars are distributed for schools, for roads, for Medicare, for Medicaid, for other public services in local communities.",

        "Is something going on?",

        "You know, these are all separate systems of course.",
        "I think that there's probably two things going on.",
        "In some of these systems, part of the delay is not a result of maintenance problems, but sort of the services being victims of their own success.",
        "You know, a big problem that's happening in New York is simply that ridership is at something close to an all-time high.",
        "And the more people who a ride a subway, the more time it takes for people to get on and off.",
        "And so delays start to add up.",
        "That's not the case in some of these other cities where ridership is maybe growing but not growing as fast.",
        "But I think that the common thread in a lot of these cities is just that these systems are old.",
        "The systems are old and maintenance has been deferred on them.",

        "So it's part of the crumbling infrastructure problem in America?",
        "(Laughter) Yeah, you could say that.",
        "I mean, I think that, you know - and certainly, when you think about it, these are some of the oldest pieces of infrastructure we have.",
        "Often when we talk about the crumbling infrastructure, folks are worried about our highway system or our bridges and so forth.",
        "But as you said, New York subway system is 112 years old.",
        "Boston's is even older.",
        "The rail system in San Francisco is also quite old.",

        "It's modified some troubled mortgages and foreclosed on others.",
        "This month, Ross' company becomes one of a handful that will get government help to buy so-called toxic assets.",
        "They will get the assets off the books of banks, buy them at a discount.",
        "In the latest of several conversations with Ross, we asked about the evolving plan for these mortgage-backed securities.",
        "The government will not be helping to buy all the bad assets.",
        "Well, it's a small fraction but what is more important, I think, is the fact of the government program becoming available has corrected most of the problems that the asset-backed commercial paper market had had.",
        "Because when you think about it, the real reason that the paper is trading at a lower price than fundamental value is that people have unwarranted fears.",
        "And as they see corrective measures coming in, presumably they will lose some of that unwarranted fear and get back to normal.",
        "I'm curious if you think - when you look at the banking system, when you look at the mortgage market, if you think, as so many people do seem to think, that the worst is over.",
        "Well, I think the worst is over in that houses are not going to go to zero.",
        "I think that the tremendous amount of press coverage of the rise in prices in the month of June over the month of May is a little bit exaggerated.",
        "First of all, June is seasonally a stronger month for house sales than May, anyway.",
        "But the unfortunate fact is that the prices in June this year were still way down from June a year ago.",
        "So I think it was a little bit of misplaced enthusiasm to think that the end has come.",
        "The end of this problem will come when June compares favorably to June a year ago, and July compares favorably to July a year ago."

        "Oh, so collectively, our asset values have gone way down, but we haven't really been able to pay down that much debt in the meantime.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And that's the structural problem that we have.",
        "And I think what will define the new normal is, what's really going on with these government programs is you're starting to transfer liabilities from private individuals to the public sector.",
        "And what you're saying, in the end, is if this debt doesn't go away, the government is going to borrow money, in effect, to pay it back.",
        "Well, either borrow money or guarantee it.",
        "Now, a lot of the loans that they're guaranteeing, they'll never have to pay on because once you right- size the mortgage so that the payments are affordable, the probabilities of that mortgage going into default again should be a lot lower.",
