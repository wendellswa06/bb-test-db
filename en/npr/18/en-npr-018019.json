        "Nice to be with you again.",
        "Super Bowl XLV will be played on Sunday in Dallas.",
        "The game matches two of the National Football League's flagship franchises, the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers.",
        "Sportswriter Stefan Fatsis joins us now as he does most Fridays to talk about this game.",
        "And, Stefan, it seems like the NFL couldnt ask for much more.",
        "Youve got these two legendary teams.",
        "Theyve both got passionate fan bases.",
        "They're playing for a championship.",
        "Dallas even managed to pat some snow on the ground for them to make them feel at home.",
        "Yeah, thats a really good way of looking at it to.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Theyve imported some snow to honor these teams, which, by the way, have 18 NFL titles between them - Super Bowl and pre-Super Bowl.",
        "The Packers were founded in 1919 by Curly Lambeau.",
        "They were named for a local meatpacker, the Indian Packing Company.",
        "The Steelers joined the NFL in 1933.",
        "The boxing promoter Art Rooney paid $2,500 for a team.",
        "And now, in modern times - and this is not something you're going to hear a lot about this week - is that neither of these ownership probably should even be running their teams.",
        "The Packers are the only community-owned franchise in major pro sports.",
        "They went public to avoid a collapse in 1949, nearly folded in the late 1950s, and then Vince Lombardi came to town and they went on this great championship run.",
        "The Rooney family is still in control, largely because though it had fallen out of compliance with ownership rules in the NFL - as more of the billionaires came into the league - the NFL's league office really pushed bankers, a couple of years ago, to cut a deal to make sure this family stayed.",
        "Now, Stefan, the other backdrop for the game is the state of the labor negotiations between the NFL's team owners and the players union.",
        "Is that somehow seeping into Super Bowl week?",
        "Pretty much in reporters' questions constantly.",
        "The NFL players association had Demaurice Smith hold a news conference yesterday.",
        "He was very stern.",
        "He threatened to decertify the union if the owners, as many are predicting, lockout the players when the contract - labor contract - expires on March 4th.",
        "He said the players oppose an 18-game season, which is what the owners want, up from 16 now, because of the risk of more injuries."

        "I actually felt it, but didn't, you know, with a stick.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And I think, honestly, it would drive more people away from some of these systems except that, in a couple of these cities, a lot of the folks who ride the subway - that really is the only option.",
        "If you're in New York or even in parts of downtown Boston or parts of downtown Chicago, switching over to driving is extremely expensive.",
        "And it also gets in the way of what's an important but also largely overlooked role of public transit in the United States, which is that it's an important social service.",
        "Particularly once you get outside of the New York cities and Bostons of the world, transit riders are disproportionately low-income.",
        "And this is a way that we move around people who can't afford the typical way of moving around for an American, which is owning a private automobile.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Any one or two things you'd like to recommend, professor?",
        "If we look to some other countries, you know - and London is a good example.",
        "London has been - has really been dramatically working to upgrade its own system, which is as old - actually, older than New York's.",
        "One thing London did that I think, ultimately, a lot of American cities are going to have to at least wrestle with is that they started charging drivers for the congestion they cause.",
        "And that those two things.",
        "One is that simply charging people to drive at busy times and in busy places accomplishes a goal that a lot of people want transit to accomplish but that transit can't accomplish, which is reduce traffic congestion.",
        "But it also generates a lot of money from a broad base.",
        "And some of that, not even all of it, some of that can go into upgrading the transportation system.",

        "While crafting this measure, lawmakers should consider some fine points.",
        "What if you don't like your neighbors, so you train your dog to bark exactly 19 minutes, then briefly pause?",
        "Also, if you are jailed for continuous barking, can you bring your dog?",
        "If you were planning to celebrate this St. Patrick's Day with a glass of green beer and a plate of corned beef and cabbage, well, you go right ahead.",
        "But, these days, Irish cuisine has a lot more to offer, as we're going to hear now from our next guest, award-winning Irish chef and food writer Darina Allen.",

        "She's co-founder of the Ballymaloe Cookery School in County Cork.",

        "But, basically, lots of people don't eat corned beef and cabbage from one end of the year to the other in Ireland.",
        "But I think it's sort of got a nostalgic thing.",
        "It's like an immigrant's memory, food memories so to speak.",
        "Oh, well, that's a nice way to think of it.",
        "So you've chosen something with cabbage as a starter for our Irish meal - spring cabbage soup.",
        "How is it made?",
        "A lot of our soups - and we're kind of famous for our soups in Ballymaloe - are made on, you could say, a formula.",
        "Say, take one cup of chopped onions, one cup of chopped potatoes, three cups of any vegetable of your choice - in this case, it's cabbage - and then five cups of stock and then a nice bit of seasoning.",
        "And you just put the onions and the potatoes together first.",
        "Then, while that's happening, just add a little good Irish butter and - until they're soft but not colored.",
        "In the meantime, bring the stock to the boil, and then add that into the potato-and-onion base.",
        "Bring it to the boil, and cook them until the potatoes and onions are just cooked.",
        "And then, add in the chopped cabbage.",
        "Boil it for just two or three minutes on this - just tender but still green.",
        "And then, whiz up the whole lot, and maybe add a little cream and, of course, season it up.",
        "One of the things that I'm hearing you say is, like, don't boil everything to death, you know?",
        "(Laughter).",
        "Oh, totally, don't.",
        "Let it still live.",
        "I did a lot of television in Ireland for many, many years.",

        "Oh, well, Dingle, as you may or may not know, is in County Kerry.",

        "And then, they'd make a crust, actually, with the lamb fat and butter and water, a hot water crust pastry.",
        "But we actually changed it to - instead of using the lamb fat, which is a little heavy for people, nowadays.",
        "We use butter, and it's a fantastic pastry, that one.",
