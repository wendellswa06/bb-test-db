        "He also led the 2007 Alaska-Canada Barrenlands Traverse, a 2,000-mile-plus expedition across the Arctic, part of the IPY research effort, and we'll talk to him about that.",
        "Thank you for being with us today, Matthew.",
        "Well, let me begin with you.",
        "We have a variety of scientists on the panel here to talk about their own various specialties.",
        "Everyone here is a specialist in what they do - glaciers, permafrost, sea ice.",
        "But climate change is really about what happens to the whole system, isn't it?",
        "It just doesn't isolate itself out like the scientists study it?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Whether it's here or in the lower 48, climate changes that affects people is all of the things sort of put together.",
        "It's the sum of the parts, and it's how the environment in which we live in everyday changes.",
        "So, as scientists, we look at the individual parts.",
        "But as people, we were affected by the whole.",
        "Let me - let's begin and get into how all that is happening.",
        "Terry Chapin, how does a few degrees of temperature change the whole process?",
        "What happens in Alaskan Arctic when the temperature starts to rise?",
        "Well, when things start to rise, when the temperature starts to rise, one of the main things that happens is that - we're at a temperature here where things change from ice to water for a much larger part of the year.",
        "So, for example, the snow melts earlier - the ground, which is very close to the freezing point for an annual average changes from being a solid bottom to our ecosystems to being a porous bottom that can - where the water can drain through.",
        "So this completely changes us from - to a much more sensitive environment in terms of changes in rainfall and temperature.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And how does that all cascade - and you can all jump in if you like to - how did it cascade through into a chain reaction?",
        "What happens next?",
        "You have more water...",
        "Well, for example..."

        "...is that effect of vegetation, things like that?",
        "For example, when you change the amount of water in low-lying areas, then you flood the forests, and you change from forest to some wetland.",
        "In the upland areas, things dry out and you're more likely to have droughts, fires, insect outbreaks.",
        "When you change the fires, that alters the availability of moose or caribous and habitat for those and therefore, the resources that people have for subsistence.",
        "It changes the rivers from being solid highways in the wintertime that are nice solid ice-covered features to things that are very dangerous to travel on.",
        "And in a world where there's very few roads, that makes all the difference in the world.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And the sea ice was one of the first things we saw.",
        "I think that people got to notice about, you know, a real change.",
        "There were stories years ago starting to show that the sea ice was missing in the summertime.",
        "Right.",
        "And that was a very - well, we're going to talk more about that a bit later.",

        "What did you see there?",
        "Well, there - I mean, we saw a lot of snow and ice actually.",
        "And I think...",
        "That's a good thing, right?",
        "It is a good thing, but as Terry was mentioning, I mean, it's one of the essential things that is changing.",
        "Seen from space, over a period of time, the Arctic is a very white place.",
        "And because it's white, it reflects a tremendous amount of solar energy.",
        "And as we begin to shorten the time that the Arctic spends in its white phase and turns into its green or liquid phase, then we don't send as much energy back to space.",
        "We get into this what's called the feedback loop.",
        "So one of the things we saw is lots of snow and ice, but that - it's not in danger.",
        "We'll still have snow and ice in the future here, but it won't be here as much.",
        "And strangely enough, that's a very serious thing.",
        "You think we'd like to have less snow and ice, but that means the Arctic, which is one of the radiators for the heat that comes into Earth, won't be any near as efficient as it was.",
        "So as we travel along in a sense, we traveled on the snow and ice, and we - I think we came to recognize it as an essential feature of the Arctic that's fundamentally changing in a very profound way.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Well, Harrison, geologists - people - glaciologists, the people who study glaciers, were some of the first scientists to sound the alarm.",
        "I remember years ago - we're talking about the Arctic - but I remember over 25 years ago, I was in Antarctica talking to glaciologists on the Western Slope.",
        "They we're talking then about, you know, if we lose the sea ice that's holding this shelf back, it just can slide into the ocean.",
        "The glaciers are very, very good indicators, are they not?",
        "Yeah.",
        "They're more than dynamic.",
        "They're, in some cases -particularly, the glaciers that reaches sea level - they're actually unstable.",
        "And they - massive changes, breakups can be triggered by fairly minor events.",
        "And that's going on in Alaska in the Columbia Glacier.",
        "Now, that's been going on through the historical record of the last 200 years.",
        "And I guess the - one of the big issues is whether or not this may begin in Greenland, the Greenland ice sheet, which is bigger than all of Alaska or the Antarctic ice sheet, which is bigger than all of the United States.",
        "And why do we worry about the Greenland ice sheet?",
        "What could happen there?",
        "I think the major most obvious thing is sea level.",
        "Right now, it's increasing at about 3 millimeters a year.",
        "And if that may seem small, but if you live a normal healthy life, that's a better part of a foot in one person's lifetime.",
        "And it's definitely accelerating.",
        "And - but if something or catastrophic were to happen in Greenland or parts of Greenland that would may turn out to be like Alaska, it would have a major effect on sea level."

        "And I thought, you know, wow.",
        "This is the permafrost.",
        "Well, we're living in a great natural laboratory here in Alaska.",
        "And we have this tremendous gradient of climate from about minus 12 mean annual temperature up on the North Slope to about plus positive 2 around Anchorage.",
        "And we have permafrost that buries across that whole extent of gradient.",
        "And so, we are kind of seeing the whole transition that you would see with a warming climate across this gradient.",
        "And so it gives us a great opportunity to see how permafrost can respond, perhaps predict how or respond in the future.",
        "And we're basically being hit by the proverbial hockey stick of the climate curve.",
        "And we're coming out of the little Ice Age.",
        "We could have been heading into an Ice Age without the intervention of human activity on this planet.",
        "And we've warmed, perhaps, 4-, 5-degrees-C in the last 150 years.",
        "And this is a tremendous temperature increase for the stability of permafrost.",
        "And we see that all around this - when I drove into town, I was avoiding the ruts on the road going to (unintelligible) valley, just getting on in here.",
        "So it really is the one of the canaries in the mine, the one of the first indicators that something is changing?",
        "Yeah.",
        "In fact, one of the earliest observations of climate change was made by a scientist in Northern Alaska, Leffingwell, right around 1910.",
        "He was looking at permafrost temperatures that have been measured in a well over and rushing - already had interpreted the warming curve in the permafrost to be a sign of global warming.",
        "He didn't quite put it in that phrase, but he understood the implications of the warming permafrost.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Well, we're going to have to take a break and come back and talk lots more about Alaska, about the Artic regions, about climate change, global warming, with my guests, Terry Chapin, Torre Jorgenson, William Harrison and Matthew Sturm, and come back.",

        "Matt, you want to take that?",
        "Well, as far as the desalinization, the Arctic Ocean has the most amount of fresh water going into it of any ocean in the world from enormous rivers - the old Lena Sea, the McKenzie and so on.",
        "In addition, then there's tremendous amount of fresh water coming off of Greenland.",
        "The issue there is that as you desalinate the Arctic Ocean, the amount of fresh water that pours out of the ocean changes and could in fact impact the thermohaline circulation.",
        "That's a fancy word to just say the conveyor belt that exists in the Atlantic Ocean that basically brings heat from the equator north towards the European continent."
