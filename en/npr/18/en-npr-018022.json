        "A lot of models are being run now.",
        "I think the issue is still on doubt as to whether injecting enough fresh water into the Arctic basin could change how that circulates.",
        "But there are some worrying studies that suggest it could in fact change it ways that would alter the climate very dramatically.",
        "I'm not sure I can answer about the super storms, though.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, we'll do that when we go to Florida.",
        "We'll talk about that on New Orleans follow-up.",
        "Torre Jorgenson, let's talk about what happens along the coastlines; talk about, you know, storms - the coastlines take the worst battering, do they not?",
        "Well, about 80 percent of Alaskan's population and most of the circumarctic population lives right along the coast.",
        "And so we're intimately connected to sea ice, to the storms, and climate, and much of the Arctic populations live on permafrost directly in contact.",
        "So it's a transition zone that could be affected by the retreat of sea ice and opening a larger fetch of open water during the storm season particularly in October, and ice-rich permafrost is particularly susceptible to thaw in(ph) during that part of the term, and also, lot of those posts are built out of very erodable silt.",
        "And so, every village along the coast in northern Alaska is having its share of problems, and there is a couple in particular, Shismaref and Kivalina, that are in particularly endangered by storms and opening fetch of sea ice and living on ice-rich permafrost.",
        "Can you actually fly over the landscape and see where the permafrost is failing?",
        "It's one of the great ways that we can tell where permafrost is.",
        "Just the frost action and the growth of ice leaves distinctive patterns in the ground.",
        "And then when it thaws, it leaves these collapsing lakes and bogs and pens, and that's one of the best characteristic that we can use for trying to look at the patterns of permafrost across the landscape.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I was told that you can just watch in places where the trees are bent over, and we took the Alaskan railroad and we saw places where the trees were falling over, and that was a symptom that the permafrost was turning liquid in those places.",
        "Well, in the interior of Alaska, about 60 percent of the terrain is permafrost and maybe 40 percent of the terrain is ice-rich permafrost, and those are the areas that are susceptible to collapse.",
        "And many in the audience here in Alaska, when you fly out of the airport in Fairbanks, when you fly over the Flat's(ph) town - on Flat's - about almost half of the terrain now has collapsed from these thawing permafrost.",
        "And there's extensive areas where you just see the dead forest poking out of the water where the ground has collapsed.",
        "Terry Chapin, Fairbanks - if I've read the travel brochures correctly -has holds the record in the world for the greatest temperature swings, right?",
        "That goes down in lowest temperature - highest temperature swings.",
        "Have the yearly temperature's been changing at all?",
        "Well, you're right.",
        "We have a highly continental climate, so it's cold in the winter and hot in the summer.",
        "And the climate has been changing a lot.",
        "Since about the mid-70s, it's been a lot warmer.",
        "And of course when that first happened, we had no way of knowing whether that was just an unusual year or not but it just keeps getting warmer.",
        "So we're - we used to be six or eight weeks of minus 40 weather in the wintertime, now it's unusual to have more than a week or so.",
        "So we see these kinds of large of temperature changes and that has huge implications."

        "Hi.",
        "Based on scientific studies, the native elders are reporting that the tundra plants are growing and becoming actual shrubs.",
        "So my question is, with that many more leaves, is there any chance that they would absorb carbon and maybe slow down of the effect?",
        "Anybody want to jump in on that one?",
        "Sure, I can give that one a try.",
        "Yes, when you get more leaves, you're going to have more carbon absorbed by photosynthesis and stored.",
        "But the problem is that the temperature effects on respiration or the release of carbon from the plants and soils are even stronger.",
        "So, at least right now, we seem to be in a situation where we're losing carbon to the atmosphere and that - as you're probably suggesting - is a positive feedback to warming.",
        "Matthew Sturm?",
        "But one thing that we have do have a pretty good handle on is this -as the tundra - as the shrubs grow up in the tundra, of course - the tundra is very short and in the winter it's covered by snow - but if the shrubs grow tall enough then they protrude above the snow, now, instead of being a beautifully white landscape, it's kind of a speckled landscape with these dark shrubs.",
        "And that in fact, does have a fairly important difference in that.",
        "It's going to absorb more, more solar energy through the winter and particularly in the spring and fall.",
        "And we believe that's going to have one of these positive feedback impacts.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "Dr. Harrison, how do you measure the size of the glacier?",
        "You think of ruler measurements, walk it off, you know?",
        "There's a whole spectrum of high-tech.",
        "You can start with memories.",
        "They change that fast that you can remember changes - old photos.",
        "And we use a very accurate laser altimeter in a small airplane to map the surface elevations, and keep going right up to space, where the most recent technique measures change in gravity from satellites.",
        "Do you actually have to measure it, let's say, the same time every year, so you say it's been this year?",
        "We try very hard to do that whenever the flying weather permits.",
        "And if it doesn't we don't even try."

        "We're going to bring in another guest because no picture of the changing landscape in Alaska and the Arctic would be complete without a look at the sea ice.",
        "And the discovery of the thinning of the Arctic Sea ice was one of the defining moments, one of the early warning bells that global warming was indeed real.",
        "Joining me now by satellite phone from Barrow, Alaska, is Hajo Eicken.",
        "He is an associate professor at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska in Fairbanks.",
        "Thanks for talking with us today, Dr. Eicken.",
        "Yes, good morning.",
        "Good morning to you.",
        "Tell us about the sea ice.",
        "How - tell us how it has changed over the years?",
        "Well, as you've already mentioned and several other of your guests have pointed out, there's been later ice formation in the fall in the Arctic.",
        "Overall, the Arctic Sea ice cover has been thinning over the past few decades.",
        "We've, in particular, seen very significant reductions in the summer ice extent, when the ice starts to melt back.",
        "And some of the largest changes actually have been observed in the western Arctic, north of Alaska and the northeastern Russian Arctic, where we have seen a lack of thick multiyear ice that has been replaced by seasonal ice that's just forms in the fall, late fall, early winter and then melts back completely again in the spring and early summer.",
        "Now, why is sea ice so important?",
        "And why is knowing and watching it change so important?",
        "Yeah, that's probably - it's hard, I suppose, if you live somewhere in the middle of the United States and you think the Artic is a long ways away then you - but maybe the analogy is this.",
        "If you were in a building whose air conditioning had gone out in Austin, Texas, say, you would quickly notice that the building was heating up and that was bad.",
        "You'd start to call around to the - maybe the public, the maintenance guys and say, what's going on?",
        "Well, the air conditioning is broking - broken.",
        "The process has changed a little bit, too.",
        "So it's...",
        "Well, again, some of the people on your show have already pointed this out that, you know, you have to think of the Arctic Ocean as a system where a lot of the changes that occur over the water and over the ice impact temperatures and weather on the land.",
        "The prime reason of course is that the sea ice cover is a very component of the Earth's heat and radiation budget because of its high albedo.",
        "The fact that it reflects a lot of light back into the atmosphere, into space, it provides something of a cooling to the planet.",
        "And if you replace that ice cover by open water - one of the substances with the lowest albedo that we have on Earth - you're adding a significant amount of heat to the water.",
        "And in fact, we're now, I think, several colleagues, and including the work that we're doing here, were starting to see that that heat in the ocean is lingering around throughout the winter, is contributing to a melt back of the ice from the bottom.",
        "And if you talk to local people here in Barrow, who of course spends a lot of time out on the ice hunting and for other activities, they're also starting to see a lot of these changes now occur."

        "At least one computer model predicts that there may be no sea ice in the Artic in the summer by the year 2040.",
        "Do you think that is a possibility?",
        "Well, I personally wouldn't plan any family vacations based on that.",
        "I mean, you have to understand that, of course, I mean, that the models give you a general indication that what seems to be happening now is that we're transitioning from one - what seems to be one state of the climate where we have sea ice in the Artic Ocean in the summer or year round, and that state seems to be transitioning into another state where we are not seeing any sea ice in the summer, and we just have seasonal ice that forms and then melts and reforms every year.",
        "When exactly that transition is going to occur and even, you know, if this is a true transition or not, I - you know, as somebody who's mostly focusing on observations, I wouldn't want to have to guess on when exactly that's occurring.",
        "But clearly reasoned both modeling results and observations have shown that some of these changes are very, very rapid, and you can have these spurts where in fact ice retreat is even faster than what with the models predict.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I have one more question for you, then I'll let you go, Hajo.",
        "How would the melting of sea ice or how does the sea ice way up here in the Artic region affect anybody else in other parts of the world?",
        "Is it important to them?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I would argue that, you know, recently, we've seen a number of model studies that show that with the changes in the ice cover, of course, you're changing atmospheric circulation patterns.",
        "You're changing precipitation patterns.",
        "There's an interesting study, a model study that was published a couple of years ago that indicates that as the ice edge moves further north, you're shifting the position of the Aleutian Low pressure system.",
        "That's very important for climate in the lower 48.",
        "And as a result of that, there maybe as much as a 30 percent reduction in water availability in the American West -California, Colorado, you know, those states that already very hard hit by water shortages.",
        "So there's - even though some of this regional impacts are difficult to quantify, there's clearly an impact there.",
        "The other, other very, very significant impact I would argue that we're starting to see now as people become more aware of these changes is that potentially global patterns of trade and just the geopolitics of the Artic are changing as you're seeing changes in the ice cover.",
        "And you have a lot of nations now, circumarctic nations, who are reevaluating their economic zones.",
        "And so I would argue that there's impacts, both real and perceived, that are quite significant.",
        "Well, I want thank you very much for taking time to be with us.",
        "Thank you, Ira.",

        "Yeah, hi.",
        "I've got an impression from a geology course that I've taken that we've had major climate shifts probably 18 or 19 times in recorded geological history, and that with the ocean covering three quarters of the globe, it would appear that suboceanic heat fence, methane hydrate deposits combined with factors like super volcanoes - Toba, for example - could have a much more significant impact on the turning point on climate change than anything that's happening on terra firma.",
