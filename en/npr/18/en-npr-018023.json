        "We're talking this hour about climate change, and how it's reshaping Alaska and the Arctic with my guest Harry Chapin, Torre Jorgenson, William Harrison and Matthew Sturm.",
        "Our number here is 1-800-989-8255 in the auditorium at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks.",
        "Let's go to this gentleman in the aisle.",
        "Hi.",
        "The discussion today has focused mostly on Alaska, but I'm sure there are similar changes taking place in the Russian Arctic, the Canadian Arctic and other circumarctic nations.",
        "In the context of the International Polar Year, I'm wondering if you could comment on cooperation among scientists from these different nations, and perhaps differences in ways that these different nation's scientists are approaching questions of climate change.",
        "Anybody who want to take - Matthew?",
        "Well, I'll start.",
        "At the bench level, at our - at the science level, we really don't see borders in the Artic - air, water, snow - everything moves across without knowing.",
        "Its going from one country to another, and we can't solve the problems related to climate change without crossing borders.",
        "So my personal case - the traverse I did across Alaska was U.S.",
        "and Canadian.",
        "So at that level, it's pretty straightforward.",
        "As you move up, the issues really sort of come back to how you get your money to do the research, and that varies from one country to another.",
        "Each of the scientists in the country have to figure out their own system and how to work that and they're pretty clever at that.",
        "So by and large, you sort of meet them half way and hope for the best, but we don't see any borders sort of at the physical level we deal with.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Terry Chapin, there are a lot of fires burning in Alaska, aren't there?",
        "That's right.",
        "One of the things that results from warming and especially from the loss of permafrost is that things dry out.",
        "When they dry out, they burn.",
        "The wildfires are probably the most important disturbance in the Borial Forest, and the area burned in western north America has doubled in the last 40 years or so.",
        "And so this has huge impacts both smoke impacts on communities, health risk, sometimes the air quality is like that of Los Angeles.",
        "And then also just the affects on habitat for animals that are important to subsistence users, changes the availability of moose, caribou and so fort to the local communities."

        "And, you know, everybody talks about the salmon in Alaska.",
        "Are the salmon populations being affected by the climate change?",
        "Well, as you mentioned at the very beginning, everything is connected in everything else, and so there certainly are effects of changes in water temperature on salmon and parasite loads and things like that.",
        "Let's go to the audience.",
        "Yes, ma'am.",
        "Step up, please.",
        "We'll get to you.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Thank you for this opportunity to ask this question.",
        "And I don't know about what its risk for another show, but my concern is that because of the audience that is available especially through NPR, that we can impact the dialogue that needs to happen on so many levels.",
        "Are there scientists developing and studying models of how people live, will live or can live in the future world with some of these changes already in effect?",
        "And I realized that that's hypothetical, but I don't know if you can address that.",
        "Any - you wanted?",
        "There was a very interesting study the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, which was completed a year a half ago, which basically explored scenarios of changes that people can make in their lifestyles that will influence that way in which the climate system and the Earth in general will -is likely to change over the next few years.",
        "So I think we have some choices that we can make and we are having - it's getting more and more clear what those choices are and the consequences of those choices.",
        "Torre Jorgenson, I understand that one of the side effects of melting permafrost is methane release.",
        "We haven't heard much about that.",
        "Well, there are several large consequences to the loss of permafrost - effects on human facilities, the changes in habitats from forest, to lakes, and fence and coastlines, as you've mentioned.",
        "And then one that's deserving a lot of attention is what's happening with the carbon balance both in CO2 release and or sequestration, or methane release.",
        "And the permafrost is a tremendous store of frozen peat and organic material.",
        "And when you release that either in a aerobic environment where it can be mineralized to CO2, you can release that large store of CO2, or in a anaerobic water-flooded environment that can be methane.",
        "And there's been - a few exciting studies in the last few years on just what - how large the potential consequences of this methane release can be.",
        "There's a lot of work that still has to be done to understand that in the most extreme context.",
        "It can be described as a methane bomb, but that is really is a thing that we have to grapple.",
        "And then the other really interesting item of concern that goes to Tom's questions of the large historical and geological perspective is, what is the stability of these methane hydrates or clathrates in a sub-sea environment where temperature, cold temperatures and pressures can maintain these methane stores throughout the world but also in Arctic Ocean seas.",
        "And there's some evidence or hypothesis that this methane released from these clathrates have driven very large warmings in large historical periods.",
        "And there's a big effort to grapple what is the potential dimension of the problem and that's a big unknown at this time."

        "Why alarm the public if we can't do much about it?",
        "Am I reading this correctly, Matthew?",

        "And we're worried, as Torre said, about the surprises.",
        "So our conservative streak over a beer - I don't have to be conservative, but as a scientist then I have to be a bit conservative because I don't know about the methane.",
        "I'm not sure about the carbon uptake.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Torre, do you agree with that impression?",
        "Well, there are so many complex interactions between these systems and we often look at just a couple of parts at a time.",
        "And when you put down the complexity of it, it becomes somewhat unpredictable and so - then we become cautious because we get way out beyond what we feel comfortable predicting.",

        "And we've been seeing them within our lifetime.",

        "And for us it's a dramatic time.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Did - you can jump in.",
        "It seems though that we do know - we know a lot about what's causing these things and we know that it's relatively straightforward and we have the technology to reduce fossil fuel consumption, which is one of the important drivers of change.",
        "So we know that we can reduce the threats to climate change.",
        "At the same time, we know that we're like driving the Titanic - it's going to be slow to turn.",
        "And so even - no matter what we do in terms of reducing climate change, if we want our children to have a better world, we know that we need to make those changes now for their future.",
