        "Hello.",
        "I've lived in Fairbanks for 32 years and the biggest change I've noticed in those decades is the drying.",
        "The summers have gotten a lot drier and the winters have gotten a lot less snowy.",
        "And that affects things greatly even more than the skiing in the winter and the fishing in the summer.",
        "The forest fires of '04 made this place miserable.",
        "And if that happens again, real estate prices will go down.",
        "There are also studies, I think, have been done at the Geophysical Institute that showed that lakes in the interior and freshwater non-glacial rivers are also shrinking.",
        "There is less boating, less fishing and similar impacts.",
        "If you could discuss that, please.",
        "Terry Chapin, you want to take a crack?",
        "Sure.",
        "Those observations are quite correct and they've been -people in the villages have been talking about these changes for years now.",
        "And they've been really observing these changes, and they see changes in the waterfowl that are available to hunt.",
        "Changes in forest fires, as you pointed out.",
        "And we're likely to see more of those extremely dry years in the future, and to see those more and more frequently.",
        "We see extreme fire years, perhaps three or four times a decade now, rather than once or twice, which is what it used to be.",
        "And so these kinds of changes are widespread and they are likely to become more extreme.",
        "Are we going to see more diseases spread, more insects and pestilence like that move around?",
        "Yes.",
        "That's quite likely to be true.",
        "For example, in the Kenai Peninsula in southern Alaska, the warming - the gradual warming caused the bark beetles to shift from a two-year life cycle to a one-year life cycle.",
        "And that really changed the balance between the trees and the insects and gave the insects the upper hand and caused a massive bark beetle outbreak and forest die back.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And we'll see the nature of the forest change themselves.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think the forests are quite likely to change.",
        "In some places, we may be losing forests to grasslands.",
        "In other places, we may be losing tundra to forests.",
        "So I think we're in for a lot of changes.",
        "And since most of the native people in Alaska live in villages that are fixed in place, they don't have the luxury of moving to where there - the vegetation is that they are familiar with.",
        "Now, they're going to be stuck with new conditions.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And yet you're still optimistic about working our way out of this?",
        "I think we have to.",
        "We have to reduce the pressures for changing climate, and we need to be prepared to adapt to the changes that do occur."

        "But there is a movement among the Shiites to set up a Shiite super-region in the south with the same powers that the Kurdistan region has in the north.",
