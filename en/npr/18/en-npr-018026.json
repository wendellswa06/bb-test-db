        "If you'll recall, the Senate really didn't want to hold the hearing.",
        "They'd already held Clarence Thomas' hearings.",

        "And then these new allegations emerged.",
        "Well, the testimony that I was giving came in a second round of the hearings.",
        "The Senate, with Chairman Biden, was encouraged to reopen the hearings, and after being persuaded by a number of voices, women's voices from the public, they did so.",
        "Chairman Biden decided to reconvene to hear my testimony.",
        "Well, I remember the woman who - because I see the video.",
        "And - but I remember her, too.",
        "In so many ways, I'm really still the same person.",
        "But in other ways, I've actually grown quite a bit.",
        "I've continued teaching, and so in that way I'm the same person.",
        "I've continued my work as an academic, although I have changed locations.",
        "I'm no longer at a law school.",
        "I'm teaching at a school of public policy, but I also - I teach law.",
        "So if I had to say where is that - what's different about the woman that I am today in terms of - I think it's reflected in my writing of this book, \"\"Reimagining Equality.\"\" I see \"\"Reimagining Equality\"\" really as having grown out of the experience of the hearing 20 years ago, my continued work on issues of equality and how I'm seeing it now in a different context, in the context of the mortgage meltdown and housing crisis.",
        "And you tell the story in the context of, well, not just your family but Americans, women and women of color in particular, and their stories through the period.",
        "I'd never heard it quite put this way before.",
        "You describe those who were liberated by the Civil War as the first Africans ever to be described as American citizens or as African-Americans.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "When you think about that, and you think it really wasn't that many years ago, I think it wasn't that many years ago and particularly because my grandfather, who was born in 1864, was one of those first generations, and my grandmother, of course, was born a few years later, but that was the first generation really of African-Americans, people who could call themselves American legitimately, by law.",
        "And so that was a critical moment for us to think about it is in the life of a people, really, you know, over - just a little over 150 years now.",
        "So those things have significance and help us think about us, the country, how much we have changed in just, for me, two generations."

        "And I'll take any comments off the air.",

        "And I would simply say to the caller that in fact I believe it was Jim or Gin, I couldn't quite understand.",
