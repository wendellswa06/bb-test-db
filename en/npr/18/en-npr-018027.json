        "But she knew that she wanted us to be prepared to have access to every opportunity there was, and she worked to make sure that that was true.",
        "One of the things you write about is that after the Civil War, many, including many African-Americans, thought that the most important institution would be marriage: That would cement their place in this country after all they had been through.",
        "Then to some degree that fixation became centered on the home, on owning a piece of property, and that would cement people in a community and cement people in the country.",
        "And you write that in many ways, both of those have proved illusory.",
        "But have proved illusory, beginning with, you know, when we talk about where did those ideas about the home being the focal point of our entre into citizenship.",
        "Really it was an idea by Booker T.",
        "Washington that if African-Americans could just show themselves to be good homemakers and home builders that they could, in fact, prove themselves to be worthy of full democracy in the United States.",
        "He believed that that was true, even that the home was even more important than laws.",
        "And in fact my grandparents, Henry Eliot, Ida Crooks Eliot, did in fact get that farm.",
        "They got 80 acres of land in 1895 and homesteaded that land.",
        "It was that farm and that land that they ultimately had to abandon for a number of reasons that sound very similar to some of the things that you hear today in today's news stories.",

        "Okay, I would like to thank Anita for the huge difference it made, her coming forward made, in the huge difference between the way I handled being approached inappropriately in the workplace when I was 18 and the way my daughter at 18, 35 years later, was able to handle it.",
        "She was completely confident in her right to say you're a pervert, get away from me.",
        "Her friends all agreed with the way she handled it.",
        "And this man who was at the time 45, about the age my co-worker was when I was 18, he didn't take no for an answer the first time, but after the second time, she threatened to go to the manager, and again she didn't have to feel like she was breaking any rules or like she was, you know, a rat or, you know, that she was square or anything else.",

        "And I love these stories about mothers and daughters.",

        "You scared me.",
