        "And what happens is most of the liquid parts of the wood are flashed off and you're left with almost pure carbon.",
        "I mean, if you look at gas, you know, something like 90 percent of the heating value that came out of the ground actually gets used in the grill.",

        "And it was kind of an amusing experience for families and friends, because they were watching us measure everything out as we did it, measure afterwards and all that sort of thing."
