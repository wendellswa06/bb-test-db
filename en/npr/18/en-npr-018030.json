        "And the most serious that we have seen all over the world was the attack on Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of one of the factions of the Movement for Democratic Change.",
        "He spent time in the hospital with a possible skull fracture, and this has earned the condemnation of practically the entire world.",
        "How are people reacting, specifically, in Africa - African leaders to this development?",
        "Well, there's been a lot of criticism of what they are calling muted responses by African leaders.",
        "Now, Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete flew there for talks with Mugabe.",
        "He went on Thursday, and he said that the talks were a great success.",
        "But they held a press conference and Kikwete was standing behind Mugabe when he told - responded to the international criticism by saying they could all go hang.",

        "Unemployment is something like 80 percent.",
        "Inflation is almost 2,000 percent.",

        "But probably, the most helpful thing you could do is when you're done, if you could shutdown your grill and try to reuse what coals are there.",
        "Now, some grills are actually relatively easy to shutdown but a lot of them are quite difficult.",
        "But still, you know, pour some water on it and use them again, because you're really wasting it when the rest of it just goes up in the air.",
        "That's great advice."
