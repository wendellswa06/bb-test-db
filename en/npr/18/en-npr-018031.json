        "This is the very first presidential-level decision that either of them will make.",
        "Choosing a vice president sends a huge message.",
        "The vice-presidential candidate himself might not actually do anything for you electorally, but your choice of him is a big deal and sends a very important message.",
        "And you know, there's a cliche about this - they can only hurt you, they can't really help you very much.",
        "What you want to do first is do no harm.",
        "You want to avoid somebody like a Geraldine Ferraro, who's going to blow up in your face because you didn't vet her well enough, or Dan Quayle, who also wasn't vetted well enough.",
        "So you want to vet them very well, and then, of course, you want to think about when to make the announcement.",
        "And my last question: timing.",
        "Before being deployed in September 2006, Hugo was studying nursing at Viterbo University in La Crosse, Wisconsin.",
        "Her classmate Juanita Davis(ph) says, as a student, Rachael didn't have to go to Iraq, but she wanted to look after her friends in the 303rd Military Police Company of the Army Reserves.",

        "But Terryl Brown Clemons says pervasive give-and-take now characterizes the entire music industry.",
        "Well, it's really interesting because before this, the Movement for Democratic Change has splintered into two different groups.",
        "Tsvangirai was leading one, and one of his former colleagues was leading the other.",
        "I think this has brought them together.",
        "And they're saying now that Mugabe is bigger than whatever problems that they have.",
        "And they have vowed to continue protesting, and they have vowed to continue by all - and they used this word -democratic means to defeat this government.",
        "So, it looks like they're planning to go back to the streets, and that could really bring Zimbabwe to an awful path, because Mugabe has let it be known that he will meet any kind of demonstrations like this, which he accuses the demonstrators are precipitating the violence - with violence, with force.",
        "As you know, I have a family in Zimbabwe, and when I came and visited, there was an unofficial exchange rate of ZWD 5,000 to one US dollar.",
        "Now, apparently, it's up to ZWD 8,000 to one US dollar, and that illustrates exactly what you're saying about the completely manic inflation rate.",
        "But I want to turn to another topic.",
        "Speaking of South Africa, you spoke of the exiles in South Africa.",
        "South Africa has been roundly criticized, especially by the international community, for not doing enough to stem the increasingly deadly toll that AIDS is taking on the nation.",
        "It's believed that one out of four South Africans is HIV positive.",
        "But now, after months of criticism, the government has launched what's being called the most dynamic and comprehensive plan it's ever put out, aimed at managing, at least, the AIDS epidemic.",
        "What they're hoping to do over the next four years is cut new infections by 50 percent.",
        "They also are saying that they're - in this new national strategic plan, they're bringing - trying to bring treatment to at least 80 percent of the HIV-infected people.",
        "It has to go one more step and get approval from the National AIDS Council before it is official.",
        "But, from what I can learn, that's just a matter - it's almost pro forma.",
        "The big challenge is that they're going to put in an estimated $3.3 billion, and they hope to put even more."

        "And people are saying, well, you know, where is this money going to come from?",

        "It never had any timetables.",
        "And this plan has goals and timetables.",
        "So, you know, everybody's got their fingers crossed, hoping that this will make a difference in a situation that is the most negative, I would say, of anything going on in South African - and the continent, for that matter.",

        "Why don't you give us a clue?",
        "Well, there is some good news.",
        "There was a new low-cost, anti-malarial drug launched in Paris a few days ago.",
        "And it is supposed to be one of the most effective combinations of drugs because it combines two drugs.",
        "I'm not going to begin to try and tell you what - how to pronounce those, but they are what they call a fixed-dose combination.",
        "And they've proven effective in the past in fighting malaria.",
        "What's cool about this is that the course of treatment for the new drug consists of just two pills a day for three days for adults, and most importantly, one pill a day for three days for children.",
        "Now malaria kills up to 3 million children in the world, mostly in Africa.",
        "They say more than a million children in Africa die from malaria each year, and 3,000 of those are under five.",
        "So this - what is also good about it, not only is it effective, but it's low cost.",
        "There's no patent on it, so generics can be made from it.",
        "And so it really does hold out the problem of a solution to something that has been a greater killer of children than AIDS.",
        "Well, Charlayne, it's great to hear about the resourcefulness of people in the face of adversity, and you bring us a lot of really compelling stories.",

        "For Obama, I think really has a kind of open field between now and the week before his convention in Denver, although if he wants to go on a vacation with his family and leave his vice president to do the campaigning, maybe he wants a good week with him, whoever it may be, on the trail before he does that.",
