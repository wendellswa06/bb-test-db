        "So when you walk close to it, it realizes that you're there, and then it sprays you with silly string.",
        "It has a servo, a little motor that presses down on the nozzle of the silly string and then sprays it out.",
        "And then to and you finalize the trick.",
        "It sends a wireless signal over to a computer that then tweets about it on the Web.",

        "What we've seen to date are Israeli measures that essentially are punishing the Palestinian population.",
        "They have not punished the people engaged in the kidnapping and who assaulted the IDO.",
        "The result of that has been a solidifying of support on the part of the population for the people who have done this.",

        "To your mind, what should they be doing instead?",
        "Well, it seems to me that if Israel cannot mount a military operation that would free the hostage, then they really do not have a choice other than two possibilities.",
        "The first one is to take a principal position and say, even though this may lead to the man's death by the terrorists, we cannot risk mounting an operation to free him.",
        "The other alternative is to enter into negotiations with them, as Sharon, for example, who certainly was not a softie, did not too long ago, when he turned over several thousand Palestinian prisoners and Lebanese prisoners who were in Israeli jails, in return for three dead Israelis and for one civilian.",
        "So, there is a precedent for having these exchanges and in fact it's an exchange that did not cause Israel in the long run any harm.",
        "Is it possible that from Israel's point of view that this is a diplomatic and military opportunity to strike at Hamas, an opportunity that they want to maximize?",
        "Well, the Israeli government for some time has tried to undermine the current Hamas government, the political wing of Hamas.",
        "And it has been very difficult for this government to function.",
        "It has now also arrested many in this government, the large part of the cabinet and a large proportion of the Palestinian Legislative Council.",
        "Now, they have said that - Israeli authorities, have said - that this is not related to the kidnapping, but clearly this is intended to put pressure on the kidnappers in the hope that they will yield their hostage in order to get these people back out of jail.",
        "But that's not going to happen.",
        "To the contrary, the people who are being jailed is, that's the culture of an occupied people, they are going to be seen as heroes and martyrs.",
        "What happens if Israel does strike at the heart of Hamas, topple the government, what then?",
        "Well, the expectation that Prime Minister Olmert and some of his ministers have, that if they bring down the Hamas government, it will be replaced by a more reasonable and more moderate government, mainly the Fatah Party.",
        "Now this raises two very obvious problems.",
        "The first one is that the expectation that the Palestinian public will have an election and bring back Fatah reveals an abysmal ignorance of the dynamics, the political dynamics in the Palestinian community."
