        "A lot of people haven't hard about these.",
        "Tell us about it.",
        "Yes.",
        "So an Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform, and it's really for designers and hobbyists who want to make interactive objects.",
        "And I'll say that another way, which is if you want to make something that interacts with someone and maybe turns on some lights or controls the motors or makes some sound, this is a little computer that makes it easy to do that.",
        "So you can hook up sensors like temperature sensors or buttons or air quality sensors, and then have them do something like turn on lights or control motors.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Yeah.",
        "We can make some stuff that really, really looks realistic.",

        "There's actually a mirror than you can make that will talk back to you.",
        "Yeah, this is what we call the DIY Magic Mirror.",
        "And so what it is, is it's a mirror that is - that has a screen behind it from an old laptop, and then it's hooked up such that when you get close, it plays some videos to tell you how fair you are, to tell you, you know, the weather or to, you know, give you a spook.",
        "And it looks very much like a magic mirror from the movies.",

        "But the gray areas of the picture are where you scrape the skin of the pumpkin down.",
