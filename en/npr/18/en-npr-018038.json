        "He's an advisor in disaster preparedness for the Pan American Health Organization.",
        "You mentioned, Ciro Ugarte, there were three major things that had to be in place that took a little while to get there.",
        "One was communications.",
        "What are the other two?",
        "Dr.�UGARTE: Including everything that has to come with transportation and to provide all the roads, airports, ports, et cetera.",
        "The airport was down because the control tower of the airport was down.",
        "There was no power.",
        "There was no availability of, let's say, all the means that you need to get all the things that comes in the planes.",
        "Also, the roads were blocked.",
        "So, all the logistics.",
        "And the third aspect was security.",
        "Security in Haiti is a big issue, and it was a big issue before the earthquake, and that's why the United Nations assigned that many soldiers there to help the Haitian authorities to maintain the peace in Haiti.",
        "So those three aspects were not in place and, up to now, in several locations, are not in place yet.",
        "That's why the support of the U.S., including all the mobilization of the Marines under the request of the government of Haiti and the U.N., are going to help, or are helping, and are going to provide some of these aspects that we are talking about.",
        "So the communications, the logistics and the security - those three aspects to provide any type of humanitarian aid.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "This is a typical email from Afua(ph) in Ann Arbor, Michigan.",
        "He says: I have seen people patiently waiting in their makeshift camps.",
        "I have seen people singing peacefully in the streets in spite of their dire situation.",
        "Meanwhile, I keep hearing concerns about security.",
        "Security, instead of just dropping supplies to people by any means necessary.",

        "Not help yourself to goods if the supplies are not getting through to your area?",
        "U.N.",
        "and the relief agencies should stop acting as if the Haitians are wild people who will attack their helpers.",
        "They're desperate, but I have not seen anything in the coverage to suggest they are ready to kill people coming to their rescue.",
        "Get the food, water and medicine to them by any means necessary, please."

        "Dr.�UGARTE: Exactly.",
        "And I agree with that, and I think that those two first aspects were not in place.",
        "One is the communications.",
        "You don't know where they are, how they are suffering and what are their needs, where are their priorities - especially, for example, for search and rescue in the urban areas.",
        "That is happening.",
        "Up to now, for example, only 120 people - even though that's only 120 people rescued, but even if that number is very low, it's a record for rescues after an earthquake.",
        "But the thing is that those two aspects, that they - all the roads were blocked.",
        "So to open the roads was another aspect that was not in place.",
        "Well, we've also heard from a lot of people of why not airlift in supplies?",
        "Why not use helicopters if the roads are such an encumbrance?",
        "Why can't you, especially in the effort to get out of Port-au-Prince, drop supplies from the air?",
        "Dr.�UGARTE: Yes, they did that in two occasions, at the beginning of the emergency, and the problem was the - all the population that was around, the (unintelligible) population, ran after the goods, and there was an increase in violence in those situations.",
        "So they stopped that because, well, the aid was not providing, well, let's say, calm to the population, but instead of that, fighting between each other.",
        "We also have an email from Claudine(ph), who asks: Why isn't the U.N.",
        "playing a better role in coordinating help in case of major disasters?",
        "It seems that every time aid comes at the wrong time, it's not what's needed, or it's wasted.",
        "We need a coordinating body with a well-rehearsed international chain of events that can be put in place with one phone call to a supervising U.N.",
        "agency.",
        "Every country would then call with what they have promised to offer, and it would be distributed rapidly and effectively every time.",
        "Do you have any answer for Claudine?",
        "Dr.�UGARTE: Yes, the United Nations is, well, the countries' body.",
        "It's not, as I say, independent body, and they report to the countries.",
        "And the other thing is that in the Americas, there is the Pan America Health Organization, also, that is - belongs to the countries.",
        "In the case - I will respond in the case of the health sector.",
        "All countries, before sending their aid to Haiti, contacted the Pan American Health Organization country offices to see what are the needs in the health sector.",
        "So we said we need surgeons.",
        "We need field hospitals, but (unintelligible) with this type of medicine with this type of health personnel.",
        "We need this type of equipment and medical supplies, et cetera.",
        "And so they can provide what is needed.",
        "Before, in any other disaster, when the country with all its will and goodwill sent its supplies, up to 80 percent of what has been sent is not useful at the time of the disaster.",
        "And it also is a burden for the emergency operations, because they cannot be used at the right time, but a population is expecting that that aid has to be distributed at the right time.",
        "But they don't have -that's another priority, because they don't need that.",
        "For example, this - youth clothes.",
        "That's a big example on that, and also blood.",
        "So you have that, but you cannot distribute that, because you don't -you have, first, to classify everything to provide all the means to have, for example, blood and all type of blood solutions at the right time, at the right temperature and the right (unintelligible) and to provide to the right hospital, et cetera.",
        "That is not in place.",
        "So even the field hospital were sent by the countries.",
        "They said okay, we are sending field hospitals.",
        "So they sent field hospitals from Israel, from Russia, from Spain - not from Spain - but from other countries, and most of those field hospitals are still waiting to be deployed, waiting to be operational."

        "There's this great deal of concern about that, and particularly around water and also sanitation, these makeshift camps that have formed - have not been formalized.",
        "Therefore, proper sanitation hasn't been put in, and as you can imagine that the likelihood of the outbreak of diseases such as diarrhea is just imminent.",
        "And, of course, this is a high risk for children and children under five and can kill them in a matter of hours, particularly if they're dehydrated.",

        "You know, as much as, of course, my heart goes out to all of the suffering and heartache that these people are experiencing, I really think that so much of the criticism and the impatience of my fellow Americans - sitting in their living rooms at home, generously donating their dollars - is really emblematic of that need we have in this country for instant gratification.",
        "And I don't think people are really understanding enough that everyone that's on the ground there is making the very best effort that they can in the face of practically insurmountable obstacles, and it's just the same need for instant gratification I see, you know, in criticisms of our current administration.",
        "You know, if it isn't done immediately, right now, this second, then it's, you know - then somebody is doing something wrong.",

        "It's difficult enough to try to get aid to people in countries that had an infrastructure in place.",
        "But in Haiti, the infrastructure was in shambles prior to the earthquake, and now many roads are nearly impassable.",
        "So, Ian Rogers, some support certainly for what you and other organizations are trying to do, of course, some of the frustration comes when you've got a little bit of a ticking clock on the difference between a rescue mission and a recovery mission."

        "But I think what's also different people have to understand is that this is one of - this is, certainly for me, the only disaster I have ever been in where it's been in the capital city and has significantly wiped out all of the government's services so it's very difficult for the Haitian country to even help itself.",

        "And they were the - are actual heroes of this emergency.",
        "And we are focusing a lot on international aid - I work for an international organization, but I want to praise the Haitian government, the Haitian people, the Haitian physicians, the Haitian nurses and personnel that did a great job and they are doing - they are dealing with thousands of wounded and - well, all (unintelligible) risks, and, fortunately, all those receiving in some support now from international organizations.",
        "But during the first 48, 72 hours, they acted alone and they did all they can.",
        "The other successful is - story is the coordination.",
        "Even though it is -remains a challenge, at least 70 organizations that are working in the health relief are linked between each other and trying not to compete with the others but to coordinate and to work altogether.",
        "And that is great.",
        "In several other disasters, I've seen - everyone on different institutions but trying to compete, for example, search and rescue teams to compete for a good building to be rescued or maybe an embassy or maybe a hotel or et cetera.",
        "In this case, the coordination is kind of flowing better than (unintelligible).",
        "And, Ian Rogers, are you seeing that with food and water and shelter coordination?",
        "Certainly.",
        "I mean, the coordination is trying to occur as much as possible.",
