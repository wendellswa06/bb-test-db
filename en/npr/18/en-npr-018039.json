        "The load that the rain will put on these buildings will mean that they'll come down further.",
        "There's a high, high chance of landslides due to the fact that the soil has cracked open, and once that water fills those cracks, it will turn around and break a lot of that kind of mud and debris away.",

        "In his introduction to Katz's book, \"\"The Art of Fermentation,\"\" food writer Michael Pollan says we've been living in an age of Purell.",
        "He calls fermentation, quote, \"\"an eloquent protest against the homogenization of flavors and food now rolling like a great, undifferentiated lawn across the globe.\"\" Katz says he wants to demystify fermentation so people won't be afraid.",
        "Then maybe we can all feel the magic."
