        "Good morning.",
        "So how serious is this threat of ISIS in Afghanistan right now?",
        "It's pretty serious, in part because people don't even know how many fighters there are in the country.",
        "Just today, a senior Afghan security official said there was probably around 2,000 fighters, but he was speaking in response to a Russian envoy who reportedly said there were 10,000 fighters in the country.",
        "Oh, whoa.",
        "Yeah, so you can see that even internally, there's a very vocal debate about how many fighters there are.",
        "And the other thing is - is that they seem to be shifting around the country.",
        "They're most active and present near the Pakistan border, but now local news in Afghanistan is saying that they've also established themselves way up north near the Turkmenistan border.",
        "That's quite a distance from Pakistan.",
        "But even if they're based in these places, are they mostly targeting and attacking Kabul at this point?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, these are at least the attacks that are most heavily covered by local media in Afghanistan, and that's for a good reason.",
        "ISIS is attacking the seat of government, and it's attacking the place where its allies - you know, Western powers - have based themselves.",
        "And so what it's showing these two forces is that it can still strike at, you know, their beating heart, even though they're being attacked quite relentlessly by, you know, dozens, if not hundreds, of airstrikes at this point.",
        "And keep in mind, some of these attacks are brutal.",
        "Some ISIS attacks have killed more than 20, more than 30, even more than 50 people at once."

        "Right.",
        "So I'm just going to be the bad-news fairy.",
        "Like, it's even more worrying when we look at who they're targeting.",
        "They're targeting security forces and security installations in Afghanistan.",
        "And what they're trying to do there, it seems, is lower already-eroding morale among Afghan security forces.",
        "They have high casualty rates, low retention rates, and this is a further incentive to give up the fight against ISIS.",
        "But the other group that they're targeting are Shiite civilians.",
        "ISIS has attacked their mosques around Afghanistan, and this risks further destabilizing Pakistan by triggering a sectarian conflict.",
        "And I was speaking to a local reporter in Afghanistan, Aziz Tasal (ph), and he was saying that he meets worshipers who are now afraid of going to Shiite mosques.",
        "And what that does is erodes people's, like, faith or even legitimacy in the government that's meant to protect them.",

        "Yeah, President Hassan Rouhani won and won big re-election to a second term earlier this year, and that 2015 nuclear deal could still mean good things for Iran's economy.",
        "But Rouhani is dealing with hard-liners at home, and the Trump administration, of course, is calling for the world to get tougher on Iran."
