        "But it's interesting advice because, for example, he says that Barack Obama has got to look Hillary Clinton in the eye.",
        "He says that too often even in the course of debates when he's trying to make a point, he doesn't look her in the eye.",
        "It looks as if he's afraid of her.",
        "And secondly, he says let people know that her candidacy is not inevitable and may be a bad thing for the Democratic Party, that the reason that Barack Obama has had such success, raised as much money as he has, is that lots of Democrats worry that she cannot win, I'm quoting here, that she'll be a drag on the ticket, and if she got to the White House, she'd be a disaster.",
