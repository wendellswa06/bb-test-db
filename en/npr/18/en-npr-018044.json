        "In recent years government scientists have documented polar bears drowning as they try to swim long distances in seas that can be very harsh.",
        "Andrew Wetzler of Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, says scientific research makes it clear polar bears should be listed as threatened.",
        "It's not a foregone conclusion that the polar bears will be listed, but the evidence supporting listing is simply overwhelming.",
        "It would be the first time climate change put a species on the threatened list.",
        "Wetzler says the implications could be dramatic.",
        "If polar bears are listed, the federal government is going to be obligated to take into account its actions which exacerbate global warming on the polar bear and other wildlife in the arctic US system in general and that's a great thing.",
        "This would be a huge departure from the way the government usually protects endangered species whose threats are generally close at hand.",
        "In theory, the federal government could deny a permit to a coal fired power plant in Ohio because its emissions would contribute to climate change and eradicating polar bears.",

        "December's jobless rate was the same as November's: 10 percent.",
        "But among African-Americans, unemployment increased by six-tenths of a percent to 16.2 percent.",
        "Coming up, a report on the unemployment problems black teenagers face, but first, many college-educated black professionals have been struggling to find jobs in recent months, partly because of the economy and partly because of corporate America's spotty relationship with race.",
        "Last month, The New York Times ran an article on African-Americans who've opted to, quote, \"\"whiten,\"\" unquote, their resumes to get a foot in the corporate door, because any indication of their race could be a roadblock to an interview.",

        "The New York Times article that ran last month saying some African-Americans have changed their names or omitted the name of their school if it was a historically black university.",
        "Is the concept of de-blacking a resume news to many African-Americans?",
        "No, not at all.",

        "You question whether the reason you haven't been getting any callbacks is because of what you list, because of your name or your organizations.",
        "So, considering the corporate culture in America, is this a necessary move?",
        "You know, I think it would be going too far to say that it's a necessary move because that would imply that every recruiter or corporation has that kind of a bias.",
        "But it is something that one has to think of, especially when they're entering the job market, because anything that makes you stand out probably, in a way that even distracts a little bit from your qualifications can just be a problem.",
        "But ultimately he's saying that she has shortcomings that would hurt the Democratic Party even as the playing field is tilted to the Democrats looking towards the '08 election.",
        "It is funny to read this because you see what a master of political dialogue Karl Rove really is.",
        "There is good advice for Barack Obama in there, and at the same time he's saying you're weak.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "He says that Obama is weak and that he's weak for failing to properly confront her.",
        "Well, Senator Obama and Senator Clinton, for that matter, can laugh off advice from Karl Rove.",
        "But they've both got to be looking at these polls in New Hampshire that do show him doing better there.",
        "He already has done well this week in polls in Iowa.",
        "What do you think of all this?",
        "Well, the key here is less Iowa than it is New Hampshire, Alex, because I think that Hillary Clinton, you know what, she could actually survive a loss in Iowa, but New Hampshire, if she is lost in Iowa and then doesn't come back in New Hampshire, there would be so much momentum for Barack Obama that it really would be a house on fire at that point and a problem for Hillary Clinton."

        "Fascinating speech because you know what was interesting to me, Alex, and I wonder how you feel about this, but he didn't want to give the speech.",

        "And he said all that would be bad for foreign relations.",
        "I was stunned that he would be so frank, and also surprised that they view and like the idea of George W.",
