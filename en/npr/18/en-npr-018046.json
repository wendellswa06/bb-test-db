        "Well, I asked Schumer this at a press conference that he did a little bit later, and he said their really only plan that they had was to go in and offer Trump a couple of options for keeping the government open and funding the Department of Homeland Security.",
        "He repeatedly said - Schumer repeatedly said that they went in there expecting this to be a closed-door meeting, not something with cameras present.",
        "And they really didn't expect to be fighting with the president in front of an audience of the whole country.",
        "But this is not the first time the president has made a meeting like this public, right, Mara?",
        "No, it's not.",
        "In the past, he has invited cameras in, and the idea is to show that he's in charge or he's making deals - bipartisan deals with members of Congress.",
        "But this time, it didn't work out like that.",
        "He looked like a man without a plan.",
        "He seemed to be backed into a corner by the Democrats to admitting, yes, I will shut down the government if I don't get what I want, which is quite unpopular.",
        "And he didn't really seem like he had a strategy for this meeting.",
        "And as we heard by the end, he said, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, accepting ownership of that.",
        "So, Kelsey, how does this change negotiations in Congress where you are?",
        "Well, it's really different than what Republicans were saying just a few hours earlier.",
        "House Speaker Paul Ryan and his House Republican counterparts were talking about a Schumer shutdown not even an hour and a half before this happened.",
        "And they basically can't claim that anymore.",
        "The president has said that if this - if a shutdown happens, it will be entirely on him.",
        "Now, that means that Republicans will have to convince him to change his position.",
        "And as we know, that is not something the president likes.",
        "He doesn't like to give up this moment of theater.",
        "But that's not how you usually negotiate things in Washington.",
        "And the other thing the president did is he toggled back and forth between saying, quote, \"\"a lot of the wall\"\" is already built; it's been very effective; it's cut illegal immigration by something like 92 percent in certain areas, which of course led to the Democrats saying, well, if it's already working, then you should take the money we're offering you, which is the same exact amount of money we offered you for border security last year.",
        "Right.",
        "What about the president's insistence that this vote could get through the House and the only reason he's not bringing it up in the House is because it couldn't get through the Senate 'cause it doesn't have Democratic support?",
        "Is that true?"

        "They also have been battling a group within their own party, a group of moderates, who would rather be dealing with, say, other parts of the legal immigration system.",
        "And, you know, this is not something that has full and total agreement within the Republican Party.",
        "And, you know, one of the most dramatic moments in this meeting was when Nancy Pelosi was schooling the president about whether or not he had the votes in the House.",
        "She said, you don't have the votes.",
        "He said, yes, I do.",
        "And we know who the better - who is the better vote-counter in that standoff.",

        "They actually think that this was good for Pelosi.",
