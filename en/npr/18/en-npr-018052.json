        "Yesterday, Vice President Cheney came down to cast a tie-breaking vote on a deficit reduction bill, then a group of mostly Democratic senators blocked passage of the defense appropriations bill, usually a must-pass measure, and forced the leadership to take out an amendment that would have allowed drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.",
        "Then last night, the Senate voted to extend the USA Patriot Act for six months.",
        "Earlier, the White House and the Republican leadership refused any delay on the Patriot Act, but grudgingly accepted the six-month deal.",

        "The House is going to meet today at 4:00 and ostensibly they will do a unanimous consensus to extend the Patriot Act for six months.",

        "But again, you know, we've seen people back down before and we could see it again.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And then on the defense appropriations bills, that would require the House of Representatives to strip out their version of the ANWR permission to go ahead and drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and, again, accept the Senate's obstreperousness",
        "Well, again--I mean, of course, people--whether it's a Democrat against Republican or Republicans against Republican, members of the House don't like to be dictated to by what the Senate does.",
        "But still, again, you know, there's been a lot of unease about ANWR in the House, as well.",
        "There are a lot of moderate Republicans who would like to see it go away and when they come back at 4:00, the defense bill will pass, again by voice--by unanimous consent without any debate.",

        "But that $40 billion in deficit reductions did go through.",
        "But talking about this friction that the president's been encountering in Congress the past several weeks, should we see this as cyclical, something Ken was talking about, this happens every time in a president's sixth term, or is this, to some degree, a response by some in Congress to what they perceive as presidential overreaching?",

        "His big schtick was to distinguish France as a kingdom from Burgundy, from southern France, from the dukedoms, and that's why French cuisine became part of a soft power diplomacy of trying to take over all of France and then later to broadcast things French abroad.",
