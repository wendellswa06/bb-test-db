        "So there might be fewer people working, but that was only because a lot of people were working because that's the only way they could get covered.",
        "Second, the part about the restaurant owner who said he has 60 workers and has to let 10 go, he's probably referring to the fact that the law will require employers with more than 50 workers to either provide health insurance or else pay a fee.",
        "Except that that requirement doesn't start until 2014 so it's a little bit odd that he's doing it this summer.",
