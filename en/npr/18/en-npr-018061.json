        "It's a vaccine that prevents cancer, but via a sexually transmitted disease, as Congressman Paul mentioned, so that does make some parents nervous.",
        "And it's recommended for preteen girls, not because they expect them to be having sex at that age, but because experts want them to be fully protected before they begin having sex.",
        "But that's often been misinterpreted, which has added to the controversy surrounding it.",
        "And we should note, Julie, that while there were several controversies surrounding this issue of the vaccine, in fact, the program never became law in Texas.",
        "That's right.",
        "The governor tried to do it by executive order and he was overridden by his legislature, so this mandate for vaccination didn't actually happen.",

        "Let's move on, then, to Governor Perry's reference to Galileo, who was once, he said, outvoted.",
        "Yeah.",

        "And I must say that astronomers of the day generally did agree with him, although there were some skeptics who didn't and his real conflict was, of course, with the Catholic church, which considered it a heresy that the Earth might not be the center of the universe.",
        "And, by the way, when Perry was asked to name a single scientist who he trusts on climate issues, presumably his Galileo, he demurred.",
