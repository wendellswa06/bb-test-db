        "Long made a calculated decision in how he spoke to his congregation over the weekend - not giving a lot of details, but promising to fight the allegations.",
        "This is difficult, difficult for everybody.",
        "This is probably the most difficult time in my entire life.",

        "Well, it went through the Senate and again, you know, Dick Cheney had to drive all the way from the Mideast to come from--other parts of the world to cast a tie-breaking vote.",
        "But because of some procedural matters, the Democrats made some changes and now Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in the House say they will not agree to an automatic vote today, a unanimous consent, so it'll be put off till next year.",
        "And by doing so, Pelosi and the Democrats will make some moderate Republicans take another uncomfortable vote on cutting things like Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, school lunches, things like that."

        "Right.",
        "Well, what you need to know is that Ted Stevens attached it to any vehicle he can.",
        "He tried to attach it to a budget bill, but moderate Republicans in the House wouldn't go along with it.",
        "They tried and--so it failed.",
        "Then he attached it to the defense spending bill and basically what happened was Democrats--he basically dared Democrats to vote against it.",
        "Given the fact that this is $453 billion for troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan in addition to hurricane aid and flu preparedness funds, Stevens attached it to this bill and dared Democrats to vote against it.",
        "And Democrats said, `Look, you know, we are not against the war'--I'm sorry, `We are not against drilling in ANWR, and how dare you suggest that by voting against this we are not backing our fighting soldiers across--around the world.",
        "What it is is that it's a breach of Senate politics and Senate rules to attach something to a must-pass bill.",
        "So Joe Lieberman, who's a big supporter of the war in Iraq, stood up essentially yesterday and said, `Look, this has nothing to do with--of course, I support the troops, but this is not the way to do it.",
        "And so what happened was Democrats and some Republicans filibustered the bill--filibustered it, and so it was--as long as it was part--as ANWR was part of this defense spending bill, it was not going to get passed.",
        "And then they had another rule which was the Rule 28, the Byrd rule, which basically they--I think by Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, voted to take ANWR out of the final bill and they did that by a 48-to-45 vote.",
        "Jennifer, Rule 28, there you go.",

        "Thank you.",
        "And I wanted to ask you about this broader question that I've been talking briefly with Ken about, and that is the president has encountered more legislative opposition I think in the past three or four weeks than he did in his entire term.",
        "That's right.",
        "And part of it is that he was extraordinarily successful in his first term in maintaining Republican unity.",
        "He had the war on terror, the war in Iraq, and that tends to unify political support.",
        "He also had the outcome of the 2002 midterm in which he regained his Senate majority.",
        "A lot of Republicans were grateful for that.",
        "He had a successful re-election, strengthened Republican majorities in both chambers.",

        "Well, I was going to say, plus the fact that you also see Republican leadership hurt in both the House and Senate.",

        "So the leadership--the Republican leadership in both the House and Senate is proving wanting.",
        "And, Jack Pitney, I guess we can't leave that litany without mentioning the negotiations that are apparently under way right now with Jack Abramoff and his attorneys, who may agree to a guilty plea, at least that's the speculation here in Washington, and that's something that has a lot of members of Congress deeply worried.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Nobody is quite sure whom Abramoff is going to name, what kind of accusations that will come up with it, possibly indictments.",

        "But as the war drags on, the separation of powers kicks in and members of Congress start to question the administration, and that's true both in the case of the war in Iraq and the war on terror.",

        "The administration pointing out on several occasions, `Hey, you all voted for the Patriot Act when it was approved.",

        "That's right.",

        "We've seen Republicans striking back by pointing out Harry Reid was present at the signing of the Patriot Act.",
        "We see a lot of references to the acts of previous presidents in supporting warrantless searches.",
        "So there's going to be a lot of back-and-forth on that, and the key question for members of Congress is the reaction of the public.",
        "When it comes to issues of national security, are they going to side with Congress or the president?",

        "Well, that's a very good question, because now the schedule as it stands right now, the House is not scheduled to come back until January 31st, missing the entire month of January.",
        "And most people are saying the reason the Republican leadership has left open the month is so Tom DeLay could somehow be acquitted of what's going on in Texas 'cause he's under indictment there.",

        "Right.",
        "The Travis County, Austin, district attorney, right.",
        "Even if he's exonerated in that case, he--the worst-case scenario for the Republicans is that he beats the case, comes back to Washington, is welcomed by open arms by his Republican colleagues, he's reinstated as majority leader, then--Boom!--he gets indicted or caught up in the Jack Abramoff mess.",
        "So the Republicans are very nervous about what to do there.",
        "There's a leadership vacuum clearly in the House, and there are maybe a handful but they're a growing handful of those who say, `Let's not wait for Tom DeLay anymore.",

        "They have not exactly electrified America, either.",
        "No.",
        "They've done a skillful job procedurally in Congress, especially in the past week in throwing up roadblocks to legislation they don't like.",
        "What they haven't done yet is put together a clear and consistent message on the issues.",
        "And Nancy Pelosi has been on record as saying that the party doesn't need a clear and consistent message when it comes to Iraq.",
        "That may or may not prove true in the 2006 election if public opinion turns even more against policy in Iraq.",
        "Then the Democrats could benefit even if they don't have a unified message.",
        "But there is a large faction of the party that wants to be for something and not just against something, and that's one layer of conflict that the Democrats have to contend with."
