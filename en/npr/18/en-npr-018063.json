        "This is Robert, Robert's calling us from Somerville, Massachusetts.",
        "Hi.",
        "How are you?",
        "Very well, thank you.",
        "Mr.",
        "Speaker - Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor and great pleasure to nominate Donald J.",
        "Trump for the office of president of the United States of America.",
        "I just have a question about whether your guests think we're moving towards a real realignment.",
        "Because the Republican Party that I grew up being aware of was opposed to deficit spending, opposed to government intrusion and really, really shape on issues of civil liberties and defending them, opposed to foreign adventurism.",
        "And now you see that all of those sort of principles that the Republican Party seemed to be based on, it's kind of like `never mind.",
        "So I'm wondering is that a short-term thing, or are we really seeing the Republican Party transform into something very different than what it stood for 10 or 15 years ago?",
        "Jack Pitney.",
        "Well, if you go back in the 1980s, you found record-high deficits under the Reagan administration.",
        "You also found a lot of activism overseas in places such as Nicaragua and El Salvador.",
        "And many of the accusations being leveled against the current Bush administration were leveled against the Reagan administration.",
        "And so the debate has a very familiar tone to it.",
        "And also, if you remember in 1994 when the Republicans were trying to and ultimately were successful in recapturing Congress, they said, `Look, there's a culture of corruption among these Democrats in Congress.",
        "You've got to vote them out after 40 years of, you know, autocratic and unresponsive rule.",
        "You have to--we have to stop this wasteful spending.",
        "Well, lo and behold, 10 years later, you have Republicans in control of Congress with record deficits and there's no shortage of corruption, either.",
        "So it's--I don't know if there's a realignment among Republicans, but there's certainly something about a party that gets into power and then what they do with that power.",
        "But Robert's point is there are certainly elements of the Republican Party--and you think of Mike Pence, the congressman from Indiana--who are deficit hawks and very unhappy with the way a lot of these measures have been approved by Congress.",
        "Absolutely true.",
        "And look at the record.",
        "President Bush has yet to veto any kind of measure; no veto at all.",
        "And so if the president says he's very unhappy about the huge spending requests by Congress, well, use that veto pen, and he has not so far."

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And we're talking about Republicans, who control both houses of Congress and the White House, as if they're in power because they are.",
        "And, Jack Pitney, let me raise another point about that, and that is unhappiness by some Republicans as well about all of the pork in the transportation bill that just seem to be out of whack this time around.",
        "That's right.",
        "If you were to weigh the transportation bill in the amount of pork is measured that you could find at the supermarket, it would come to about 200 pounds for every man, woman and child in the United States.",
        "There's an old saying among staffers on Capitol Hill, `They're incumbents first and Republicans second.",
        "Members of Congress want to get re-elected, and re-election involves servicing the constituencies.",
        "And we'll see that under both Republicans and Democrats.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But as Republicans try to expand their base and become the natural party of government, as a lot of Republicans strategists try to paint them over these past several years, Ken Rudin, as they've tried to expand that base--well, if you do that, you then incorporate a number of elements that are not necessarily happy with where the mainstream is going along.",
        "It's a less-disciplined party.",
        "But you know, that's true about the Democrats, too.",
        "When the Democrats were in the wilderness, losing the McGoverns and the Mondales and the Dukakises and along comes Bill Clinton and he brings the Democrats out of the wilderness and yet there were so many Democrats that said, `What do we stand for?",
        "He's more conservative than he should be, he's tough on welfare, he's tough on crime.",
        "I mean, he's Republican lite.",
        "And so, therefore, what do we stand for?",
        "Both true believers in the Democratic and Republican Party have this gnawing uneasiness that once you get in power, you just have to reach ...(unintelligible), you have to reach for a majority, and in doing so, you lose your core values.",
        "So, Robert, anywhere in there did we answer any of your questions?",
        "Yeah, I think so.",
        "I mean, maybe I'm thinking--you know, I'm almost 50, and I'm thinking about the Republican Party of, you know, Barry Goldwater and Reagan before he got power and just how really aggressive they were about the idea of small government, about keeping--you know, protecting individual liberties, about making sure there were no intrusions and how they trace that to, you know, early American history.",
        "And I just feel like we've completely somehow lost that, and now it's, `Yeah, yeah, we're for all that except that now we're for--we have a war and so forget all those principles and now we're going to spend through the roof and do whatever we like on civil liberties.",
        "And it's kind--I'm not a Republican, but I must say I'm kind of surprised that there's such a speedy abandonment of those principles.",
        "That's what it looks like to me.",
        "Well, I'm not sure everybody's abandoned them.",
        "But anyway, Robert, thank you very much for the call.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Let's talk now with Sherry, Sherry's calling us from San Diego.",
        "Hi, there.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "This is not the first time Senator Frist has inserted this language into bills.",
        "He's inserted it probably five or six times, starting with the homeland security bill, and it actually had to be removed from the bill in 2002.",

        "That's the version that the Senate objected to earlier this week over that provision on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.",
        "A very unusual time, Ken Rudin, to try to get something out because you can't amend a bill once it's out of--once it's a conference report.",
        "Right.",
        "And I'm not sure if Sherry's asking whether lawmakers in the House, for example, can take that out, because basically they won't 'cause they're going to approve the bill today at 4:00, again by unanimous consent, with no recorded vote.",
        "If Sherry's asking whether there's any recourse for regular citizens to--I'm not sure.",

        "One analogy would be President Reagan.",

        "Even in his second term, he had the tax reform bill of 1985, 1986.",
        "But in the 1986 midterms, Democrats retook control of the Senate and his congressional support scores as measured by Congressional Quarterly fell to record lows.",

        "Bush did have, for the most part, control of the House and Senate, a comfortable control of the House and Senate, for most of his presidency.",
        "Given the fact that he had stratospheric ratings following 9/11, given the fact that they picked up seats in 2002 and was re-elected in 2004, he came into office--I think the day he was re-elected, he said, `I have political capital and I intend to use it.",
        "And yet the things he really wanted, like the permanent tax cuts and overhaul of Social Security and ANWR, none of that seems to be happening.",

        "Of course, they both had major-league scandals at the time called Watergate and Iran-Contra.",
        "There's some fuss about warrantless searches authorized by the president of the United States, but that's nothing approaching either of these other two situations.",
        "No, at least not at the current time.",
        "We'll see if there are hearings at the beginning of 2006.",
        "There may be revelations that get the public's attention in a way that they haven't so far.",
        "In 1974, the Republicans took a shellacking in the midterm election, but people who've looked at that have found it actually had a lot more to do with the recession of 1974 than with Watergate.",
        "One source of hope for the Republicans, and we saw this in the news broadcast just before this program, is that the economic news is generally pretty good.",
        "So that doesn't mean that Republicans are out of danger, but one source of danger that's lurked in the past isn't there yet.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And, Ken Rudin, another concern for particularly members--Republicans in the House of Representatives is the Supreme Court's willingness now to review the redistricting case in Texas that gave the Republicans, well, effectively five more seats.",
        "True, but I mean if the question is whether Tom DeLay and the Republicans were overly partisan in drawing lines, well, that argument gets thrown out immediately because Democrats have been doing that for years, and one of the reasons that Democrats had such control of the House of Representatives for 40 years was because of the control of the redistricting process.",
