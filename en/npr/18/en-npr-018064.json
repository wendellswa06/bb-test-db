        "And one of the reasons the Democrats in the House are very eager to have that vote postponed, the vote in the House, until next year is because they want to point out the fact that not only is Congress about to cut programs for the poor, but they're about to give tax rebates to the rich, and especially in an election year that could damage Republican hopes.",
        "And again, we call them cuts in programs for the poor even though what they're doing is restraining the growth, how quickly the programs grow, though it would cause people to be cut off the rolls.",

        "It will be a battle, but again the Republicans will say if you look at the economics, what's going out there with jobs and job creation and, you know, numbers, the economy is picking up, and I think President Bush's recent poll surge is showing that.",
        "So they are trying to make the case that the economic plan that Bush instituted in 2001 is working, but again, Democrats will gladly show that the cuts in Medicaid, Medicare and school lunches and things like that and say, `No, it's not the way to go.'",
