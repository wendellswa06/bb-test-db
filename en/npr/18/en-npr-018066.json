        "Well, I think--it didn't exactly create a sea change immediately but over the years it certainly has.",
        "And I think the key is that for Whitman, the development of an absolutely new style, a style so radical, so open, so flowing, the free verse lines, the brash announcement of a strong self that would sing of itself, all of these things led to a remarkably strange and radical book that when reviewers, except for Whitman himself, first looked at it, reviewers would talk about it not even being a book of poems, being unable to really decipher what it was.",
        "The form was so strange and radical.",
        "Many of the ideas were familiar from writers like Ralph Waldo Emerson, who sent Whitman a letter early on and greeted him at the beginning of a great career and helped Whitman along.",
        "Whitman took that phrase from Emerson's letter without permission and emblazoned it on the second edition of \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\" in 1856.",
        "As you mentioned, he was a great self-promoter...",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "...and if he had lived in a time where publication dates were announced, as they are today, he certainly, I think, would have announced his book to have appeared on July 4th.",
        "Unfortunately, that's a bit of wishful thinking now.",
        "It didn't really get published on July 4th?",
        "No, it didn't.",
        "That was an argument that was made by a critic who really wanted it to happen back in the 1930s and he made the argument on the basis of the dates that advertisements for \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\" that Whitman had placed in New York area newspapers appeared, but since then we've found earlier advertisements from as early as late June that were advertising the book already available in the bookstores."
