        "We're talking about \"\"Leaves of Grass.\"\" When Walt Whitman first published these poems 150 years ago, one review called them `a mass of stupid filth,' while another cheered `an American bard, at last.",
        "Of course, the author of that second quote was Whitman himself in an anonymous review.",
        "A century and a half later what's your relationship to \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\"?",

        "Our guest is Ed Folsom, editor of the Walt Whitman Quarterly Review and co-director of the Walt Whitman Online Archive.",
        "Professor Folsom, I'm wondering if there is any verse in the first edition of \"\"Leaves of Grass\"\" that you think particularly captures Walt Whitman's spirit?",
        "Well, it's always difficult to pull out a particular passage but the nice thing about Whitman is you can almost never go wrong.",
        "You can pick out any passage and it begins to unfold into all the other passages of \"\"Leaves of Grass.\"\" It's a tremendously organic work in that sense.",
        "Here's a passage I'm fond of from the poem that he eventually entitled \"\"Song of Myself.",
        "(Reading) I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise.",
        "Regardless of others, ever regardful of others.",

        "At home on Canadian snowshoes or up in the bush or with fishermen off Newfoundland.",
        "I resist anything better than my own diversity and breathe the air and leave plenty after me and am not stuck up and am in my place.",
        "You know, Walt Whitman set out in this work--he really wanted to appeal--not only was he democratic in the writing of his poetry, he really wanted the widest range of people to read his poetry.",
        "It must have been a pretty bitter disappointment, I would think, when so few people actually were interested in his poetry, at least in the first go-round.",
        "Yes, I think that's true and Whitman, you know, when he wrote the 1855 \"\"Leaves of Grass,\"\" at the last minute he added a preface to--a prose preface to the poems explaining what--in many ways what he was trying to accomplish in the poetry.",
        "And he ended that preface by saying `The proof of a poet is that his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it.",
        "And I think when he wrote that line he began--he really set for himself a pretty high bar; that is, that the success of his poetry would actually be measured by the affection with which his country would absorb him.",
        "He would become the American bard only if America absorbed him.",
        "He later dropped that line and--when he reprinted the preface--because I think he began to see that the absorption that he dreamed of was going to take a lot longer than he had hoped.",
        "You know, when he printed the second edition of \"\"Leaves of Grass,\"\" the 1856 edition, he--instead of putting it in the large page format of the first edition, he put it in a very small pocket-size format because he dreamed that the working men and working women of America would be carrying it in their pockets and reading it on their lunch breaks on their jobs.",
        "Whitman, by the end of his life, realized that it was going to be a slow process but he already, by the end of his life, was seeing the signs that a lot of young, very passionate readers were beginning to spread the word, to keep the books in print, to see that the 20th century would have an opportunity to read Whitman.",
        "And when he died in the early 1890s I think he was fairly secure in the notion that his work would have a chance.",
        "Well, most fans of Whitman read and reread his work.",
        "Dedicated aficionados may make a pilgrimage to his birthplace in West Hills, New York, but Ed Centeno has gone one step beyond.",
        "He has sacrificed a significant amount of his free time to collect advertising and other pop cultural artifacts which bear Whitman's image.",
        "Mr. Centeno is with us now by phone from his home in North Granby, Connecticut.",
        "Thanks for being with us."
