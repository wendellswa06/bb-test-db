        "It was sort of seen as scandalous when we talked about it in class, but to me it was affirming and allowed me to go on to read other poems and poets like Dickinson or Adrienne Rich or Audre Lorde and even other prose like Michael Cunningham, for example.",

        "What's your reaction to this caller's take on his exposure to Walt Whitman and how it affected him?",
        "I think it's an experience that many, many, many people have had reading Whitman over the years, and I think Billy's experience, too, of having read Whitman or having been taught Whitman without having Whitman's sexuality brought up in any way is an all-too-common experience as well.",
        "I think that's changing a bit now, and certainly in our culture, in American culture, Whitman--it's an odd way to put it, but Whitman became gay after the Stonewall revolution in the '70s.",
        "He was considered a gay poet in Germany, for instance, at the turn of the century, and there were those who were talking about Whitman's homosexuality in the 19th century.",
        "But in this culture, it really was kept out of the main discussions about Whitman for many years.",
        "Michael Cunningham, was that part of your own reaction to the reading of Walt Whitman?"

        "It's an epic poem about all people, and it doesn't stint on gay people.",

        "That's a very, very good question.",
        "The significance of the title is that I think Whitman viewed the leaves of grass--and I think we've got to remember what grass was in Whitman's time as opposed to the chemically enhanced lawns of today; grass was a wild variety.",
        "And if you think of the prairie grasses, which Whitman always loved to look at and think about, it was a vast variety of grasses that somehow grew together and the root systems intertwined, and so you had this amazing image of a vast plain of individuals that formed this prairie.",
        "And in some ways, that was Whitman's conception of the country.",
        "Leaves of Grass\"\" also had to do with Whitman's basic conception that it's a cycle of life and death that we live in and that death is continually pushing forward new life, and therefore death is not something to be mourned or feared, but rather something to be celebrated as part of that endless cycle of life and death.",
        "And \"\"Leaves of Grass,\"\" in the poem, the first long poem that becomes \"\"Song of Myself,\"\" leaves of grass become that image of the life growing out of the graves and the sustenance for a new cycle of life.",

        "He had a very rudimentary education, a public school education in Brooklyn that lasted until he was about 12 years old.",

        "And, Michael Cunningham, just one last question: To what extent do you think American writers have to, in some way, sort of confront the influence of Walt Whitman?",
        "Oh, I think American writers should not confront the influence of Whitman, but absorb it, rejoice in it and be grateful for everything he's given us, which is, to me, anyway, this sense of sort of limitless scope, the idea that there was nothing in the world, not one thing, that you can't write about, and that there is nothing ordinary in the world; there are only inadequate ways of looking at it.",
