        "According to the government's own Sasohn report, more than 100 new unauthorized outposts have been built in the West Bank since 1996.",
        "The report says most have basic infrastructure provided with help from the state.",
        "The first Israeli settlements in the West Bank began cropping up in the fall of 1967 — just a few months after the Six Day war.",
        "Over the years, bombings and shootings have turned Islamabad into a city of forts and roadblocks.",
        "Yet, behind the razor wire, there's more going on than you'd think.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF CROWD CHATTER)",
        "Israeli historian Gershom Gorenberg says back then, there were warnings at the highest levels within the government that settlements would be viewed by some as neocolonial occupation and could backfire.",
        "But parliamentary proponents of settlement consistently won out.",
        "The romanticized allure of settlement, Gorenberg says, was hard to stop.",
        "It was the way Jews in the late 19th century returned to their homeland before independence.",
        "And so it had this sort of, you know, log cabin, frontier mystique, or the equivalent of that in Israeli terms.",
        "And people who settled the land were heroes.",
        "But in 1967, this was an anachronism.",
        "It was this out of date ideal that when applied to the post-'67 reality, led Israel into a quagmire.",
        "Today, the Israeli government on the one hand concedes that Migron and the other outposts like it are illegal and contrary to established government policy.",
        "Yet at the same time, the government has actively supported their development and so far has done little to remove them.",
        "That's a pattern that began in the summer of 1967.",
        "What it reflects is that the conflict between the rational understanding that settlement is destructive for Israel and the emotional, almost mythical romance with settlement has not been resolved.",
        "Polls here show that a majority of Israelis have increasingly soured on the mystique of settlement and no longer believe they'll be able to hold on to the majority of West Bank land captured 40 years ago.",
        "Yet, near daily rocket fire from Gaza Strip — from which Israel unilaterally withdrew two summers ago — has made Israelis more fearful than ever of implementing a West Bank pullout.",
        "As one analyst here put it, the incredible irony is that at a time when the majority of Israelis have finally reached a conclusion it's impossible to stay in the West Bank, they're terrified of what the divorce will bring."
