        "It was even in mentioned in a press around that time that it was really - he was treated very poorly as a juvenile, and as he grew up, and I knew he was in and out of jail, in and out of juvenile institutions, in and out group homes.",
        "I just almost - I had - I was fixated in my mind just what he would look like.",
        "What would the 20-something-year-old, you know, grandson of Malcolm X look like, and my initial question about mine was, does he look like his grandfather?",
        "And that's the question, you know, Aliyah and I kind of threw around to each other, and I think, you know, the legacy is so kind of - almost frightening, because now he is 23-years old and the first - you know, his life so far is almost mirrored his grandfather's life to the point, you know, where they came from disadvantagd and troubled homes and spent a lot of their formative of years incarcerated, and the similarities to what that means, you know, 40 years later, to have such a similar experience with something that, you know, we're evolving or Aliya's evolving in her relationship with Malcolm over time.",

        "I asked him that question directly, not when he was in prison, but afterward we met several times, and at point blank I asked him, have you made your peace with what happened to your grandmother?",
        "And he said with very clear eyes, and a very strong demeanor, he said, \"\"Yes, I have forgiven myself, it was an accident, I did not mean to hurt my grandmother, and I know that for a fact.",
        "And he doesn't always speak in those kind of absolutes, but I remember that standing out to me, that this young who is a very young, was very clear on that.",
        "That he definitely has forgiven himself, although other people have not.",
        "When you say other people have not, it does include his family?",
        "Absolutely, I mean, I think, it's over due for us to have an opportunity, and some of your work has really spoken to this, that there is so many stories that - are African-American stories, but are American stories, and so many figures and identities that I think, you know, are constantly evolving into - you know, to find someone that can really teach us a lot about who we are as a culture, and who we are as an American society, and in so many angles - I mean, there is of the angle of being incarcerated"
