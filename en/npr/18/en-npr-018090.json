        "For the last two years, Sperling's been an adviser to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.",
        "He helped broker the tax cut compromise with Republicans during the lame-duck session of Congress.",
        "Some liberals don't like that compromise or the big paycheck Sperling received from Goldman Sachs in 2008.",
        "Dean Baker, of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, also believes Sperling's commitment to deficit reduction is misplaced, when the real problem now is unemployment.",
        "You've had this focus on the deficit that just is completely out of line with the reality, and I worry that, you know, Gene is one of the people that I won't say ascribes to that 100 percent, but I think ascribes to that maybe 70 percent.",
        "In that 2006 speech, Sperling described himself as a pro-growth progressive, which means he's concerned with both the size of the economic pie and the way it's divided up."
