        "The House this afternoon passed a war supplemental bill totaling $97 billion.",
        "Earlier, in the House Appropriations Committee, Democrat John Murtha noted that the Pentagon gets nearly four percent more than requested.",
        "Total of 78.4 billion in defense title, an increase of 4.9 billion above the request.",
        "That includes $3 billion for transport planes the Pentagon didn't want.",
        "Murtha is famous for his earmarks.",
        "He's got 69 of them cued up for this year's crop of spending bills.",
        "He's always directed federal money to companies in his Pennsylvania district and in past years to companies that used a particular lobby firm - the PMA Group.",
        "PMA hired the aides of key Democratic appropriators.",
        "It generated copious campaign contributions for the lawmakers themselves.",
        "Now it's out of business and the FBI has boxes of its papers.",
        "Plenty of people think this looks like corruption.",
        "There are two tracks for pursuing it.",
        "One would be a probe by the House Ethics Committee.",
        "The House just awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in the form of no-bid contracts to companies whose executives and their lobbyists turned around and contributed tens of thousands of dollars to members of Congress who secured those no-bid contracts.",
        "Arizona Republican Jeff Flake presenting a resolution for an investigation.",
        "He's tried this eight times and always lost the vote.",
        "Although this week, 29 Democrats sided with him.",
        "But no House member has done the one thing that would guarantee action: write a letter to the Ethics Committee requesting an investigation.",
        "Mike Fraioli, a consultant with connections to many House Democrats, says Flake really wants a fishing expedition.",
        "If he believes he has a specific complaint, then he ought to make it.",
        "Besides Murtha, Indiana Democrat Peter Visclosky had deep connections to PMA.",
        "It produced much of his substantial campaign treasury.",
        "Now Visclosky has purged his earmarks list of all PMA clients.",
        "He's begun voting for Congressman Flake's ethics resolutions.",
        "But that's politics.",
        "Legally speaking, the PMA case might be smoke with no fire.",
        "I asked Washington defense attorney Stanley Brand to walk through it.",
        "When you look back, James Othmer, over some of the classic ad battles of the past, you know, beyond cell phone wars when you look back - I'd say Coke versus Pepsi - do you see similarities?",
        "Or do you see lessons that would apply as these two companies do get out now?",
        "This one is interesting because it has a lot of complexity to it because you're talking about a partnership with another brand.",
        "You're talking about price, speed, network capabilities, the esthetic and technological-wow factor of the gadget.",
        "All of these things are incorporated into an ultimate brand choice or - I even - I'm reluctant to use the word brand loyalty because I think here, so much has to do with performance."

        "So here you have a churn with your customer base and a lot of different factors.",
        "Coke versus Pepsi is a parody product for the most part, you know, certain differences and taste.",

        "And I think consumers like those kind of battles because it wasn't real ugly.",
        "It was more in good fun.",
        "Well, and it's easy to use both - the same minute and decide what you like best.",
        "Really, it's so easy to switch between...",
        "Sure.",
        "And, you know, Apple versus Mac - Apple versus the PC is a similar thing.",
        "I think people have quite a bit of fun with that, although it's gotten quite - you know, very ugly.",
        "And the 1984 Apple spot could probably be looked at as the first salvo in that war.",
        "It ran during the Super Bowl.",
        "It only ran once, but it sort of positioned PC Microsoft users as these kind of George Orwellian drones.",
        "So that staked some territory for Mac back then, and they're still going at it today.",

        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "Our pleasure.",
        "What do you think?",
        "Well, I was just going to say that I think that consumers ultimately pay the price because, you know, you get both sides saying we're the best.",
        "And, you know, for something cheap like Coke or Pepsi, you can taste both and then make a choice.",
        "But for something more expensive like a PC or a Mac, it's kind of tough to make that decision.",
        "So - and yeah, yeah.",
        "You were saying it got pretty ugly.",
        "I had big time arguments with friends and professors about how, you know, oh, Mac versus PC.",
        "And it was getting pretty ugly at one point.",
        "So I think that both have good things and both have bad things.",
        "So it's kind of a toss up to me.",
