        "In Texas, sometimes teachers aren't allowed to fail students, and I think that by placing our students in a situation like that, we're setting them up for individual failure in the real world, where they aren't given too many second chances, and setting our country up for economic - I guess we're not going to be as competitive as we could be by not giving our students the best education.",

        "And what states have been doing, unfortunately, is actually lying, lying to children, lying to families.",
        "And when a child hears they're quote-unquote \"\"proficient,\"\" or you know, on track or on grade level, I think most students, most parents would logically assume, well, if I'm on track, I must be on track for later success in college and careers.",
        "And in fact, those standards have been dummied-down so much that students who are, you know, on track are often barely able to graduate from high school and are totally, woefully inadequately prepared for college.",
        "And as you said eloquently, we do our children and our country a grave disservice when we do that.",
        "So what we're seeing in a very short amount of time is huge leadership by states, by governors, by state school chief officers, by superintendants and boards around the country."
