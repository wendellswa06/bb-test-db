        "But as we move forward next fiscal year and the year after that, we're going to keep coming back and funding more.",
        "But what I heard as I talked to governors and state school chief officers of states who applied and didn't receive money is, yes, they're disappointed and they would've loved the money, but what they said is going through the process itself has made us much better.",

        "And lots of folks thought we were crazy to fight for it, that it would never happen, but it was simply the right thing to do, and we were so thrilled to see that actually come to fruition and prove all the doubters wrong, that we could really do something positive.",
        "So we don't want to see class size at 40.",
