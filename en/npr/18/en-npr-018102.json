        "Amen.",

        "And one of the things, if we want to get dramatically better results, you can't get dramatically better results by keeping doing the same thing.",

        "You're going to perpetuate the status quo.",

        "So we need new ideas.",
        "We need to innovate.",
        "We also need to share what is working.",

        "I wanted to ask you - well, to start off, Wilson's one of Washington, D.C.'s largest, most diverse and academically rigorous public high schools.",
        "And diversity is our strength so - and based on No Child Left Behind, we're a failing - we've been a failing school for the past seven years.",
        "And since we're so diverse, there are 34 areas we are judged on.",
        "If you fail one or two, you're a failing school.",
        "Yet if you pass - if you take a test and you missed that one question, then you still get a A.",
        "Does No Child Left Behind punish diversity?",
        "That's a great question.",
        "I think No Child Left Behind - much that needs to be fixed, and that's one of the real challenges.",
        "So let me just take one minute on this one, because this is hugely important.",
        "I think the current law is far too punitive.",
        "If you said there are about 50 ways to fail and almost no rewards for success, it is very prescriptive.",
        "It's very top down from Washington.",
        "I think that, fundamentally, doesn't work.",
        "It is led and I talked about that earlier.",
        "I think there's an unintended consequence, but still led to dumbing down of standards.",

        "Can you tell me - is your graduation rate going up or down for the school?",
        "I think it's been going up so far.",
        "So, to me, that's hugely important.",
        "Let me give you example.",
        "If your drop-out rate today is 80 percent, but it used to be 90 percent, you've got so many things to work on.",

        "And so, again, I want to look in improvement.",

        "Are more students successfully staying in college?",
        "And I think we have to get away from looking at one test score.",
        "What are attendance rates?",
        "Is violence going down, is discipline rates going down?",
        "We have to be much more comprehensive and look at a whole set of indicators and be much more thoughtful about it.",
        "We also have to raise standards, which has happened around the country.",
        "And the biggest thing is, we have to give everyone of you a well rounded education.",
        "So reading and math, English and math are hugely important, but so is science, so is social studies, so is foreign languages, so is financial literacy, so is environmental literacy.",
        "We have to get back to a well rounded curriculum.",
        "And so much of No Child Left Behind, I think, doesn't work.",
        "And we're looking to work with congressmen a bipartisan way, Republicans and Democrats together, to fix that very, very soon.",

        "But I am allowed to drop out of school and join the military, but I can't decide on my own educational future, even though I'm 18 years old."
