        "When I'd listen to educators or the politicians at the local, state and government level, we - all I hear is how can we improve education and get those kids to AP or honors in classes.",
        "And I hear nothing about helping those who have a learning disability or how are you going to improve the special education classes.",
        "Considering that I am in special ed - and pretty much, the teachers -they're pretty there to babysit us, not to teach us.",
        "How are you or the state, the local municipalities, are you going to help us with learning disabilities, whether we have dyslexia or any other kind of disabilities to help us gain, you know, or enrich our education?",
        "So my simple goal, to articulate, is much harder to do, is that we want every single child in this country to fulfill their true academic and social potential.",
        "And I think, Mike, there are students like you, whether it's a student with special needs, whether it's an African-American, Latino student, or Native American student, there are many students today who, frankly, we're not put in a position to fulfill your tremendous potential.",
        "And, again, that's why I feel this huge sense of urgency.",
        "And so, the idea of babysitting a child in school is one that's - yeah, that's not what this is about.",
        "I mean, that - that's how I - you know, I know when I'm growing up in elementary school, the special education teacher would yell at all of us because we didn't understand what she was talk - they were talking about, especially in high school.",
        "I'm ready to graduate and I don't even know if I'm prepared or not, for college - to even go to a community college.",
        "You know, I think every child - again, regardless of the ability or disability, every child has unique gifts.",
        "They have unique talents.",
        "And it's our job, as educators, to find those and help you fulfill them.",
        "Students learn in many different ways, and having teachers to be able to differentiate instruction and help that student who has dyslexia, give them the additional supports they need.",
        "And there are so many extraordinarily talented folks around in leadership roles, in government around the country, frankly, who have dyslexia.",
        "And they had those adults in their lives who help them challenge that and do very, very well.",
        "But when we don't do that, we do you, and we do the country a great disservice.",
        "And you articulate the goal, clearly.",
        "What are you going to do to make that come about?",
        "There's not one thing.",
        "It's a number of things.",
        "It's putting in place the teacher training and the professional development to be able to identify every student's strength and weaknesses.",
        "Would the federal government pay for that?",
        "We have huge money behind professional development that, frankly, isn't always use well.",
        "So the amount of $10 billion we put into different types of training.",
        "It is recruiting that next generation of talent.",
        "And to me, again, it's not just special education.",
        "I think every child should have a set of goals that the child and that school are working on together.",
        "And whatever that might be, we as adults, have to be putting the time and energy to help that child be successful.",
        "I think technology can be very, very helpful in helping students learn and engaging students in very, very different ways.",
        "And I think, working with the broader community as well after school programs, after school supports; drama, arts, sports, music.",
        "Some students who struggled during the regular school day, absolutely find their passion in robotics, in debate, in theater; in making sure the students have those kinds of opportunities, as well.",
        "So not one simple answer, Neal, but unfortunately, there are too many students like Mike who are frustrated, who don't feel they're being challenged, where expectations are too low, frankly.",
        "And that's simply not good enough.",
        "Mike, thank you.",
        "That was a great call.",
