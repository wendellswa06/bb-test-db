        "States have complained, of course, that the law is too rigid, that it does not take into account the progress that kids make over time, not just year to year.",
        "So last Friday, US Education Secretary Margaret Spellings said she agreed.",
        "She now supports something called a growth model, and that will help gauge students' progress over the long term.",
        "The change is to be piloted in 10 states and is designed to appease a political firestorm after it became very clear that under No Child Left Behind, the vast majority of schools, even those considered to be good schools, were just not making enough progress.",
        "So changes in 10 states.",
        "What other changes are there, and why did the department give in at this moment?",
        "Well, the political timing, of course, is always suspect.",
        "One reason that this may have happened, of course, is because the last thing the administration needs at this time is the grief that it's been getting from governors, increasingly Republicans and Democrats, who say this law is unworkable, it's unfunded and it's intrusive.",
        "Any other changes?",
        "Well, the other changes involve teacher training, they involve who provides supplemental services for remediation or kids who need a lot of help.",
        "Keep in mind that since her appointment a year ago this month, Margaret Spellings has been fielding so many complaints that, really, she's had no choice.",
        "She has had to tinker over and over again, and we've seen the results.",
        "I mean, we are seeing now less criticism.",
        "On the other hand, there are serious questions as to whether this law is being watered down or not.",
        "Well, you know, the character of Nor(ph), you know, she is actually a Caucasian American born and raised in the United States, married to an Egyptian immigrant.",
        "You know, we want to keep saying that all these problems of women being battered just happen to be on the shores of people that happen to be quote-unquote \"\"tribal\"\".",
        "But again, the battered woman syndrome is all around us.",
        "The character that Laura Melagrano plays so bravely is one of an American woman, and she again epitomizes, again, the element of beyond is there, over there, too.",
        "She epitomizes a woman that obviously her background is such where she comes from a battered family.",
        "Again, violence begets violence.",
        "I want to ask you about the brother.",
        "He is someone who -- if you talk about beyond, he is very beyond, very strange.",
        "Tell us about him and why you felt it was important to have this character in the film?",
        "Well, for one, you know, there are societies where the man's son is everything.",
        "The female is nothing.",
        "I mean, beyond a second class citizen, she is nothing.",
        "And clearly the father is fully invested in the son.",
        "And of course, you know, the repression has affected not just Sahira but also the brother.",
        "He is at an age where the repression manifests itself in ways that are quite unhealthy really.",
        "Let's talk a little bit about your background.",
        "How has your own personal journey affected the journey that you took to make this film?"

        "All the stuff because...",
        "Quickly, Ryan, what's being discussed here?",
        "Well, this is a recording secretly made by Cohen in September of 2016.",
        "It's a conversation with Trump at Trump Tower.",
        "They discuss a number of things, some related to the campaign.",
        "Parts of the tape, as we heard, are kind of muddled and unintelligible.",

        "We first learned of this recording actually late last week, right?",
        "And now we're just actually hearing it.",
        "What's the significance of it?",
        "Well, there are a couple things.",
        "First off, the president appears familiar with the financial agreement that AMI had with McDougal.",
        "That's of note because Trump's camp has initially denied - or rather initially denied any knowledge of the deal whatsoever.",
        "This also raises questions about possible campaign finance violations.",
        "The president's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has told me that the president did not ultimately pay AMI for McDougal's story.",
        "He says that AMI held on to it for its own reasons.",
        "But the specifics of any payment matter.",
        "The problem here is that the tape does not answer any of the questions that it raises about possible campaign finance violations.",
        "Another significant point is that it's coming from Michael Cohen's legal team.",
        "Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, provided CNN with the tape.",
        "CNN aired it late last night.",
        "So this marks a significant escalation in the conflict that we've seen between Cohen and Trump, and that really raises a lot of possible risks for the president.",
        "What do you mean by risks?",
        "I mean, in what way could this be a problem for the White House?",
        "Because of who Cohen is and what he may know.",
        "So Cohen worked for years as the president's personal lawyer.",
        "He worked for years as his fixer.",
        "So he has a deep reservoir of knowledge about the president's personal matters, as well as his business dealings.",
        "Remember that it was Cohen who arranged the payment to the porn actor Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign.",
        "She's another woman who alleges having an affair with Trump.",
        "And Cohen is now under federal investigation in New York.",
        "That has put him under a lot of legal and financial pressure.",
        "He hasn't been charged yet, but the FBI is looking into Cohen's business dealings, including these payments.",
        "Federal agents, you may recall, raided Cohen's residences and office back in April as part of their investigation.",
        "Trump was furious at the time.",
        "He called the raids an attack on the country.",
        "Now, Trump is lambasting Cohen on Twitter, calling the recordings inconceivable and sad.",
        "And Cohen, I'm told, feels that Trump has abandoned him and this relationship, which we've understood to always be kind of, well, one-sided, appears to be unraveling even more.",
        "In the meantime, we know that the FBI may have many more materials, right?",
        "I mean, when they raided Cohen's office, they carted away a lot."

        "That deadline is fast approaching, and there's little or no evidence that we're going to be remotely close.",
