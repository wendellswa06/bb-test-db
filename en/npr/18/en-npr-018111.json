        "He said the essence of copyright law is for content makers to have control over their works.",
        "He ordered the rental companies to turn over their edited inventory to film studios within days.",
        "Ken Roberts, of CleanFilms, says while he's not sure how his company will respond to the ruling, one thing is clear.",
        "We don't believe that we had a true, fair hearing, and so we will be fighting it.",
        "The ruling does not effect other companies which sidestepped the editing issue by providing software or hardware which automatically edits scenes in unaltered DVDs.",
        "The Directors Guild of America says it's concerned about those businesses as well."
