        "Well, my member of Congress is an idiot, so I don't know if it would do any good.",
        "He's been pretty much a lifelong member of Congress and he's lied to his constituency before, so I don't really--he--for example, he said he wasn't going to vote for the recent--Boehlert said he wasn't going to vote for the recent budget, but at the last minute he did support the administration's position on that.",
        "Thanks for your call, Patrick.",
        "Peter Overby, do you think that this idea of a public financing system is a viable one?",
        "I don't know.",
        "I can pretty easily see where the problem would be with it, which is the problem with any campaign finance regulatory system.",
        "The Supreme Court says you can regulate some political money, the money that goes directly to candidates, directly to parties.",
        "And so there's a line drawn between money that can be regulated and money that cannot be regulated.",
        "Wherever you draw that line, there's going to be a lot of money right outside that line pushing right up against it.",
        "So if you have public financing, you'll have, say, the candidates qualifying to get public financing and not taking any outside contributions.",
        "There are going to be people with outside money trying to figure out how they can spend money in support of their candidate, maybe not necessarily saying, you know, `Go out and vote for Joe Doakes,' but doing some sorts of things to help Joe Doaks get elected.",
        "And, of course, the Supreme Court, when looking at the campaign finance laws, said money and politics is like water.",
        "It just finds any crack and flows into it.",

        "I'm wondering about the K Street Project.",
        "In '94, when the Republicans came into power, my understanding is is that they basically--at least in one particular case, and there was a kind of broader attitude of, `If you've done any business with the Democrats, we don't want you.",
        "You're not going to be involved anymore.",
        "You're just done.",
        "I mean, there was one particular case where they got a lobbyist fired or removed from the floor permanently.",
        "And I'm wondering about that impact and--in terms of the ethics investigation.",
        "Julian Zelizer, do you know about the K Street Project?",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "The K Street Project was a key accomplishment or failure of the Republican revolution.",
        "And it was an attempt not only for Republicans after they gained control of the House and Senate in 1994 to say they would only do business with Republican-leaning interest groups, but also to kind of get former staffers on the Hill into jobs in the interest groups that they dealt with.",
        "And that's part of what the Abramoff and Scanlon scandal is about.",
        "It's the K Street Project coming to life.",
        "So it was a very aggressive push between 1994 and 2004 to solidify the ties between money and politics.",
        "And I think that is actually a big--it's in many ways what we're talking about right now.",
        "Peter Overby, what kind of impact did it have?"

        "It had a significant impact.",
        "The--what was going on was the Republicans looked at K Street and said, you know, `Why are all these corporations represented by former Democratic Hill staffers?",
        "So the K Street Project was an effort to reverse, in a couple of years, a trend that had been going on for 40 years that the Democrats controlled Congress.",
        "And they had a fair amount of success with it and it also opens up questions about where the loyalties of these folks lie.",
        "You know, do you--if you're one of these lobbyists, are you more loyal to the trade association you represent or to your old patron back on Capitol Hill?",

        "Good.",
        "Great.",
        "Can we apply the same ethics standards to politicians as we do to doctors or teachers or other public officials?",
        "Well, no. I mean, I don't think that you can apply identical ethics because the quandaries, the ethical quandaries, that come up are going to differ from profession to profession, if you will.",
        "If a surgeon makes an error because he is under the influence of something at any given moment, that can lead to the death of a patient.",
        "So one wants rather strict scrutiny of the condition of medical personnel.",
        "It's rather different when you're dealing with people in Congress who could very well get happy, shall we say, on an occasion or two and not do terrible damage to the commonweal.",
        "So I think that we, appropriately, of course, expect no egregious criminal behavior from anyone who is engaged in any kind of activity that involves the public in one way or the other.",
        "But when you're dealing with Congress, when you're dealing with any political body, it's very difficult, I think, to draw a bright line separating those activities that are part of hardball politics--and politics is a contact sport, as we all know--and those activities that cross some line into unethical or illegal behavior.",
        "And I also think that we shouldn't assume that the ethical and the legal are identical--not necessarily so.",
        "I think that as Americans we have a great enthusiasm for proliferating laws and codes and multiplying these many times over so that people can be in compliance with one and in violation of another and so on and so forth.",
        "And we tend to lurch, I think often--and if you look at the history of concerns with ethics in political life, you can see this--from perhaps a lack of sufficient scrutiny and oversight to kind of wildly overdoing it and running up against a possible criminal evasion of just ordinary political activity."

        "That's a complicated case and so on, but clearly you got--a whole lot turns on the fact that you got an aggressive Democratic prosecutor who obviously has no love loss for Mr. DeLay, and it's also clear that whatever Mr. DeLay's alleged violations and the money front are concerned, that he has earned the ire of all sorts of people because of the redistricting that went on in Texas that favored the Republicans after having for so many years favored the Democrats.",

        "I think that there are certain temptations associated with it that have to do with money, obviously, that need to be scrutinized.",
        "But I think so much of the way we evaluate these things now just suggest that all of this is some deeply ingrained, entangled web of corruption, and I think that's far too--that's melodrama, that's not really factual.",

        "And I think some evidence has emerged that the boundaries might have been pushed by the Republican leadership, just as Democratic leaders had pushed it in the 1970s and '80s.",
        "And in those moments we need to scrutinize the system.",
        "And we shouldn't demonize Congress as an institution, but we certainly need to investigate whether these kind of boundaries have been crossed because, ultimately, the cost is to undermine the confidence of the public in the political system."
