        "Ooh.",
        "Well, there are, of course, plans being cooked up by various members of Congress to enact one reform or another, and, you know, the--it's a cyclical thing.",
        "There was a lobbying reform in the mid-'90s.",
        "There was campaign finance reform in 2001 and 2002.",
        "So the business of lobbying is coming more in to the daylight.",
        "That's one of the long-term trends here.",
        "And I think it's quite possible as a result of the Abramoff case, in particular, that there's going to be more disclosure of lobbying activities.",
        "And that goes back to kind of the broad historical view.",
        "There used to be no disclosure at all.",
        "So one of the reasons that we are alarmed by what we see now is that we can see it.",
        "These things did not used to be disclosed at all.",
        "You know, 50 years ago, we wouldn't have known that Jack Abramoff was lobbying for the Indian tribes, let alone, you know, what he was charging them.",
        "And another technological kicker here, the investigators wouldn't have gotten his e-mails to see what he was telling his partner about their lobbying strategies.",
        "So we know a lot more in this age of information than we used to about how Washington works.",
        "OK.",
        "Thank you so much for joining us, Peter Overby, NPR's correspondent, covering power, money and influence.",
        "He joined us in Studio 3A.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "And we'll talk more about the elections later this week.",
        "Stay tuned to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "This is Day to Day, I'm Madeleine Brand.",
        "And I'm Alex Cohen.",
        "During the stretch of nearly constant awful economic news, no surprise that people are looking for an escape.",
        "For many, one of the cheapest ways to get away from it all is at the movies.",
        "Ticket sales have been up over the past few months.",
        "To talk more about that, we're joined now by Pamela McClintock of Variety.",
        "And Pamela, compared to past years, just how much have ticket sales increased?",
        "Well, so far this year revenues are up more than 10 percent.",
        "And the more startling gain is in admissions, the actual number of people going to the movies.",
        "And that's up over 10 percent here today, which is very unheard of in this day and age.",
        "Why is it unheard of?",
        "Well, I think since the birth of DVDs the actual number of people going to the movies has sort of been on the decline.",
        "Some years, you'll see a slight uptick but never to this degree.",
        "So I think it is proof that, you know, as people give up, maybe dining out and more expensive forms of entertainment, they're opting to go to the movies more."

        "So how is the movie industry doing overall?",
        "And, of course, you also have in recent weeks this never-ending stalemate with the contract negotiations with the Screen Actors Guild.",

        "The elderly are said to be in the winter of their lives.",
        "And winter is synonymous with the end of life.",
        "That does not make winter the grim reaper.",
        "Rather, it is a time of reflection in those for whom childhood is long gone.",
        "My father died in the summer of 1997.",
        "For me, his final months resemble the patterns of settling in for winter.",
        "A turning inward and slowing down.",
        "In the end, his breath grew more and more shallow until there was just the quiet.",

        "I'm visiting Southern California as I write this, a place where winter expresses itself as rain.",
        "It would be easy to live in a climate where there are no freezing temperatures and snow, but I would still define the shape of the year by winter, as I knew it from my childhood.",
        "David Greenberger lived in Greenwich, New York.",
        "And it's time to play The Puzzle."
