        "That's when it happens in real time.",

        "He's been doing this work a while.",
        "He says he's interpreted every president since Ronald Reagan.",
        "Telemundo hired him to find some of the interpreters.",
        "He says there are few things to look for in a good interpreter for a live event, like a presidential debate.",
        "This is an art.",
        "You want voices that sound pleasant, that sound accurate.",
        "And you try sort of to match those voices with the person that is going to be interpreted.",
        "Telemundo is used to producing real-time interpretations.",
        "In early 2016, the network had to deal with fewer candidates, and they were all male.",
        "This week's debates pose some different challenges, says Leticia Herrera.",
        "She's the producer behind the debates.",
        "What caught us by surprise - the amount of female in this election.",
        "So when we have so many females, we really have to identify with different voices."
