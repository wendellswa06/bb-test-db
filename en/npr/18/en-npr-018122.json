        "The number of U.S.-flagged vessels is very small.",
        "This vessel, the Alabama Maersk, was carrying food to Mombasa on U.N.",
        "program, but -food aid.",
        "But relatively speaking, most of these are third nation vessels that are involved here.",
        "You're quite right.",
        "And as President Obama said, we have to work together with other nations, and we have to encourage the European nations and - India and others who go through that territory to have some of their crews armed, the captain and maybe two policemen that they can trust.",
        "Two policemen onboard…",
        "Onboard of the ship.",
        "Yes.",
        "So that would mean hiring, effectively mercenaries to ride as (unintelligible).",
        "Well, normal policemen like - or guards, guards before buildings.",
        "They're not mercenaries.",
        "They are hired as guards for the ships.",
        "And the critical point is when pirates climb onboard of the ship.",
        "That's when they can seize hostages, and that's how they can then want -press us for ransom.",
        "Some people are advocating less aggressive methods.",
        "They point out people can be hosed off the side of the ship with a water canon or that devices can be trailed behind the ship that emit very loud noises that make it very uncomfortable for the pirates.",
        "That's been used successfully to deter at least one attack.",
        "That can be used, indeed.",
        "And if that's sufficient and they don't climb onboard, that's good enough.",
        "It could start with that.",
        "Also, it has been suggested of barbed wire.",
        "That is are quite effective until the pirates figure out to get some ways of cutting the barbed wire.",
        "Another point that people make is that up until, well, a couple of recent incidents, not just this one that ended yesterday, but there was an incident involving a hijack of a French ship just a few days ago that ended with one man - a couple of pirates being killed, but also one of the hostages being killed as well.",
        "But until that incident - and I think there was an incident where the Indian navy opened fire on a vessel, too, but very few casualties and none, thus far, caused by pirates.",
        "That's correct, because the pirates want money.",
        "They don't want to kill people.",
        "They're - it's a business.",
        "And they have been now threatening, since Captain Phillips was freed yesterday, that they would take revenge.",
        "It's not clear what they are threatening there with, and we shouldn't be intimidated by that, because we have killed al-Qaida terrorists in other countries, in Afghanistan and so on.",
        "And they have threatened to take revenge.",
        "But just because of that, we didn't walk out and retreat."

        "During the Second World War, merchant ships crossing the Atlantic were formed into convoys that could be more easily protected from attack by German U-boats.",
        "Why would not convoys be at least a partial solution to protect the sea lanes off Somalia?",
        "That's a very different threat.",

        "The pirates don't have submarines.",
        "And the ships, the convoys wouldn't protect us from pirates climbing up on a ship.",
        "That is the critical point.",

        "So, yes, I'm in favor of firing if they have to, because this country, or any other country, should not allow themselves to be taken hostage.",
        "And, again, the payments were made.",
        "I think that's why those people, previous people weren't harmed.",
        "You meant the one man captured in this incident, one of the pirates was aboard the USS Bainbridge, I think, when the incident happened and…",
        "That's correct.",
        "…could face charges, but if he's a teenager, you're right, maybe not.",
        "Yes.",
        "And so it's become a culture.",
        "And I think we made a huge mistake by bugging out of there in '91 after the Black Hawk Down incident because they've had another almost 20 years to foment these problems.",
        "And if we'd stayed in there, as we should've stayed in Lebanon, the terrorists like bin Laden won't see us as a paper tiger that walks away.",
