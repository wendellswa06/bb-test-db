        "So, Dr. Shaw, it is a fact that white rural communities have been hit especially hard by this opioid crisis.",
        "But we were looking at a report from the Centers for Disease Control that said that, actually, the death rate of Native Americans from opioid overdoses was the highest of any racial demographic.",
        "Some 8.4 per 100,000 Native Americans died of opioid overdoses in 2014.",
        "Can you tell me more about that?",
        "Well, I believe that in any population where there are a depressed or a low socioeconomic status, any time you have those issues, people are more vulnerable to opiate overdose.",
        "Now for Native Americans, many Native American populations suffer from what is known as historical and intergenerational trauma, which has to do with historical events that have afflicted Native American tribes, everything from Wounded Knee to other issues that have affected us culturally that have caused kind of a historical shame that has transmitted across generations, even to succeeding generations, that it has been shown to be associated with increased rates of depression, drug use and drug addiction.",
        "So that's the additional issue faced by Native Americans and perhaps more sensitive in those populations that live in reservation areas.",
        "From the work that you've seen and the work that you've done yourself, what do you think are the best ways to treat this problem with a particular focus on Indian country and Native American communities?",
        "I think the two most important pieces are, first of all, this is a biological disease at its core, whatever the reason is.",
        "And we're still finding out why experimental and recreational use in youth progresses more rapidly to opiate addiction in native populations.",
        "We're still trying to find out the best practices for preventing or slowing that down.",
        "But the biological basis is a disorder in the reward pathway in the brain known as the mezal limbic system.",
        "An important part of that therapy has to be medication-assisted treatment."
