        "That doesn't mean that the treatment was futile.",
        "But I think trying to use influence and education, both for native leaders so they can get a better perspective of this illness - in particular, the biological nature of it - to be able to testify before Congress, including the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, and try to put the native-specific issues before our legislators, that's my been role and my target.",

        "She was it, Jack.",
        "I mean, in the late '50s and early '60s, she was number one for a very long time.",
