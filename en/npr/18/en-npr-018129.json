        "I think your phrase, which I much admired, was something like that the pain he caused you could never keep pace with the pain that he felt.",
        "That's definitely true.",
        "You know, one of the reasons that I began writing on this subject is because when I was a kid, I really had no clear idea what was going on with my dad.",
        "I knew that something was very, very wrong, and I was frightened, but I was also unsure of what it was, and that was a time in America where people didn't much talk about mental illness.",
        "Certainly, that was true in our family, too.",
        "There was a conspicuous effort in our family to sort of take care of him as much as possible because he was a man who couldn't take care of himself.",
        "Your father died when he was 65.",
        "You say here that you - now that you're grown, you have an appreciation of the courage it took for him to get there that maybe you lacked when you were a youngster.",
        "That's definitely true.",

        "Anybody who struggles with a terrible disease and keeps on is someone whose determination and whose diligence we can admire.",

        "Is there any chance of Jerome Powell getting fired by President Trump?",
        "But when it's a terrible disease that nobody can see, that really isn't talked about much in his time and is something that creates a great fear and a great horror in most of the people who you're close to and who ultimately makes you unable, really, to be close to anybody, that you keep a sense of optimism, as my father did, I find both heartbreaking and truly admirable.",
        "It's - you know, when my father was - my father was the first son in his family, the first child and the first son, and he was first-generation American on one side of his family, and he went to Harvard, where he became one of the stars of the Harvard lacrosse team, and it wasn't that he was a great athlete, it was that he tried harder than everybody else.",
        "At the end of the day, everybody else would be taking a shower.",
        "My father would be out on the field running extra laps until, you know, until nightfall, and I think of that in a sort of metaphorical way, too, for how he spent his life.",
        "As his life darkened and darkened, he was still out there, trying and trying to make something more of himself, and while he was, really because of his disease, an impossible person to be around, as I look back on him and whatever distance there was created the opportunity to really have a great admiration for his lifelong determination against something that was a truly, truly horrible plague."

        "They fabricated the evidence against her weeks before the trial just to get a conviction so that it would put pressure on my - our father.",

        "That was a way to put pressure on both of them.",
        "And then, when neither of them would come across, the government killed the hostage.",
        "That's what happened.",
        "The government took her as a hostage and killed her.",
        "And we would like the government to acknowledge that.",
        "To follow up on that, the Seton Hall Law School center for research and public policy just released an analysis last week of the prosecution of Ethel Rosenberg.",
        "And this was an independent analysis.",
        "And their analysis was essentially what my brother just said - that she was collateral damage and that she not only should never have been convicted, she never should have been arrested in the first place."
