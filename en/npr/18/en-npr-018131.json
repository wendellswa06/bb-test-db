        "He's 45, which is not young in, say, hip-hop terms or MTV terms, but it's young for someone running for president.",

        "What is he going to do to really distinguish his policy so that he could win?",
        "Well, first of all, let me suggest a couple of things.",
        "First of all, he's 45 years old.",
        "If he were to become president, he'd be 47, which would be older than Bill Clinton, older than President Kennedy and several other presidents, so I don't think that's really an issue.",
        "And, you know, I think when he stood up in 2002 and gave a very piercing critique of the pending war at Iraq, and urged the Congress not to authorize the war, that was at the time a controversial position to take.",
        "When he came to Washington and pushed ethics reforms, including disclosure of a lobbyist fundraising, that was not welcomed by either party particularly.",
        "I don't think he's afraid to take difficult stands.",
        "I think he's proven that.",
        "But in terms of the overall - the question is if longevity in Washington is the test, then obviously he would not be the answer.",
        "And Senator Biden, for example, he's been there for 34 years, Senator Dodd's been there for more than 30 years.",
        "If we were awarding the presidency on that basis, they would be elected.",

        "We've been discussing healthcare for a very long time.",
        "We've been discussing energy for a long time.",
        "We can't get things done on those issues because our politics get in the way, the lobbyist culture of Washington gets in the way, and our inability to come together as a country around these solutions because of our politics gets in the way.",

        "What do you think about the race question?",
        "There has been obviously a lot of debate about whether or not an African-American can win the presidency, period.",

        "And hopefully, people will not vote against him on that basis either.",
        "He's going to ask on the basis of his record, his commitments and his vision for this country.",
        "Now I tell you that when he started his race for the Senate here in Illinois, he was polling at about 31 percent of the African-American vote and he ended up with 95 percent at the end of the race.",
        "He earned those votes as he earned the other votes that he got, and he'll do that here.",
        "I think it's not surprising that at this point in the race he's new to the scene for a lot of people, and they're unwilling to make a commitment, as they should be.",
        "He has to go out and earn those votes, and that's what he's going to do.",
        "Final question: Is Senator Obama going to have to run far to the left in order to win the primary and then re-center himself, as so many candidates from the Democratic Party have had to do?",
        "I think he's going to be the same candidate from start to finish.",
        "You know, one of those - that's one of the kind of unfortunate qualities of our politics is that people seem to shift and turn and move according to the political season.",
        "It's one of the things that I think contributes to a great deal of cynicism.",
        "And so, you know, he I think will be a consistent voice throughout this election.",
