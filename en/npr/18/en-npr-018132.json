        "The president's been I think pretty strong since day one in his language towards Iran.",
        "He was responding to comments made from them, and he's going to continue to focus on the safety and security of American people.",
        "Trump had already pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, and the U.S.",
        "is preparing to reimpose sanctions that were lifted under that deal soon.",
        "That was press secretary Sarah Sanders there.",
        "The language that Trump used in his tweet sounded a lot like the kind of language he was using against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un before those two leaders ultimately sat down for talks.",
        "Is the White House trying to do the same sort of thing here and get Iran to the negotiating table?",
        "It seems that that could be the case, but Sanders was asked this multiple times during the White House briefing, and she said she wouldn't talk about White House strategy.",
        "But you're right.",
        "The language is very similar to that fire and fury rhetoric that Trump used on North Korea.",
        "Of course there are differences in this situation.",
        "Iran has a much more complex political system.",
        "You're not just appealing to a dictator like Kim.",
        "And also with North Korea, there was a more united front among our international allies in holding these sanctions and holding North Korea kind of to the fire.",
        "But with Iran, you have the U.S.",
        "kind of split from European allies who wanted the U.S.",
        "to stay in the Iran nuclear deal.",
        "How does President Trump's tough approach to Iran fit with this broader idea of America first?",
        "Well, the White House argues that this is all about keeping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.",
        "The move to support Iranian protesters is something that kind of traditional conservatives have supported in the past.",
        "The risk with all of this, though, is that you draw the U.S.",
        "into a military conflict in the Middle East.",
        "And that is something that Trump has in the past seemed that he wants to withdraw from overseas and kind of save that money and not get involved.",
        "On the campaign trail, Trump constantly talked about the Iraq war and what a mistake that was.",
        "So it would seem on that basis that you wouldn't want to get involved in another long-term conflict in the Middle East.",
        "NPR's Ayesha Rascoe, thanks a lot.",
        "Thank you.",
        "The Republican Party is dealing with a scramble for leadership at a very critical time.",
        "That's right.",
        "So House Speaker Paul Ryan announced yesterday that he is not going to seek re-election, and this will end his three-year run as the Republican leader."

        "I will be retiring in January, leaving this majority in good hands with what I believe is a very bright future.",
        "All right, so last night, Ryan and fellow Republican leaders were meeting with President Trump at the White House, and the president tweeted out this photo of the group.",
        "They were giving thumbs-up.",
        "They had these big smiles on their faces.",
        "And the president's message - lots to discuss as we continue making America great again.",
        "All right, for more on all of this, we're joined now by NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson.",
        "Good morning, Mara.",
        "Good morning, Noel, for the very first time.",
        "I'm happy to talk to you.",
        "(Laughter) So Mara, this all comes as we head into what was already shaping up to be a very difficult midterm election season for the Republican Party.",
        "Will Ryan's impending departure make it even more difficult?",
        "All right, as David mentioned, President Trump has been active on Twitter, communicating messages to Russia.",
        "He's taunted Russia, we should say, on Twitter.",
        "Yesterday, the president wrote, quote, \"\"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.",
        "Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming, nice, and new and smart.\"\" Trump also said the relationship between the United States and Russia is at its worst point that it's ever been.",
        "Thanks, Farai.",
        "Welcome to Political Corner.",
        "We're joined now by Ron Walters, a professor of political science at the University of Maryland.",

        "Let me start with the campaign being led by Representative William Jefferson, Democrat of Louisiana, to gain reelection.",
        "It appears that he is the leading candidate in that district, despite the ongoing investigation by the FBI that found $90,000 in his freezer, infamously, and a call from Nancy Pelosi - the House Minority Leader - for him to resign.",
        "Joe Watkins, when you hear this, do you think Nancy Pelosi's overstepping her bounds by asking him to resign, given that he has not been indicted?",
        "On the one hand, Nancy Pelosi came to his aid when his office was raided by federal officials.",
        "And now she's asking him to resign before he's even been indicted.",
        "Obviously, she's doing that because she realizes that as long as this cloud hangs over him, it taints him and it taints the Democratic Party and they stand a chance to lose in November.",
        "But clearly, she has angered a lot of Democrats by making this move so quickly.",
        "Well, what's interesting and what's pointed out as possibly a double standard by Jefferson is that she has not asked for the resignation or even a committee assignment change for Representative Allen Mollohan, a Democrat of West Virginia, who's also being investigated for possible misuse of funds.",
        "So is there a double standard here?",
        "Is Jefferson, as an African-American, being subjected to a different level of treatment?",
        "Well, that's the way it looks right now, obviously.",
        "But clearly, a lot of members, a number of members, and even the Congressional Black Caucus are saying that if Nancy Pelosi wants to stand by this kind of a decision, she's going to have to answer for that later on.",
        "And this, again, smacks to some, I think, of the fact that Pelosi and some others may suppose that blacks are always going to vote with Democrats, that blacks are always going to be in the camp of Democrats, so they can do whatever they want with African-American elected officials.",
        "And that, I don't think, is the case anymore.",
        "You know what interesting about this case is that the Republicans have been very supportive of Jefferson.",
        "Going back to when the FBI went into his office, remember Denny Hastert, the speaker of the House, went out of his way."

        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, so it's one of these things where it kind of crosses political lines because you have Nancy Pelosi taking on Jefferson, Hastert supporting Jefferson.",
        "And now you have members of the Democratic Party, especially in the Caucus - Mel Watt, Jim Clyburn, kind of leadership - taking on Pelosi, their fellow Democrat and potentially, if the Democrats were to win in November, the speaker of the House.",
        "The interesting thing to me is that Nancy Pelosi has done this a second time.",
        "Because when Cynthia McKinney came back, her seniority was not restored.",
        "And a lot of people were angry about that.",
        "It looked as though it was the double standard - here again, the only black person to suffer from that.",
        "You see, it's different from the Jefferson case.",
        "But I'm just pointing to the fact that in the past you've had this situation where people left the House or the Senate for whatever reason, came back and had their seniority restored.",
        "Cynthia McKinney's asked for it, and Nancy Pelosi said no.",
        "Got it.",
        "And do you think that was about race?",
        "I think - you know, here's one of these things.",

        "Well, we're not the only one that are saying it.",

        "Now if something happens that you don't get the requisite number of chairs lining up with seniority, all hell could break loose within the Democratic Party.",
