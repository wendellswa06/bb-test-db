        "He fired 16 shots at 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, killing him.",

        "And I don't want to say muted, but it wasn't overwhelming.",
        "And that all changed when there was video of the shooting that was released.",
        "What happened then?",
        "What was the fallout and why?",
        "When the shooting originally occurred, the story that was told and recorded by officers in their reports was that Laquan McDonald lunged at officers, that he battered three officers and that Jason Van Dyke shot in self-defense.",
        "And that story pretty much stood until the dashcam video was released over a year later.",
        "People saw that those reports didn't actually line up with what the video said.",
        "In the video, you see Laquan McDonald, it seems, moving away from officers.",
        "And there's several other discrepancies in that video.",
        "So initially, media - and this is something that we've talked about in our own newsroom - basically took the police version of this story, and that was what we reported.",
        "But, later on, the autopsy was released after some investigation by a journalist who wrote an article for Slate - his name is Jamie Kalven - and talked about what the autopsy showed, which was that some of the shots actually entered through Laquan McDonald's back.",
        "So that was sort of the first indication that maybe that initial story didn't actually line up with what happened.",
        "We learned that there were witnesses - civilian witnesses on the scene - who were directed away from this shooting, whose testimonies were not recorded, and others who later said that they were pressured to change their statements in interviews with the police.",
        "One of the things that's powerful about the podcast to me is that you talk to people who were connected to these events, and you get to hear their feelings about it and how they're living with it as individuals.",
        "And I just want to play some tape of a conversation between WBEZ reporters Patrick Smith and Shannon Heffernan and two friends of Laquan McDonald's, Christian Poole (ph) and Aaron Wilson (ph).",

        "What you hear in that tape is not just their reaction to Laquan's death, but they talk about actually having other friends, other people they cared about, also being the victims of police shootings.",
        "These young men talk about the trauma.",
        "They talk about how they do take drugs to deal with the stress and the trauma.",

        "And I just want to play a little bit of the tape.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "What is one of your darkest moments?",
        "So you're hearing at the end there one of Mr. Van Dyke's lawyers jumping in.",
        "And you disclose that this interview, this whole scene, was fairly tightly controlled - that questions were demanded in advance, which is highly unusual.",
        "I mean, generally, I just have to say most reporters would not agree to that in the current environment.",
        "That just isn't something that most reporters would agree to do.",
        "And that - they crossed certain ones out.",
        "They jumped in quite a bit, as I understand it from the way this was recounted.",
        "But tell me about that.",
        "So we really wrestled with whether and how to use this audio for exactly the reasons you described.",
        "And we came down to a few key issues.",
        "One was that the interview was going to be out there.",
        "Regardless of whether or not we used it, it was going to be in the public eye.",
        "And so we wanted to know, first of all, if it gave us insight into the defense strategy that his attorneys were likely to use.",
        "But we also thought it was important to give some context around some of the statements that he made in that interview.",
        "So, for instance, he says, you know, I'm a good cop.",
        "I always deescalated situations when he was policing.",
        "When you look at his personnel records, however, it shows about 20 citizen complaints against him, at least one with racial overtones.",
        "It also shows that there were lawsuits against him.",
        "One citizen was awarded $350,000 for an injury he sustained when he was cuffed very roughly by Officer Van Dyke.",
        "So we thought, is there a way for us to basically interrogate the interview itself, if that makes sense, and to provide people context that if - especially if you're outside of Chicago, and you're coming into this story, and you're going to be following the trial - because stories like this so often get told in a binary, how do we provide context around Jason Van Dyke in the same way we're able to build context around Laquan McDonald?"

        "Well, as this trial is about to begin, can you just give us a sense of what the mood is?",

        "As a result of the Laquan McDonald shooting, the Justice Department actually conducted a very intense and in-depth investigation into CPD.",
        "It was released in 2017, and it showed a pattern and practice of abusive policing in black neighborhoods.",
        "This didn't come to any surprise to people who have complained about this issue for decades, but it was official record.",

        "It will indicate certain things to police officers.",
        "It will indicate something else to community members depending upon what that verdict is.",
        "So - and I think, as we get deeper into the testimony, and we start to see the case that the defense is making, whether as the victim - his character is put on trial, I think that is going to feed into a great deal of tension in the city and build that tension.",
        "It's already here.",

        "This was put in place, critics suggest, because the partners of both heterosexual and homosexual employees are eligible for his coverage, and what they're suggesting is, beyond declaring joint financial obligations, George Curry, you have to show that you are in a true union with a person in order to get these benefits.",
        "I guess the thought is that they want to stave off those who would just join together, say we were partners, in order to get the coverage.",
        "I think the language they use is non-platonic, and of course, I think I'm all, I'm for more sex, certainly, but you don't hold this requirement for married couples, so I don't think you should have this same requirement for partners here that you don't have in a married couple.",
        "Now of course the goal here is to try to make sure they're a committed relationship, and not just roommates, and of course that's hard to do.",

        "The irony of this situation is, I mean, obviously as a conservative I don't like this idea of the government being intrusive; the irony, however, is that many social conservatives have raised concerns about the idea of domestic partnerships as they do also with civil unions as opposed to gay marriage because of this exact thing.",
        "They say, well, why can't two sisters declare that they are domestic partners and get these same kinds of benefits?",
