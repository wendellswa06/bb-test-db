        "Well, I think we should be keeping an eye on Syria, first and foremost, paying attention to whether the administration has a strategy for Syria.",
        "The president has been previewing missile attacks in his tweets, and the question is, will this be another one-off, minimal strike like the one he conducted last year after a Syrian chemical weapons attack when he hit a single Syrian airfield?",
        "That didn't deter Syria from using chemical weapons again.",
        "So the question is, will this upcoming strike be more expansive?",
        "And if so, does it draw the U.S.",
        "to greater involvement in Syria, possibly a conflict with Russia, just after President Trump announced that he wants to get out of Syria completely and very soon?",
        "And let me ask you briefly about Mike Pompeo.",
        "Do you think he faces a tough confirmation process in the hearing in the Senate?",
        "Excuse me.",
        "I don't - I think that he'll face a lot of pointed questions.",
        "But I think in the end, he will be confirmed.",

        "OK, let's remember, a year ago, just two days after another chemical bombardment in Syria, President Trump ordered a missile strike on that air base in Syria.",
        "But this time, so far, he is holding off on taking action.",
        "For more context on all of this, we have NPR's national security correspondent David Welna."

        "Hi, David.",

        "All right, so a year ago, the U.S.",
        "response was pretty immediate, right?",
        "Why is it being drawn out this time?",
        "Well, you know, I think this is a bit of a political quandary for Trump.",
        "After all, it was only last week, as Mara said, that he was saying the time had come for the U.S.",
        "to pull out of Syria.",
        "And attacking another government in the Middle East is not quite what Trump promised his base when he campaigned on putting America first.",
        "There's also the reality that last year's Tomahawk strike against the Syrian airfield failed to stop that country's regime from using chemical weapons.",
        "So if this isn't to be simply a repeat, whatever's done this time will likely have to be more far-reaching, which takes more planning.",
        "And there's also an effort this time to get some other countries to join the effort, countries such as France, and the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia, which is making things more complicated.",
        "And there are at least some U.S.",
        "officials with misgivings about carrying out reprisals for an attack that has yet to be investigated by outside experts.",
        "And all of this is also giving Syria more time to move some of its assets to safer places, such as with Russian bases and out of harm's - possible harm's way from an American strike.",
        "David, as the president continues a strike, I wonder, there is a big question here.",
        "Is there a legal basis for the U.S.",
        "to attack Syrian military targets?",
        "Well, if you listen to experts in constitutional and international law, it's - there's slim to none legal basis.",
        "They say that this would be a clear violation of international law, which requires that either there be consent from Syria for carrying out an attack, which there clearly isn't, or authorization by the United Nations Security Council, which is also lacking, or that the U.S.",
        "be acting in its own self-defense, which would not seem to be the case.",
        "There's also no clear authorization from Congress for Trump to order military strikes against the government of Syria.",
        "And while that did not stop him from carrying out last year's attack, there are members of Congress this time who are saying that constitutionally, he has to get permission from Congress to act.",
        "All right, so Congress is pushing back.",
        "If the U.S.",
        "were to strike Syria, what do you think would be in store?",
        "How might this be different this time around?",
        "Well, you know, besides being bigger, it's also likely that a strike would put the U.S.",
        "much more in peril of a direct military confrontation with Russia, which has both military equipment and troops bolstering the Syrian regime.",
        "Trump's tweet yesterday seemed to be responding to a warning last month from Russia that any threat to Russian lives in Syria from a U.S.",
        "attack would prompt a Russian military response, not just to any rockets that are fired, but also to the platforms that launch those rockets.",
        "And that raises the possibility of Russia attacking a U.S.",
        "warship in the Mediterranean or trying to shoot down any U.S.",
        "aircraft that might be involved in a punitive strike.",
        "All right, very clearly a lot at stake here.",

        "Do you suspect that the fact that this woman has been ordered to take some of her posting, is this likely to have some kind of chilling effect on reviews?",
