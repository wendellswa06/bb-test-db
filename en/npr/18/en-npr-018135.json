        "So what is your MBTI?",
        "I think you're down a slippery slope when you start this.",
        "And of course when we go to the philosophical thing about whether or not a committed relationship really has to be one that is sexual, so, there you go.",
        "I think, I don't know how they deal with the fact that this is a, I know this is a serious issue and there's millions of dollars at stake here, but to require that somebody declare that they are having a non-platonic relationship just seems to me to be beyond Orwellian.",
        "It seems to be, it's got to be illegal.",
        "This is crazy.",
        "I just don't, I don't see how this can fly.",
        "Of course the other concern is that this information could end up in the wrong hands.",
        "I mean, we've seen all kinds of information out there, and it could be used to, I don't want to say blackmail, I'll say whitemail, of people, or used in some other kind of fashion.",
        "So that's another concern as well.",
        "Well, I mean, but in a sense, though, this often, these kinds of things certainly come up in divorce proceedings.",
        "You know, lack of consortium, withholding marital rights, these kind of things, so I, obviously this, it ends up getting into the public sector one way or the other.",
        "That's a different situation though.",
        "Alright, but Callie there are going to be those who will say that we'll blowing our horn far too much about this, that you check a box, just say yeah, we're having sex, and you move on.",
        "Well, of course that's what people are going to do, but I thought the discussion here was whether or not this was something that ought to have this language included in it as a matter of course.",
        "And I think that's the issue; is it legal?",
        "Is that, I don't know if it's legal, but what are we saying if we're requiring that?",
        "And that is stepping into people's bedrooms.",
        "With regard to what Robert said about the divorce hearings, yes that does come up in divorce hearings but both those parties, they didn't want to be there but they ended up there, and they'll use whatever they need to use for that scenario.",
        "This is a situation where people are just trying to get insurance.",
        "I think this is really way out of bounds.",
        "Alright, talking about checking boxes, we'll move on to another story.",
        "This coming out of a California-based James Irvine Foundation that did a study that looked at the idea of that box that says other or unknown when it comes to race.",
        "It's being checked by more and more people, and they're actually finding out that more white people are checking that other box.",
        "That other has grown from about 3.2 percent to 5.9 percent in terms of the use of that box over the last decade.",
        "There are those who are concerned, Callie, about the idea that this may indeed influence admissions of minorities because some admissions officers have admitted that they assume applicants who checked other were part of a minority group and they count that in their admissions numbers when they are letting students in."

        "I think that's absolutely right.",
        "I have to say this is the first time I've heard of this, maybe you guys had heard of it before, and it's kind of interesting.",
        "It speaks to me about, we talk so little in this country about race, about ethnicity, and there's such a vast misunderstanding about it that I think some of the people checking it really don't have a clue, and so they say, well, okay, other.",
        "The information suggests that there are people who are bi-racial who feel as though they don't really fit in either category so they're going to check other.",
        "Now, some of the universities have suggested that they have put enough boxes to cover everybody's race on either side, whatever bi-race you may, however you may identify yourself.",
        "But still there are folks, and I guess a lot of white people, who feel as though they are, they fit in the other category.",
        "And I think that this does leave universities in a quandary if they are trying to do the right thing and make certain that there is a racial and ethnic balance on campus.",
        "Robert, there are also others who suggest that whites may be calculating enough to understand that if you check other you may have a better chance of getting in the university, if they have to fill a certain number or a quota of minority applicants.",
        "Well, and that's, that's exactly right.",
        "I mean it's the flip side of the affirmative action game, where, I mean, obviously we can say, America being what it is, you can find somebody, some blue-eyed blond kid on the street who may have some Cherokee in him and all this other kind of stuff, but when they see these options and they realize that certain slots may be reserved, or somebody may look on you a little more strongly if you are a minority, it's, you want to get whatever advantage you can get to get into that institution.",
        "I mean, the irony is, it's kind of, it's the new, it can be the new version of passing.",
        "I'm passing now as a member of an undisclosed minority.",
        "Well, Robert, I disagree there with affirmative action and the game.",
        "I'm, I hope you didn't mean it seriously.",
        "But that is a correlation...",
        "Not complete, it's not completely though, some people do game it.",
        "Okay, but most people don't, but, there is a direct correlation between the increase, which is almost doubling of people checking this other box, and the drop, as most universities are reporting, of the number of people of color they're admitting.",
        "And the reason they're doing it is because whites, like other groups, feel like they've been threatened.",
        "And this is their way of really gaming, Robert, this is more of a game than anything else.",
        "And it actually hurts people who need to be there.",
        "Well, it's, you know, I wouldn't, it's calculating, it's calculating.",
        "It's not really a game, that they see, and it's, it's certainly logical for them to say, if they perceive that the institution is going to look at them more favorably by perceiving them as a minority, it just makes sense.",
        "I don't think it is a game, but it is, it's very, very, it's very, very serious.",
        "Oh, I think it's a game and it's a game they're trying to win.",
        "But what's happening, some universities are doing, and I'm glad they're doing this, is contacting their high schools and finding out from their counselor whether this person is in fact white or black.",

        "No, an other, what is, what it means?",
        "I'm sorry Callie, go ahead.",
        "Yeah, but what George said, they would have seen the students and presumably have some information about the students, so that's a way to try and trace back.",
        "I think it's important, that's one of the things that some of the universities are thinking about doing, is to go back and just check with those students and say, Okay, why other?",

        "You know, who then determines what's what?",
        "That's always the problem.",

        "He clearly, in looking at him, is black, but he had been told and believed his entire life, in fact, that he was white and had a skin disease and it wasn't until he reached his 20s that he realized, something ain't right with this picture.",
