        "Yeah.",
        "And, do you think that having a President Obama in the White House makes any difference in this regard?",
        "Oh absolutely, having him, and it's in some respects.",
        "I would be - I was very excited, and I actually worked on his campaign, and race didn't come up that much and that would really impress me.",
        "And, but having such an incredible man who happens to be black in a leadership position when its so needed.",
        "Sure, it's got to make a difference.",
        "But my God, we're talking hundreds of years of culture.",
        "And, you know, to expect that it's going to be over and done with in such a brief period of time is (laughing) mind boggling.",

        "That was on purpose.",
        "And that's right.",
        "I think it's more socio-economic driven.",

        "They made strategic decisions all along to keep race deliberately off the table because the worst thing that felt for their crossover appeal would be for Obama to come off as an angry black man, someone who was resentful about, what black folks have been through in this country.",
        "Well, that's the exact opposite of what they wanted to convey.",
        "Quite the opposite, there was a subtle message delivered that as far as your race goes, it would be redemptive to vote for Barack Obama.",
        "Just to look past his race and look his qualifications.",
        "And that support for him would confirmed that you are looking passed his race.",
        "And it wasn't until the Reverend Wright episode that Barack Obama publicly confronted race and made that eloquent speech, about 40-minutes speech, talking it all out.",
