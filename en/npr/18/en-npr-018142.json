        "And there is a little of it going on, but by and large, the scientists who advised the European Commission have said, yes, this is fine.",
        "There's no problem with it.",
        "You know, billions of people have been eating genetically modified food for years, all over the world, hopefully showing there's no problem with it.",
        "And yet the politicians say, no. We don't like the look of this.",
        "It will be bad in various ways.",
        "So that debate is definitely going on.",
        "I think looking forward, there's a lot of talk about how are we are going to feed nine or 10 billion people later in this century?",
        "And the proponents of genetic modification say well, you know, we could make these crops that are more drought tolerant and, you know, have vitamins in them, and all this sort of stuff.",
        "And maybe they can.",
        "But, I mean, the fact is if you look at the genetically modified crops that exist today, the main thing they have is this herbicide tolerance.",
        "And that's good for the farmers and for the makers of the herbicide, but there's no actual benefit for the consumer at the end of it there.",
        "So I think the jury's still out.",
        "I think it's possible that there might be some benefits, and it may be that this is one of the tools in the toolbox that we're going to need in order to feed everyone in the next century, but it's certainly not a panacea, and we really haven't seen - you know, there have been great claims about crops that can grow in very saline or dry conditions, for example, so far, but they really haven't been backed up with evidence yet.",

        "Standage, given that the current economic theory says that if I eat a steak, the cow had to be fed corn or wheat, and that raises the world price for corn and wheat, does that mean that when I eat a steak I'm helping to starve people in those places in the world where people can't afford grain?",
        "Well, I don't think it's quite as simple as that.",
        "What's certainly the case is that more people in India and China in particular do want to eat steak, and that is one of the reasons that food prices went up quite dramatically at the beginning of last year.",
        "But it's only one of them, and there are several of them.",
        "You can't blame them for wanting to have more middle-class lifestyles and Western-style diets, but there are many other things, too.",
        "Biofuels played a part.",
        "Restrictions on trade played a part.",
        "There were a couple of parts of the world where the crop was smaller than usual.",
        "So there are many, many things interacting here.",

        "So, I mean, my preferred approach is to eat, you know, a small quantity of meat, but it's very good-quality meat.",

        "You argue that, in fact, well yes gold, but just as much spice.",
        "Yes, gold and spices.",

        "And he wants to find all these things because spices came from the East.",
        "And if you find them, that means you've found the East.",
        "And he was - he thought Cuba was Japan, and Japan was obviously just off the coast of China, and therefore you were almost there.",
        "So he looked around, trying to find these things.",
        "Now the big problem was that Europeans didn't know what spices looked like in the wild.",
        "They'd been told all these crazy things by traders going right back to ancient Greek times about how, you know, cinnamon sticks were used by giant birds to make their nests, and you had to gather some spices by wearing an all-over suit made of leather to protect you from the creatures that would - I mean, it was all completely rubbish.",
        "But it made people very curious about spices, prepared to pay a lot for them.",
        "And as a result, Columbus is trying to find a way around the Arab spice monopoly.",
        "And he thinks if you head West, then you'll be able to get to the Indies - which is true, of course, but he did all his sums wrong and made the Earth much smaller than it really was.",
        "So that's really what he's looking for, evidence that he's in Asia, in the Indies, and that he has found spices.",
        "But because he doesn't know what spices look like as they're growing, he's sure they're all around him, but he can't tell which trees are the nutmegs and where's the cinnamon.",
        "And his men think they found it, and they take all these twigs and so forth back to Spain and say look, here are the spices.",

        "The slave trade gets started, and Africans are taken over in large numbers to work on these new sugar plantations that are set up in the West Indies to produce sugar and send it back to Europe.",
        "So they don't find spices.",
        "So they do, instead, switch to the manufacturing of sugar.",

        "You do have these monocultures.",
        "They're more susceptible to disease, and this is a big problem.",
        "And there's a very nice example that comes from a particular kind of Turkish wheat that was collected.",
        "And the anthropologist who was collecting it said that he thought it was particularly useless, and he couldn't imagine why anyone would ever want to grow this kind of wheat.",
        "But it turned out that, in fact, the part of the world where I am now - it was called hopelessly useless by Jack Harlan, the American botanist who collected a sample in Turkey in 1948.",
        "But anyway, then there was this problem, a disease called stripe rust, which hit American wheat in the '60s, and it turned out that this Turkish wheat was immune to it.",
        "So they then crossed it and produced a new variety of wheat that could resist stripe rust.",
        "And now today, nearly all of the wheat grown in the Pacific Northwest is descended from that apparently useless kind of wheat.",
        "And so that's a classic example of how we need to protect the diversity of the seeds.",
        "We don't want to be reliant on monocultures.",
        "Ideally, we want to protect them by growing them, not just having to store them away in Norway.",

        "And in the longer term, if we don't deal with climate change or we're struck by an asteroid or there's a nuclear war or something like that, then, you know, getting humanity back on its feet is going to start with where we were 10,000 years ago.",
        "It's going to start with reestablishing agriculture.",
        "And so you can imagine an intrepid band of people heading off to that seed vault to get the seeds because they'll be stored for thousands of years, and you'll still be able to plant them.",
