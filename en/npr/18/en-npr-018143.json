        "I mean, just to give a simple example, after the switch from hunting and gathering to settled agriculture, that was the beginning of social structure.",
        "Hunter-gatherers were quite an egalitarian society, and settled societies, you could accumulate goods.",
        "Some people would accumulate more food than others.",
        "You start to get an elite appropriating the surplus food.",
        "You start to get the division of society into rich and poor.",
        "And we kind of assume it's normal now that you have rich and poor and everyone has a different job and so on.",
        "That's a huge shift from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, where it was much more egalitarian, as I say.",
        "And, in fact, Marx and Engels were inspired by hunter-gatherers when they were coming up with the idea of communism.",
        "They called them primitive communists.",
        "So there are all these aspects of that modern life that we just assume have to be the way that they are.",
        "And actually, if you look at why they are the way they are, it's because of food.",
        "And I don't think it's - I appreciate that this micro-history genre can sometimes go a bit far.",
        "I'm not saying that any single food is responsible.",
        "I'm saying food, the fuel of the human race, is also the fuel of history.",
        "Let's get Alice on the line, Alice with us from Pacifica, California.",
        "Hi.",
        "I taught a Spanish and Portuguese history class, and we read Columbus' first four letters.",
        "And as I recall, the first letter, he actually says he did find a spice, which was chili pepper.",
        "So he didn't find the ones he was looking for, but he did find one that actually, when the Portuguese started importing it to Asia, completely changed Asian cuisine because, of course, Indian and Southeast Asian food now has a lot of chili pepper, which is an American spice.",
        "Yeah, it's from the Americas.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And we assume that, you know, that all of that hot, spicy food must have always have been that way.",
        "But actually, chili is a very recent addition.",
        "The thing about the chili was it was great.",
        "It was superior to pepper in many respects, and the court was quite impressed with it back in Spain.",
        "But the reason Columbus was unexcited was that it wasn't one of the spices he was looking for, you know, the really, the valuable ones, the ones people were prepared to pay lots of money for.",
        "And the thing about the chili is you could transplant it very easily - as, in fact, immediately happened.",
        "So you could pretty much take it from one place and grow it in another place.",
        "And the thing about the spices was that they were much, much harder to move around.",
        "And when, in fact, the Spice Islands were eventually found, they were - there were specific islands where specific spices grew, and it took quite a while for people to figure out how to move them to other places.",
        "So one of the things that made spices valuable was this incredible small area that they came from and the fact that it was difficult to get them to grow elsewhere.",
        "And the thing that made the chili not so valuable by comparison - I mean, it was valuable as a food stuff, but it wasn't economically valuable - was the fact that it was so easy to get it to grow in places other than its place of origin.",
        "So, yes, I think in the long run, you know, the chili has proved to be, you know, more valuable in that respect.",
        "But it didn't have the sort of value that Columbus wanted it to have.",
        "Interesting."

        "When did humans start using spices, start developing optimal cooking techniques for enhancing flavor?",
        "That's a good question.",

        "Pliny the Elder was a grumpy Roman writer.",
        "And his generation hadn't grown up with pepper, but the increase of - the supply of pepper was dramatically increased to Europe during his lifetime, and people started to become very fond of it.",
        "And he just couldn't see what was going on here at all.",
        "He thought this was very strange.",
        "And furthermore, he had a bit of a sort of local food objection to it.",
        "He really couldn't understand why you had to pay so much to bring this food all the way from India, particularly given that he didn't like the taste of it.",
        "So there have always been, you know, new foods being introduced in new places and new techniques being developed and new fusions, and so on.",
        "And that's really, you know, that's been going on all the time, I think.",
        "I don't think there's a particular period where that hasn't happened.",
        "You do, however, puncture what you describe as the myth that Europeans were so interested in spices to cover the putrid flavor of rotted meat.",
        "Yeah.",
        "This is just not true.",
        "I mean, the thing is, spices were so expensive that this would be like using, you know, a hundred dollars of spices to cover up the taste of $5 of rotting meat.",
        "I mean, the spices were the far more expensive ingredient.",
        "So if you can afford the spices, you can afford fresh, good meat.",
        "But what the origin of it nay be that if the meat had been salted to preserve it, then you might have wanted to use spices to then cover up the taste of the salt.",
        "But the idea that it used to discover - sorry, to conceal the taste of rotting meat is just not correct.",

        "When the Europeans went in with a heavy meat and potatoes diet and alcohol, they were slaughtered by the Muslims in the beginning till they learned to adapt to a Middle Eastern diet of fruit, yogurt, dates, white meat, not to overcrowd your digestive system and die of heat stroke.",

        "And, in fact, Napoleon and Alexander the Great were as successful as they were because they were so good at coping with this aspect of logistics.",
        "I mean, it's very easy to overlook the fact that, you know, if your army doesn't get to the battlefield at all, then obviously you have no chance of victory.",

        "But, I mean, even in Roman times, there was a Roman writer who said that hunger is more savage than the sword and starvation destroys an army more often than does battle.",
        "And whoever does not fight, provide for food and other necessities is conquered without fighting.",
        "So it was a prerequisite of military victory that you dealt with food first.",

        "And we failed.",
        "And why was it?",
        "Well, essentially, we had to supply our troops by sea.",
        "They couldn't do the usual thing, which is draw food from the land, because doing so would have alienated the local farmers who we were trying to keep on side."

        "Yes.",
        "So, what happens in the Second World War is it suddenly becomes more important to feed machines than people, and it's getting the fuel and the ammunition to the frontline that becomes the really difficult logistical challenge.",
        "And food then shifts and it becomes an ideological weapon during the Cold War.",
        "So the Cold War starts with a food fight with the Berlin Airlift and the Blockade of Berlin, and so all of this food is flown in on planes.",
