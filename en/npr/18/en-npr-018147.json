        "It is very rare for scientists to voluntarily stop their research.",
        "But that's what happened back in January, because these mutant bird flu viruses sparked an unprecedented debate for biology.",
        "At first, the question was whether the details of how to make these viruses should be made public, or whether that would be like publishing the recipe for a bio-weapon.",
        "After closed-door national and international meetings, that issue is settled: science journals recently published the manuscripts.",

        "Not specifically.",
        "There's been a lot of questions certainly, even after the case, as to why the suit was brought.",
        "But I think fundamentally it was to force EPA to have to confront the issue and require EPA to regulate CO2 and other greenhouse gases coming out of the tailpipes of cars.",
        "Now that doesn't mean that the states don't have a role to play - and, in fact, the decision suggests states may even have a larger role to play - but that was not their initial reason for bringing the case."
