        "So let's talk exactly about what the court decided.",
        "Did they say that the EPA can regulate emissions or that it has to regulate emissions?",
        "What the court said was that greenhouse gases are air pollutants.",
        "And under the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required - and this is specific to cars and auto emissions - required to regulate if, in the judgment of the administrator, he determines that that air pollution might be endangering or reasonably anticipated to be endangering the public health or welfare.",
        "And welfare specifically includes climate and weather.",
        "So by saying it is a pollutant, then the EPA has to judge whether it's dangerous or not.",
        "That's right.",
        "That's the next step.",
        "EPA's got to roll up its sleeves now and get to the hard work of first making that determination and then, second, determining how and when it would regulate.",
        "Did the courts say what criteria it must use to make this decision?",
        "It did in a sort of a negative way, which is to say the criteria that EPA did use, things like policy considerations, whether or not it would interfere with CAFE standards, those were improper and the standards that the EPA had to use had to be those that were in the Clean Air Act itself.",
        "So this is going to be scientific judgment.",
        "EPA's going to have to explain either that it does - greenhouse gases do lead to this endangerment or why it does not or why there's so much uncertainty that they can't figure it out.",
        "Is there a deadline on this?",
        "No.",
        "So it could sit on its hands and say: Let the next administration do this.",
        "Well, you know, when we say there's no specified deadline, the court didn't impose a deadline.",
        "Agencies generally take a fair bit of time in getting to these things.",
        "I'd expect that the agency will have to get on this.",
        "Congress is already suggesting they're going to hold hearings to ensure that.",
        "But there's no hard and fast deadline."

        "Dr.",
        "Dorn, this ruling just was brought and was judged on tailpipe emissions, on car emissions, but would it apply now to smokestacks of power companies, things like that?",
        "Well the decision itself doesn't apply, but your question's a good one.",
        "There are currently two cases pending in the court of appeals, the court just below the Supreme Court, that are using the same logic to say that coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers are also emitting air pollutants under a different title of the Clean Air Act.",
        "And I think that it's going to be very hard for EPA to say that they don't also need to regulate those stationary sources, or at least that they don't have the authority to.",

        "Good.",
        "Venetians - V-E-N-E-T-I-A-N-S - plus L.",
        "Well the dissented - really there are two dissenting opinions, one written by Chief Justice Roberts, the other by Justice Scalia.",
        "Each one was joined by four of the dissenters.",
        "The first issue that Chief Justice Roberts wrote on very strong opinion really has to do with whether or not there are parties, including states like the state of Massachusetts or Washington state, that can bring this kind of a lawsuit.",
        "Should they be allowed to come into a federal court and challenge EPA's failure to act in this case?",
        "And Justice Roberts disagreed vehemently with the idea that states have a special role, which is what the majority found, and that there were the traditional factors that would allow a party to come into court.",
        "In other words, that there was an injury, in this case to the state of Massachusetts, that that injury was caused by global warming; and that even if it were that, there would be some way to redress or address that injury through this lawsuit.",
        "And the dissent and majority opinions are starkly different on each of those aspects.",
        "They also have a little bit of disagreement on the science.",
        "And I think that you can see that the majority opinion was very interested in the science and knew and showed an understanding of climate change science, concluding ultimately that the sea-level rise was in fact taking place, based on some affidavits that had been submitted, that sea-level rise would continue to harm Massachusetts, and that the risk of harm would in fact be reduced if EPA took action.",
        "Chief Justice Roberts disagreed on every single point, and in particular pointed to the idea that there's a lot of speculation in this.",
        "One, he didn't believe that the affidavits were more than just conclusions as to harm and that there weren't other possible reasons for the inundation of the coastline.",
        "And second - and this is very interesting from a science perspective - he pointed out that there are many different compounding relationships and to understand climate change is very difficult.",
        "And he wasn't persuaded that that was an immediate enough harm or that you could demonstrate causation using that kind of a climate-change model.",
        "So he wasn't swayed by that last IPCC report which said there was a 90 percent certainty?",
        "Apparently not from a legal perspective, although again it's interesting to see the majority does cite to the international reports.",
        "They cite to things like using ice cores.",
        "So there seems to be a difference at least as it's applied in the law.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "I work on this everyday, and it's somewhat depressing to see these reports come out over and over again with more and more compelling statements.",
        "It is the most compelling statement that we've had yet on impacts, endorsed by over 130 countries, including our own.",
        "And it finds that we are already seeing impacts to both physical and biological systems from climate change and that these impacts can be linked with human activities, with greenhouse gas emissions, as you've been discussing with your previous guest.",
        "And what kinds of things should we expect from the continuation and the worsening of global warming?",
        "Well, for example, in North America, we can expect decreased water availability in the West, forest disturbances from fire and pest and insects as trees are more vulnerable, more heat waves in cities.",
        "Coastal systems are vulnerable, and that's both the natural systems and the seafood that we rely on from the wetlands but also the communities and huge infrastructure that we have on the nation's coast.",
        "They're vulnerable both to sea-level rise from climate change, because the water literally expands with the warming globe, and then also because of the melting glaciers and ice around the world.",
        "And then also they're vulnerable because more intense storms that could be associated with warming of the waters.",

        "Well, we're happy to see the Supreme Court acknowledge that greenhouse gases are a problem, and it was a very sweeping strong statement by the Supreme Court.",
        "But I do think that this outcome is going to lead to more discussions here in Washington of what a more comprehensive climate change policy should look like.",

        "We, in fact, have several sources of greenhouse gas pollution in this country and other greenhouse gases.",
        "And so there are a lot of bills pending in Congress and we think that this will serve to stimulate more movement on that front.",
        "Linda Mearns, what's in this IPCC report that's so different from the last one?",
        "And really, surprising support from a number of CEOs including some who joined with our organization, the Pew Center on Global Climate Change and other NGOs in U.S.",

        "I think the burgeoning evidence on seeing observed effects of the climate change that we've seen already is really very striking.",
        "There was a bit of that in the 2001 report, but the evidence is much, much stronger now that we're seeing effects on our biological systems and our resources.",

        "Are they going to take action already to do something about it?",
