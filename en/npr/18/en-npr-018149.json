        "On the other hand, there was a report out this week, an online version of the journal Science, which talked about the tremendous drought that's predicted for the Southwest United Sates returning to the dust bowl days of the '30s.",
        "Yes, I read that report, and those results - they go into more detail, but they're completely in agreement with what we wrote in Working Group One for that region, the projections.",
        "It's already experienced a droughty period, and from our analyses, that will continue into the future.",
        "And I think there's definitely a nontrivial chance of having mega droughts again as they occurred thousands of years ago.",
        "Well I guess the point I'm trying to make is that's the fastest-growing part of the United States.",
        "Yes, and that's another aspect that is really brought out in this report more, which is that in the future there's really going to be a combination of factors that will be difficult to handle.",
        "This is known as multiple stressors.",
        "So it won't just be population, although that will be a very important driver of resource use, but it will be population increase, land use changes, on top of the climate change.",
        "And we'll have to be dealing with all those problems together.",
        "And that's certainly very important for a system like water resources in all of the west.",
        "Let's go to Dennis in Rochester, New York.",
        "Hi, Dennis.",
        "Yes.",
        "Hi.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, I've read the Supreme Court opinion and - on climate change and what we can and cannot regulate.",
        "And it's obvious from reading their opinion that the justices are not deciding this on a legal basis.",
        "They're deciding it just on their own political views.",
        "And, for example, if you look at Roberts' dissention, you could use the logic that he uses to say that we ought to build all of our power plants on the east shore.",
        "And then at the - as their effluence and the toxic gases go away from the United States, since we're only 20 percent of the greenhouse gases, why, no one has any standing and nothing to worry about."

        "I think the incentives are just building.",
        "Even looking at this case and then taking it to the next level, if in fact this were to be applied to other stationary sources, I think, most people recognize that it's not a very efficient manner to go about regulating.",
        "As Vicky mentioned, you're looking at sector by sector.",

        "I think the other thing that's a factor is, you know, we're seeing a variety of states including those led by Republicans like, you know, Governor Schwarzenegger, obviously, in California is a leading example.",

        "And you think that legislation will aim to cap or cap-and-trade CO2 emissions?",
        "Well, I - Well, that's not my expertise, but I would say that this kind of problem - yes, it's nice if you can just motivate people with a carrot, but at some point, I think, some mandatory taxes on something about it will probably be necessary."
