        "I'd like to say that the reduction in the confidence - okay, that did happen, but I really doubt that it's going to significantly change policymakers' perception of the state of the climate-change issue.",

        "I'm Ira Flatow.",
        "We're talking this hour about climate change and the new report from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change just came out today.",
        "If you're just joining us, the report predicts increased hunger, water shortages, massive floods and many on the world's people - in fact, some of the people hit the most hardest around the world are predicted to be the people who can least afford it.",
        "The people - most hungry people and people ill-suited to be able to cope with that.",
        "The wrangling over the IPCC report continued late into the night yesterday in Brussels as scientist and a government representative disagreed on what should be included in the report and my next guest Darren Samuelsohn, writes in his own blog on Greenwire that he - there was some point where it may not have come out, Daniel, right - I'm sorry, Darren, that the report may not have seen the light of day today.",
        "That's right.",
        "So they were there all night last night.",
        "They were working late into the night.",
        "On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, but - I'm sorry, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday they actually stayed in all night.",
        "And it was a closed door discussion, so you're - as a reporter you're not standing in the room.",
        "So you're relaying on people coming out to talk you about it.",
        "- two Americans, one - I'm sorry, one American from the NASA Goddard Center in New York City; and then an Australian, who - a meteorologist, who is actually based now at University of Oklahoma; and a third, a glacier scientist from Chile, who all objected when Saudi Arabia and China wanted to take out some of the percentages of certainty that had been put into a draft that was proposed earlier in the week, the initial report that went before this team of government scientist.",
        "Set of government experts, I should say.",
        "So they wanted - they did not want the heavy language included.",
        "They wanted to water it down a little bit.",

        "The Chinese and the Saudi Arabians, this whole process works by consensus.",
        "That's right.",
        "And what happens was if anyone wants to - any government wants to speak up and say, you know, that they disagree with something they can question the scientists who are sitting there, kind of, like, you might sort of defend your thesis.",
        "These scientists who have written this report over the last three, four years sit up in a table and are defending it from questions from the government officials.",

        "Basically there was a comment right up in page two of this report, sort of, the very, very first bold - sort of, jump-out-at-you-and-grab-you paragraph - had said originally that the evidence from the science over the last many years showed that there was a high level of confidence that what you are seeing, what you're seeing in all continents on the globe and from the oceans, you're seeing changes related to global warming at a regional scale.",
        "And that high confidence number that was in there would have been an eight in 10 share - or an eight in 10 probability of it.",

        "So it was an example where the United States was, I think, talking with the Saudi Arabians and the Chinese trying to at least get something together in this report.",

        "But also, an important thing to keep in mind is the original paragraph, the one that was in the draft, will be in the final document.",

        "I must say the fact that these, my colleagues, had to work pretty much through the night was really stretching it to a cliffhanger, but there's always some tension around that.",
        "I think the reason why there was more tension this time is because the stakes have gone up.",
        "Because the whole issue is being taken more seriously, it's not just sort of a lawyerly game anymore because we're now looking at what are we going to do about this problem.",
        "So it makes sense to me that this report in particular would be more difficult.",
        "Well, listening in on an earlier press conference they had today, it's - this doesn't really change their policy, because they think the policy of, you know, voluntary efforts by the administration and support for technology is enough, and it's certainly not enough from a standpoint of what's happening with greenhouse-gas emissions and the continued growth in those emissions.",

        "And they have already, even before this decision, in recent months been up on the Hill and been talking, you know, somewhat more constructively than in the past.",
        "You know what happens many times in the history of this country, is people may want to do something that Congress may want to change, but who really controls what happens is the insurance industry.",
        "You know, if the insurance industry decides they're not going to insure your home because you're living in a soon-to-be desert, people may not live in - may not be able to get an insurance policy to move there, or you're going to be in a floodplain on the East Coast someplace underwater in 100 years.",
        "Where does the insurance - don't you think the insurance industry - you know, they had a lot to say about the future of nuclear power after Three Mile Island.",
        "Well, I think it's certainly a factor, and I'm a New Orleans native, and I've been spending a lot of time there lately, and if you see what's going on with the rebuilding, I think it's an example of how adaptation is not necessarily all that easy.",
        "It's more like coping and muddling through when you have these kinds of events, but you do see insurance companies in some cases pulling out, and in certainly in many cases really raising their rates dramatically."

        "But unfortunately, they're not getting a lot of guidance on this front.",

        "Those confidence levels are arrived at through consensus, and I would say it's done in the form of an expert judgment.",
        "In other words, these scientists know a great a deal about the problem in their particular chapter.",
