        "It was actually published in '96, and then a year later, the first-ever mandatory emissions treaty was passed by the United Nations, and then the first one in 1990, often people refer to that one and say that that led to the underlying framework that sort of got the whole United Nations process moving and led to the Kyoto Protocol.",
        "And now the United Nations is going to be meeting in Indonesia later this year, as well, and that meeting will be trying to determine what to do when the Kyoto Protocol expires in the year 2012.",
        "Businesses want to know what's going to happen off into the future.",
        "I'm actually here in Europe right now doing a whole series of stories trying to figure out what the Europeans are planning to do, and a lot of them are looking over to California, to the United States, to the Northeastern states, to give a signal of what kind of emission cuts can be expected out in the end of the next decade.",
        "That's interesting.",
        "They're not looking to the federal government.",
        "They're looking toward the states.",
        "Well right now, the states are the only ones that are interested in capping emissions.",
        "I mean, you're seeing it from the Democrats in Congress, but right now, California and its neighboring Western states - five of them altogether, and then British Columbia - have all agreed to cap and trade their emissions starting later this decade.",
        "And then you have the nine Northeastern states and Maryland capping their emissions.",
        "So there's actually, you know, laws and regulations in place for these states.",
        "And actually earlier this week, I was with the California EPA secretary, Linda Adams, who works for Governor Schwarzenegger.",

        "officials trying to line up and match up their emission targets, and maybe at some point link up their systems, even without the U.S.",
        "government involved.",
        "So is it possible, Vicki Arroyo, for them to make an end around the federal government?",
        "Well, it's somewhat complicated for states to engage in trading with the EU, for example, because Kyoto really precludes trading with uncapped countries.",
        "So they'll have to figure out how to get around some of the barriers to doing this at sort of a sub-national level, but I should say in response to what Darren said about the support of the Democrats in Congress, the truth is that one of the leaders on this issue was McCain.",
        "There's been a McCain-Lieberman bill for some time about capping U.S.",
        "emissions or limiting emissions to a certain level and then allowing for trading, as we've done successfully here with the acid rain program, as they're doing with the EU successfully.",
        "And now, several other senators and even folks in the House have similar proposals.",
        "So I do think that we're likely to see much more debate and hopefully passage in the next couple of years of a federal scheme that then can link up with some of those global programs.",
        "Certainly for McCain, if not for the other presidential candidates, something to run on."
