        "Godlin's using a forklift to move sage flower honey around his warehouse.",
        "He's had hives stolen in the past.",
        "For him, it's not just the bee rental fees that are lost when hives are stolen.",
        "It's also what the bees produce themselves.",
        "So this is what it looks like.",
        "It's a big, sticky mess.",
        "So we've got to get this all out of these combs and into a barrel.",
        "For many beekeepers, honey is a second income in addition to the pollination fees, so when bees are stolen they lose out on both sources of income.",
        "Godlin says it takes time to develop a new hive by introducing a new queen and developing honey.",
        "Bees - you know, we have been hit by everything from vandals to bears to thieves.",
        "But the vandalism and the thieving is the worst, you know, the one that hurts the most.",
        "Godlin says his organization will pay a reward of up to $10,000 for tips leading to the prosecution of bee thieves, but that only relieves some of the sting.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Ezra David Romero in Fresno.",
        "And his allegiance to those fanatics and terrorists never faltered.",
        "Not even with the knowledge that they had murdered thousands of his countrymen and not finally in the prison uprising that took the life of CIA agent Johnny Spann.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, you know, the king is one of the dwindling number of Arab leaders who are opposed to the Muslim Brotherhood.",
        "They see - he sees, in particular, what he calls a Muslim Brotherhood crescent rising over the Middle East.",
        "And he told me about his meeting with Morsi.",
        "And he came to the conclusion that Morsi is, quote, \"\"out of his depth.\"\" That's what he said.",
        "They were talking about the peace process, and I think the king was trying to have a sophisticated discussion with him about steps that could be taken.",
        "And Morsi was just sort of excoriating the Israelis over and over again.",
        "And Abdullah said, fine, fine; but let's work on the Palestinian side, and see if we can get the Palestinian factions together.",
        "And I think he just wasn't impressed.",
        "And of course, that's against the background of not trusting the Muslim Brotherhood.",
        "He feels that the Muslim Brotherhood is trying to subvert his monarchy.",
        "That comment from the Royal Court that you've commented on already, the most sensitive point there seemed to be statements attributed to the king of Jordan about Jordanians; about tribal leaders, for example.",
        "We love - the king loves all Jordanians, I think it says."

        "Fair?",
        "Fair - not complete, but that's fair.",

        "Even though he's a king, a hereditary monarch, he is a reformer.",
        "He wants to devolve some of his power, to the people.",
        "He wants a parliament that is filled with parties that are parties based on ideas rather than tribal affiliation or patronage mills, or that sort of thing.",
        "There are a lot of people in Jordan who obviously blame him for not engineering these kind of changes as adeptly as he could, or as quickly as he could.",
        "But yes, there is a level of frustration with the political system.",
        "There is a level of frustration with the sort of people who are, in his mind, mainly in politics to preserve their privileges.",
        "And his own family members who overdo their own royal privileges, the intelligence service - he was quite critical of lots of people, in this interview.",
        "Well, you know, I've known him for 15 years; and I've always known him to be very candid.",
        "I also think of him as very canny.",
        "And I say that very specifically because he did not say these things to me by accident.",
        "And one of the ways he communicates to different parties, is through the press.",
        "And I think he is somewhat frustrated with certain members of his family.",
        "Look, there is a serious issue of corruption in Jordan.",
        "And I took his statements about his family as the king throwing a brush-back pitch - to use a baseball metaphor in the Middle East; that he was signaling to his people, and to the world, that he is not going to tolerate the usual shenanigans that one expects in the Middle East by royals or by people in power, generally.",
        "Jeffrey Goldberg, bottom line, did Jordan - when you were there, and when you were interviewing the king - did it strike you as a place where the regime is relatively secure?",
        "Or is it next country up for an Arab revolution?",
        "The conventional wisdom is that it's the next country up for revolution.",
        "I don't believe that, necessarily.",
        "You know, here's one way to judge: The opposition in Jordan has never been able to muster large rallies on the street.",
        "The king is a very different person than Bashar al-Assad or Hosni Mubarak.",
        "He is much more attuned to the needs and frustrations of his people than other leaders in the Middle East.",
        "And here's one, final point about this.",
        "The people of Jordan look to the north; they see Syria becoming a charnel house.",
        "They looked to the east and see Anbar Province, of Iraq.",
        "They see Gaza.",
        "They see Egypt.",
        "And all of this instability has created in Jordan, I think, a new appreciation for stability.",
        "And the king and his government deliver stability.",
        "It is still a nice place, comparative to the rest of the region.",
        "And so, I don't think that he's in the sort of trouble that some people think he's in."

        "We did, in fact, find several specific genetic variations that seemed to increase the risk for all five of these different disorders.",

        "They are not destiny - that is, it doesn't account for all of the risk.",
        "But it turns out that all the psychiatric disorders and neuropsychiatric disorders that have been studied so far have demonstrated some genetic component.",

        "One is that it suggests that there may be some degree of shared biology among these very different disorders that affect the brain.",

        "I mean, are we talking about testing tools or about the treatment for these mental disorders?",
        "Well, that's a good question and in fact it's important to emphasize that we are not talking about testing tools here.",
        "These are actually a small fraction, we think, of the genetic component of each of these disorders.",
        "What it does do is point us in the direction of novel kinds of biological clues that could then be targets for treatment.",
        "And so, this then begins a process of looking for ways to translate that information into something that might actually be helpful to folks.",
        "So now that you have this information, do you think it will change how people think or treat these disorders?",
        "Well, one of the interesting things is that our current system of classifying psychiatric disorders is really just based on symptoms rather than causes.",
        "And I think studies like this one, in conjunction with studies of brain imaging and behavior and so on, may help us begin to look at these disorders in a different way, to begin to understand them and maybe ultimately diagnose them based on their root causes rather than their symptoms.",
