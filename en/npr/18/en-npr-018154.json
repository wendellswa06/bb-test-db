        "In contrast, Kagan's praise of the former Israeli Chief Justice appears to be from her introduction of him when he spoke at Harvard, a kind of praise she's also heaped on conservative speakers at Harvard, like Justice Antonin Scalia.",

        "Kagan will undoubtedly say that she did oppose the military's don't ask, don't tell policy, but that her job as dean was to ensure that nobody was the victim of discrimination on campus - neither gay students nor those interested in being military lawyers.",
        "She'll seek to persuade senators that she tried to steer a middle course that allowed military recruiters on campus, but did not give them access to the school's office of career services.",
        "Republicans, too, will focus on the 170,000 documents and emails from Kagan's four-year tenure in the Clinton White House.",

        "Expect Kagan to use those answers as her model.",
        "Probably Kagan's biggest problem will be that, as a scholar, she was acidly critical of the cliched and unresponsive answers of previous nominees during their Supreme Court confirmation hearings.",
        "The process, she wrote, has taken on a, quote, \"\"air of vacuity and farce, in part because senators have gotten away from the essential rightness, the legitimacy and the desirability of exploring a Supreme Court nominee's set of constitutional views and commitments.\"\" So expect senators to ask Kagan to live up to her own standard.",
        "For the last seven weeks, Kagan has been prepping for these hearings -studying, spending hours in mock sessions, grilled by White House staffers playing the role of senators.",
        "Her handlers are trying to get her to slow down her answers, to take time to think before replying, and to whack out of her a streak of what even her friends admit can sound like arrogance.",

        "Justice Stephen Breyer has said the best advice he got when he was prepped for his confirmation hearing came from veteran politico Michael Berman.",
        "Supreme Court nominees, Berman observed, are used to being the smartest kids in the room - not a good tactic at a confirmation hearing.",
