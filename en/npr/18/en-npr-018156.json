        "You said you also wanted to document the price here.",
        "What was the price that was being paid by the families?",
        "Well, one of the things that we found that was very difficult for the families was that OSHA - which is the agency that investigates the accidents - one of the things that we found that they were doing was withdrawing citations, have an informal conference, and without a lot of explanation, they would withdraw the citations.",
        "So somebody dies, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration fines and cites safety violations, and then some guys talk quietly among themselves and all of a sudden the citations go away?",
        "That's exactly what happens.",

        "A lot of it is your own thoughts and your own analysis of things.",
        "But I think that there's also still a really important role for reporting, which just means calling people up, asking them questions, finding documents.",
