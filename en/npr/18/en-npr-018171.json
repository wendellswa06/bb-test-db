        "In the black box of A.R.T., young actors and technicians learn to create something out of nothing, to build entire worlds out of wood and fabric and words, to imagine themselves into the future.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Julie Burstein.",
        "As a growing rift divides evangelical Christians, two evangelical professors published an op-ed in The New York Times this week that denounced the anti-intellectualism of fundamentalists who embrace what they described as discredited, ridiculous, even dangerous ideas.",
        "They described a parallel culture nurtured by church, Sunday school, summer camps and colleges, as well as publishing houses, broadcast networks, music festivals and counseling groups, all in response to what they see as a secular conspiracy: gay marriage, the elimination of prayer at public school, a growing acceptance of atheism.",
        "We want to hear from evangelicals in our audience.",

        "Thanks very much for coming in today.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "And where do you see anti-intellectualism among fundamental evangelicals?",
        "Well, it's been very visible in the GOP candidates, most of whom are reaching out to an evangelical base.",
        "And the mere fact that, you know, accepting science and believing in evolution can make you into a maverick on that stage is quite alarming.",
        "So it's been highly visible in the GOP discussion.",
        "But what's important for people to understand is that people like Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry, and so on, are reflecting views which are held by tens of millions of American evangelicals and thought to be relatively unproblematical.",
        "In fact, is this the mainstream of evangelical thought?",
        "Yes.",
        "This is what the polls show, that the majority of people would agree with Rick Perry that if there's something wrong with the theory of evolution, we don't really need to take it too seriously.",
        "So the fact that, literally, tens of millions of Americans think the Earth is 10,000 years old is quite alarming.",
        "I was just thinking about that little news item we read - the spear tip, 13,800 years old, in a mastodon's bone.",

        "And anti-intellectualism, is this not simply saying, wait a minute, we have different beliefs, or is this simply saying what - proven fact, we're just ignoring it, we're just putting blinders on?",
        "Well, it's important to recognize that there's nothing intrinsic to evangelicalism that requires embracing these odd positions.",
        "And for, you know, a hundred years prior to the modern creationist movement, most evangelical Christians were OK with the geologists telling them that the Earth was much older than the Bible suggested.",

        "I mean, are you thinking about, you know, the people in the Gulf, the businesses, you know, how this has, you know, hurt a region of the country, or are you just very focused on the mechanics?",
