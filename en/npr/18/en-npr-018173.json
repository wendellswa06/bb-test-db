        "And this culture, you describe it as being almost a reaction to the growth of secular society.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Most people don't think there's anything dangerous or sinister about praying, but the fact that praying gets outlawed from the public schools can make it look like religion is not being sort of merely separated, but religion is being undermined and marginalized, and that can feel threatening.",
        "And so many people would rather send their children to a school where they could pray before class.",
        "Or home-school them.",

        "I mean, I think there is even - as your guest was stating earlier - in these evangelical universities, there are these areas where they are looking into - looking at scientific reason, looking at research and data and not just going off of tradition.",
        "And I think, really, what the issue comes from is not necessarily the true orthodoxy of the Christian faith that they hold, but I think more of these extra-scriptural moralities and even hot-button points, that there can be no compromise on, that I think it's almost something to where the foundation of one's faith, when it is seen as something that is reduced down to into talking points than when - when one of those talking points is challenged, when that's the only foundation that you have, then you really can't move on past that."

        "There's a very real sense in which there are hot-button items, but, unfortunately, these hot-button items, I think, have been manipulated by leaders looking to kind of build coalitions.",
        "They're not always, like, authentic biblical or traditionally Christian concerns.",

        "I certainly agree.",
        "And I think what - where some of that - the party lines can be drawn with that manipulation, I think are - whereas it's almost picking one issue over the other, where, you know, as a Christian, you can see that there is a biblical mandate for, you know, caring for the poor and caring for the needy.",
        "And - whereas you might be, you know, wanting to align yourself with one certain political party or political force, also, your faith on another hot-button issue would be something like abortion, whereas you may want to align yourself with somebody politically who would want to, you know, have policies in place that would take care, you know, that would - things that would match up with your faith on - sometimes there can be that issue of no compromise.",
        "And many times, I find it is just that one thing of maybe not even necessarily gay marriage in some circles, but usually the ethic of human life and how that is treated with abortion rights.",

        "And, of course, the offset of that is if God wants to take eight billion years to create Earth and tell Moses, I did it in seven days, well, that's fine.",
        "We don't see any problem with that.",
        "And the other subset is man is a part of nature, and the creation of the soul of man is the realm of faith.",
        "So would your guest care to comment on those things?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, you're absolutely right.",
        "And I think you're illustrating the point I made earlier, that there are resources and movements and denominations within even conservative evangelicalism that are able to make peace with all of these different controversial topics.",
        "So, I mean, you're absolutely right.",
        "I mean, there's just no need whatsoever to be saying, look, to be a Christian, you've got to think of the Earth as being 10,000 years old.",
        "I mean, that's simply not reasonably made an article of faith.",
        "They sure make a big deal of it, but I think at the root of it is their failure to conceive that God created time and, therefore, is the master of it.",

        "And if you look at what Ken Ham does with Answers n Genesis or what the Discovery Institute does with Intelligent Design and so on, they make so many negative comments about how scientists are biased, how science is all about the assumptions that you bring to the data rather than the objective examination of the data.",
        "They make a big deal about scientific revolutions in the past that have overturned well-established ideas, and so on.",
