        "It's so hard to go in there.",
        "It's a very tightly - the buildings are very close together and what apparently we understand happened here was that American ground forces met with more resistance in the eastern corner of the slum than they expected and they called on air support.",
        "And in the aftermath of this air attack, they say 30 suspected terrorists were killed and 12 others were detained.",
        "Meanwhile, people in Sadr City, including police and people who belong to the Sadr City local office, say that there were no 30 terrorists killed; there were actually nine civilians killed and among those were women and children, and there were also six people that were injured.",
        "And tell us more about this supposed link with Iran and the supposed weapons smuggling.",
        "Well, this is something that the American military has been pushing for some time.",
        "They repeatedly assert that they have evidence that Iran is supplying, arming, funding, training Iraqi militants in Iran to attack American forces.",
        "And one of the particular weapons that they have been using the Americans call a explosively formed penetrator, which is a very sophisticated piece of weaponry that is able to pierce armed cars and the Humvees, which basically has resulted in more spectacular attacks, they're able to instead of just slightly damaging the vehicles actually destroy the vehicles and kill everyone inside.",
        "So they're much more deadly.",
        "The Americans say they see an increased use of them.",
        "And in fact in the last month, the American military says that attacks from Shiite militias, believed to be sponsored, in some way or another, by Iran, has accounted for about two-thirds of the U.S.",
        "troop deaths, especially in the last month.",
        "Jamie, meanwhile, though, there are some diplomatic conversations going on between the U.S.",
        "and Iran.",
        "What's going on there?",
        "I think they're trying to do things politically as well as militarily.",

        "that gun bans were prohibited by the Second Amendment.",
        "Yes.",
        "And this decision takes it one step more and says that the Second Amendment applies to cities and states.",
        "Now, you may have had the commonsensical view that Washington, D.C.",
        "is a city.",
        "But since it's considered a federal city and not a state, the court didn't actually decide on that case two years ago whether the Second Amendment really was a national right that affected cities and states, as well as the federal government, and that's really what was decided today.",
        "So this decision really knocks away a barrier to gun owners and others who want to challenge gun restrictions nationwide - municipal laws, county laws, state laws and/or federal laws."
