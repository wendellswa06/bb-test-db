        "We know very well that there are multiple Muslim sects in Iraq.",
        "There are also Christian groups.",
        "And in the northern city of Mosul, thousands of Christian families have been chased from their homes.",
        "Many are living with relatives or taking refuge in churches in an area north of the city that's known as the Nineveh Plain.",
        "They're struggling to adapt, and they're still debating who was responsible for driving them out.",
        "NPR's Corey Flintoff reports from Iraq.",
        "Here's how the religious cleansing in Mosul took place.",
        "First, graffiti appeared on the walls in Christian neighborhoods, \"\"Get out or die.\"\" Young men drove through the streets with loudspeakers, shouting at people to leave.",
        "Then the killing started.",
        "(Through Translator) My brother came home from work that day.",
        "He went to a nearby shop where suddenly gunmen turned up and asked him for his ID.",
        "Then they told his friends to step aside.",
        "They shot him dead and left.",
        "This is a 44-year-old Christian who identifies himself only as Abu Sara.",
        "He and his family are staying with relatives in a Christian community north of Mosul.",
        "Abu Sara is a mathematics teacher, and he weighs his words carefully.",
        "(Arabic spoken)",
        "He says it's difficult to be certain why the attacks are taking place now.",
        "American commanders have said they could be the work of Islamist militants.",
        "But Abu Sara says the word among Christians in Mosul is that the Kurds may have a hand in it.",
        "He says all the attacks on Christians happened on the side of the city that's dominated by Kurdish troops, yet the Kurds did nothing to stop them.",
        "Um Reyan is a Christian woman whose family is now taking refuge in an Assyrian Catholic church.",
        "(Through Translator) We heard the people from another Christian neighborhood describing how these armed men stormed the houses and shouted at people to get out.",
        "They were speaking in a kind of pidgin Arabic, not like a Mosul accent at all, but like Kurds trying to speak Arabic.",
        "These are startling observations coming from people who are, in effect, living on Kurdish generosity.",
        "The settlement where Abu Sara and his family are staying was built by the finance minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government.",
        "The church where Um Reyan is safe is also receiving money from the autonomous Kurdish zone.",
        "Why would the Kurds be involved in attacking Christians in Mosul, yet protecting them once they've been displaced to the Nineveh Plain area?",
        "The Nineveh Plains is these people's ancestral homeland.",
        "But in today's Iraq, it is an area contested by the Kurdistan Regional Government seeking to absorb that territory in an expanded KRG, and these people are caught in the middle of it."

        "You'd have to take a gun safety course and, of course, be fingerprinted, and it's fairly expensive and that type of thing.",
        "But the funny thing about that is on the other side of that coin, all a businessman has to do is put a sign on his door that says no handguns or no concealed weapons, and if you accidentally bring it in there, you're in great violation of the law.",
        "That was just a comment I wanted to make that I heard.",
