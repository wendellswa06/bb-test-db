        "And the fact that the Supreme Court has just said there's no First Amendment right here wouldn't change the law or the status quo for sports clubs.",

        "They're saying the priests work for Rome and therefore they are not liable priests and the bishops and the cardinals.",
        "Now, they say the priests work for Boston or whatever, not for the Vatican and therefore, the Vatican is not liable.",
        "And the suit, as I understand it, David, alleges that the Vatican or Vatican officials were part of the conspiracy of shifting priests around to various dioceses.",
        "Yes.",
        "And the suit did name a lot of different I think it named a Catholic archbishop in Chicago and it named a Holy See in Rome.",
        "And I think the, as I say, the Holy See wanted to establish early on in this case that you can't hand down a money judgment against the church in Rome.",

        "When you hear terms like adventurism -in fact, reckless adventurism was the term used - albeit by an unnamed Saudi, for them, this is strong language, and I think it reflects the extent of their alarm at the current crisis in the Middle East.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "And Justice Stevens gave a few lines about how much he had honored to serve on the court for so many years, how many wonderful friends he had.",
        "He finished with this last line, is: If I have overstayed my welcome, it is because this is such a unique and wonderful job.",
        "And I thought it was a funny way of stating, Stevens is such a gentleman, he stayed nearly 35 years.",
        "It sort of ends with an apology for having possibly stayed too long.",
        "And I think anybody who's watched the court and watched him knows he didn't stay too long.",
