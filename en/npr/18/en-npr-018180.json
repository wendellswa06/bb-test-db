        "It was 22 months after the communist takeover, and Lobo knew his luck would soon run out.",

        "And so, when he arrived to meet the young revolutionary - Guevara was just 32 years old at the time - he didn't quite know what to expect.",

        "And in time, I came to see Lobo as a kind of machine with which to explore the pre-revolutionary period.",

        "He was born in 1898, the year that the Spanish left Cuba after the War in Independence, and then he left the Cuban Republic in 1960, shortly after his meeting with Che Guevara.",
        "And because he was so rich and so powerful and so intimately involved in the island's most important industry, which is sugar, his life becomes this vehicle to tell the story of pre-revolutionary Cuba.",
        "Let's start out with his early life.",
        "At the age of 21, you describe he was just out of college.",
        "He went to Louisiana State University in the U.S., actually, to study the sugar industry.",

        "Was that the beginning of what would become his sugar empire?",
        "That was his first big move.",
        "At the time, it was the world's biggest sugar deal, and he stole it from under the nose of a sugar merchant in Cuba called Manuel Rionda, very powerful figure and part of the London trading firm Czarnikow-Rionda.",
        "And I think it was that trade which gave Lobo the confidence - he'd been ambitious ever since a child - to think that he really could become Sugar King.",
