        "Otherwise, it didn't count, in his view.",
        "Cuba was extremely corrupt, and there were these rebel groups that I just mentioned.",
        "And supposedly, he refused to pay $50,000 in protection money and as a result of that was mowed down in a style that is very reminiscent of a Chicago-style assassination attempt during the Prohibition Era.",
        "And of course, he survived that but barely, right?",
        "It was a very close call.",
        "He always walked with a limp afterwards.",
        "He, through the rest of his life, he had some shrapnel very close to his spine, and one bullet plowed through his skull and took four inches of bone off.",
        "You're hearing John Paul Rathbone.",
        "He's the author of the new book \"\"The Sugar King of Havana.\"\" It's a biography of a man named Julio Lobo who at one time was the richest man in Cuba.",
        "You write that Julio Lobo was different.",
        "He was obviously a capitalist and a successful one.",
        "But it wasn't so cut and dry, and you write about this class of people, the so-called Cuban bourgeoisie, who are obviously vilified by the Castro regime today, but they were not necessarily pro-Fulgencio Batista and his regime.",
        "They opposed his rule, but they also opposed the idea of communism.",
        "And Julio Lobo was, I guess, a prime example of that, right?",
        "The vast majority of Cubans on the island, including the wealthy and the well-to-do, opposed Batista.",
        "And why not?",
        "He'd taken power in a coup in 1952.",
        "He was corrupt.",
        "The mafia was a rising influence.",
        "There was not very much that anyone really liked about him.",
        "So when Fidel Castro came along, and he's a romantic figure, he's in the Sierra, he's with his rebels, they want to bring down Batista, but that didn't necessarily mean communism at the time.",
        "The idea that the upper classes in Cuba were opposed to Fidel Castro, or more accurately, that they didn't want Batista out is wrong.",
        "And there were various ways in which the upper-middle classes supported the rebels, if not Fidel Castro's, others', or some Fidel Castro himself, as Lobo did."

        "Well, he's offered more than a job.",
        "He's offered basically the sugar industry in Cuba.",
        "And he's offered the chance to rationalize it and make it hum and become efficient in the way that Lobo actually had often agitated for in the past.",
        "Lobo at this time is '62, and he replies to Guevara that, I'm a capitalist and you're a communist, and I've been a capitalist all my life.",
        "Tell me about the day that he left Cuba for good.",
        "He, after his interview with Che Guevara, he went home, and he that was when he realized that, in fact, everything was over.",
        "And he was he spent the night more or less immobilized in his bedroom.",
        "He locked the door, and then he finally recovered himself the next day and went to his office in Old Havana.",
        "And when he went there, he went into his office to gather up some papers, but everything was boarded up, and there was a young boy sitting in olive green uniform in his chair with his feet up on the desk.",
        "And this young boy said to Lobo, now we've got you where you want you, that's to say naked, i.e., stripped of all his possessions.",
        "And Lobo, who was very witty, shot back immediately, Chico, I was born naked, I will die naked, and some of my happiest moments have been naked.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And then he turned on his heel and marched off.",
        "And that - and later that day, he took a flight to Mexico and went to New York.",
        "And he actually - he was fully invested in Cuba, so he only had very few assets outside the island, and he set about trying to remake his fortune."
