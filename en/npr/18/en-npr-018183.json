        "Mueller said in his view the use of the Internet in recruitment is the most dangerous wrinkle in all of this.",
        "Everybody will tell you that the Internet, the influence of the Internet, not just in radicalization, but moving from radicalization to organization to undertaking terrorist attacks is the greatest, most serious phenomenon that has resulted, I believe, in many of the radicalization cases we've seen in the United States.",

        "Many in the president's own party want even tougher measures to stop illegal immigrants.",
        "One leading House Republican, Duncan Hunter of California, has proposed building a fence along the entire US-Mexican border, but Chertoff says tighter security will only do so much, that it needs to be paired with President Bush's plan to allow immigrants into the country as guest workers."

        "There is a tremendous pull on migration by the demand for workers in this country.",
        "If we don't address that demand, we are putting the maximum pressure on our agents to hold the line, and I think a smart way to do enforcement is to find a way to channel that demand in a regulated fashion and then that gives our Border Patrol agents the ability to focus on the migrants we really want to keep out because they're dangerous or they're criminals or they don't really want to come to do anything productive.",
