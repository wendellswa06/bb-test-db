        "It is then and only then that the Americans can come in and play the role of effective mediator.",
        "It is no coincidence that all three breakthroughs - Egyptian-Israeli, Israeli-Palestinian, and Israeli-Jordanian - occurred as a consequence of processes about which we are not aware.",

        "If you are going to have peace in the Middle East, and you want to save the $10 billion that you give annually to Israel, you have to involve all the parties, especially Hamas.",
        "Hamas is liked by the Palestinian, not because of their terrorism.",
        "They are liked by their social program.",
        "And if America doesn't realize this, you will never, never - you know, get peace to the Middle East.",
        "Furthermore, as a Palestinian, I do not like (unintelligible) to go to all corrupt.",
        "Hamas, there is some corruption but it's way, way less.",
        "Third of all, sir, and it's oddly brief, is if you - if America does not condemn actions like the Gaza people are living in sardines.",
        "They limit every - they live like a puck in a bottle.",
        "How can America justify its sense and be the sole broker in the Middle East for the peace process there?",
        "Well, there's a lot in there, but Aaron David Miller, do you have any…",
        "Well, first of all, we don't give $10 billion to the Israelis every year.",
        "But the caller has identified a very important point, and that is this that it is virtually impossible to try to make peace with a divided Palestinian polity - for one practical reason: Mahmoud Abbas does not have the stature, the legitimacy or the scope of control to deliver the entire Palestinian constituency to an agreement.",
        "And if you are an Israeli prime minister - let's just look at the Israeli side for a minute - you are not going to make existential concessions to a Palestinian partner that doesn't control all of the guns.",
        "Whether it's the District of Columbia, the government of Sweden, the government of Egypt, a state must maintain the monopoly over the forces of violence within its society.",
        "Otherwise, it will not be respected by its neighbors or its constituents.",
        "Now, there have been other processes - and you go through a lot of diplomatic history in your book.",
        "For example, the PLO was once considered to be on the outside, unacceptable as anybody, that either the Israelis or the Americans could talk to.",
        "This was largely ended by the Oslo process, and it was a process of bringing in people regarded at that time as terrorists."

        "Exactly, but the key to Oslo is not a U.S.-PLO dialogue.",
        "The key to Oslo was that Vienna Norwegians, senior Israeli and PLO negotiators came to this reconciliation, this sense of mutual recognition on their own.",
        "And if in fact Hamas is going to be brought into the process, it will not be as a consequence of America talking to Hamas.",

        "The fact is in the wake of 9/11, one reality should have imposed itself on most Americans, and that is this: that the treat that we will face for the next generation will not come from an ascended China, it's not going to come from an economically powerful and united Europe, it's not even going to come from a former Soviet Union seeking to regain its past glory, it's going to come from a highly dysfunctional Middle East in which there is tremendous rage and humiliation, unresolved conflicts.",
