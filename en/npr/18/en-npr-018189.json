        "I heard you speak at the Cleveland Council on World Affairs many times.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "My question is what is it that we haven't done and we need to do that can really change the whole fabric of the Middle East situation?",
        "I'll take my question off - my answer off the air.",
        "Clarence, thanks very much for the call.",
        "You know, Clarence, I wish there were a magic bullet or some sort of amulet or magic elixir that we could somehow mix up that would protect our interests across the border.",
        "But the truth is there really isn't.",
        "Great powers, frankly, are never going to be loved.",
        "But they should at least be respected.",
        "And there are so many problems out there, so many problems, that first and foremost, I think we have to figure out a way to determine what makes sense for American interests, and fashion a strategy which follows that.",
        "This administration - and I worked for Collin Powell for two years, a fine man - made a decision, made a choice in the wake of 9/11 to pursue a set of policies, which has dug a very, very deep hole for the United States and has cost us deeply and broadly throughout the entire region.",
        "We've got to figure out a way, certainly in the next administration, to extricate ourselves from Iraq, to figure out a way to deal with the problem of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear proliferation, and figure out a way to have a sensible Arab-Israeli diplomacy.",
        "I wouldn't even presume right now because the truth is I don't know how we're going to do any of these things, but we have to do them, keeping two things in mind.",
        "Number one, we have to pay attention to the past.",
        "We can't simply willfully ignore history.",
        "And second, we have to look at the world, not the way we want it to be, through our ideology or through our domestic politics.",
        "We have to look at the world the way it is, and we have to do a lot more listening to the rest of the world and not as much talking.",
        "You write about - we were talking about earlier the difference between big powers and smaller powers and how sometimes the - well, often, the major powers are subject to the wins of the smaller powers or - nevertheless, Israel, in that region, is not a small power, and Egypt is certainly not a small power.",
        "And there are smaller powers in that region - Hamas, Hezbollah - who are, in fact, using the tactics of the weak against them and against people like the government in Lebanon, certainly not a strong power.",
        "It's an excellent point.",
        "And what you see is a certain measure of asymmetry.",
        "Everyday in the Middle East now, small ends up besting Gulliver.",
        "It happens with Hamas, where Qassam rockets have - will, over time, increase their range against the Middle East's most preeminent military power.",
        "It happens in Lebanon with Hezbollah, where for 38 days, Hezbollah, as a consequence of being supplied with relatively low-technology rocketry from Iran and Syria, managed to shut down the northern half of Israel.",
        "And it happens in Iraq despite the surge, where and insurgency, a determined insurgency, continues to wreak havoc, not only with the American military despite reduced casualties, but with Iraqi central authority."

        "Is there a third party other than the U.S.",
        "both the Israelis and Palestinians could agree on to mediate and be effective?",
        "I wish there were because America could then get out of the luxury of being a mediator, which is not a happy position to be in, because in the end, no one's going to plant a tree in your honor if you succeeded brokering Arab-Israeli peace.",
        "Just ask Jimmy Carter.",
        "Just ask Jimmy Carter.",
        "The reality is that until another party has a close relationship with both sides of the conflict, we become the indispensable mediator, because no one in the international system enjoys the trust and confidence of the Israelis.",
        "And when we use that special relationship wisely with firmness and with empathy, we can succeed.",

        "I think what needs to be emblazoned over the portal of every negotiating room in the world is a wonderful expression: You shall not allow the perfect to become the enemy of the good.",
        "And that's the real problem here.",
        "Neither side is yet prepared to acknowledge what the core needs and mutual requirements of the other side are.",
        "The only real precedent for that was an Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty and an Israeli-Jordanian Peace Treaty, which was a lot less complicated.",
        "Right now, you've got a problem - you've got an established state involved in a peace process with half of a national movement seeking to become a state and the other half in conflict with the Israelis.",
        "So, right now, it's dysfunctional and frankly, if I was back in government - and I'm glad I'm not - I'm not sure I'd have any real practical advice for how to proceed.",

        "Nevertheless, we're not close to being there.",
        "I think that's exactly right.",
        "And the problem is not the absence of clever, diplomatic formula invented by midlevel negotiators.",
        "The problem now is the absence of political will and the necessity of each side psychologically coming to the conclusion that to do a conflict-ending agreement, to literally end the conflict once and for all, each side is going to have to meet the needs and requirements of the other in a way that makes it possible for an agreement to endure.",
        "And right now, that's - the chances of that happening are slim to none.",
        "And indeed, the perception that a lot of people had was that we were just a (unintelligible) away from an agreement at Camp David with - in the Clinton administration.",
        "You say that's a fundamental mistake.",
        "You know, it really is.",
        "You know, there are basically three schools about Camp David: The orthodox school, which said Barak laid out the best offer ever, Palestinians should have taken it, Arafat rejected it and went to violence; the revisionists, who argue that it was everybody's fault.",
        "There's another school.",
        "I would argue it's the determinists.",
        "It's my school.",
        "There was no chance in July of 2000, zero chance, that Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat, under the auspices of Bill Clinton, could have reached a conflict and an agreement on these four core issues: Jerusalem, borders, refugees and security - no chance.",
        "Our mistake was to listen too carefully to the Israelis who wanted the summit, not to take charge of the summit and not to have a effective plan B in the event the summit failed.",
        "Aaron David Miller, do you think there's any prospect in your lifetime that this is going to be resolved?",
        "You know, Neal, the last president to have an impact on me was Jack Kennedy.",
        "I was 13 years old when he was assassinated.",

        "Kennedy described himself as an idealist without illusion.",
        "That's what we need to be.",
        "We need to be idealistic, never stop trying, but as we go through this process, we really have to do so with our eyes open."
