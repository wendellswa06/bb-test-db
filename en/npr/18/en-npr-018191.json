        "He came out of those hills to the east, and it's a pretty steep decline and probably revved it up, passed a car, ran another car off the road, and perhaps in that moment of distraction he lost his concentration, and a college student coming from the other direction turned in front of him.",

        "And in doing that, he's got my support.",
        "I think what would be a mistake is trying to leave without a deal because I think that would lead to a lot of economic dislocation and would be damaging.",
        "But the fundamental fact is he doesn't have a majority, so he has to reach out across party to try and get support for that deal if and when he brings it back from Brussels.",

        "What I try and reflect in the book is at the time, Boris Johnson had never previously argued for leaving the European Union.",
        "So I find it hard to understand why when there was a better deal on offer - albeit a deal he didn't think was good enough - why he'd suddenly start arguing for leave.",
        "But that's in the past.",
