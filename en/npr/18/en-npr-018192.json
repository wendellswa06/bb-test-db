        "OK.",
        "Let us focus on that now, if you would.",
        "You are very clear about the fact.",
        "You say very openly and actually several times that we made some big mistakes in the campaign.",
        "You said you won't deny it.",
        "What was the fundamental mistake you made?",
        "I think the biggest mistake was letting expectations about what a renegotiation of Britain's position in the European Union could achieve.",
        "I mean, I still think the things that we did achieve were worthwhile.",
        "We got Britain carved out of ever-closer union.",
        "So the other countries were going to go ahead and have more symbols of statehood, but Britain would stand aside from that.",
        "We managed to get agreement that when European Union citizens came to Britain, they could work, but they wouldn't get access to welfare for up to four years.",
        "We got protection for the pound because, you know, a lot of Europe's financial services are in the U.K., but we're not a member of the Euro currency, and so we wanted safeguards like that.",
        "But I think what I got wrong was that I allowed people to think there were much more fundamental changes - that we could almost have a sort of pick-and-choose aspect to which European laws we obeyed and which we didn't.",
        "And this, I think, was damaging.",
        "So when my negotiation was complete, you know, it didn't fulfill some people's expectations.",
        "And that's a - it's a difficult thing in politics.",
        "You have to lead every day.",
        "You have to explain every day.",
        "You have to take people with you every day and not let people start to think things that aren't possible.",
        "I think the first thing on leaving office - you know, I do believe doing the job of being prime minister is hard enough without your immediate predecessor giving a sort of running commentary, and so I have been pretty quiet for the last few years and allowed Theresa May as much, you know, space to try and get a Brexit deal and fix these problems as possible.",
        "But I also think prime ministers and presidents and what have you should at some stage write down, you know, their sort of personal account of what they were trying to do and why and what they felt at the time and what they think now.",
        "And joining me now to talk about how it does it is Kenneth Catania.",
        "Kenneth is associate professor of biological sciences at Vanderbilt in Nashville.",
        "He's also a genius, and Ken Catania received the prestigious McArthur Foundation Fellowship.",
        "You know that's called the genius award, so he must be a certifiable genius.",
        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Catania.",
        "Thank you.",
        "It's great to be here.",
        "Let's talk about this mole.",
        "What makes this mole unique?",
        "And I know you have studied this mole.",
        "Yeah, so - of course the most unusual thing about it is the star on its face.",
        "And that's actually kind of an interesting sort of twist in the story of looking at what this animal is doing underwater, because that is part of its sense of touch.",
        "So the star itself is an extremely sensitive touch organ.",
        "And that's actually sort of what led down this path to exploring what they're doing underwater.",
        "So we had shown previously that this organ is the basis for incredibly fast discriminatory behaviors in this animal; so it's one of the fastest animals on the planet in terms of how quickly it can identify any food.",
        "And I was interested in looking at how might this be different underwater.",
        "And that's when I stumbled on this very unusual sort of added behavior that while they're underwater and they are semi-aquatic, so they live in wetlands, so they feed underwater frequently, and when I took a high-speed camera to these animals and sort of examined very close up what they were doing, I saw that they were exhaling air bubbles and then these air bubbles would spread over objects they were exploring.",
        "And then the amazing part, which was really surprising, is they were able to suck these air bubbles back into their nostrils.",
        "Wow, what a talent."

        "Yeah.",
        "So they spread the bubbles and they could - that must take them just - because bubbles are always moving, they must - the recognition must have to happen in just a split second.",
        "Yeah, it's very quick, and I think the fact that the bubbles are pretty small makes it easier for them to do this.",
        "There's some really nice videos that go along with the paper on the Nature Web site, and it basically - the bubbles sort of stays attached to the nostril and spreads out over the object and then gets pulled back in.",
        "And one of the things that is a very logical, general conclusion about mammals, semi-aquatic mammals or aquatic mammals, is that you can't smell underwater, because you need to have an air source to carry odorants to the olfactory epithelium.",
        "And so this was a surprising possibility here, and so I explored this by basically laying scent trails in two different directions and allowing them all to go down for food reward on the trail that had the scent trail.",
        "Now, the thing that complicated this was that had to control for touch with the star.",
        "And so by laying a plexi or a stainless steel grid in-between the scent trail, the animals were actually able to sort of sniff through that grid, so they'd expire an air bubble through the grid and then suck it back up, and using that behavior sort of go down the scent trail.",
        "Wow.",
        "Wow.",
        "Talking about smell this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "Talking with Ken Catania.",
        "So the bubble would go through the mesh?",
        "I'm saying sort of - because you separated them and then they'd suck it right back out again.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that basically eliminated the possibility that the touch organ, the star, was being used.",
        "And one of the things that is kind of interesting about this is, you know, having proposed that this is going on, I'm sort of showing a very weird unusual behavior in a very weird unusual animal.",
        "So that sort of immediately raises the question of what does this mean more generally?",
        "Is this just a quirk of this animal, which coincidentally happens to have this star on its face so its nose is already very unusual?",
        "Or is this something that other species could do?",
        "So to test this, I was able to get several water shrews.",
        "I caught a few and I had a few sent down from a researcher in Canada.",
        "And they examined the same kind of behaviors with them and they do the same thing, so they expire air bubbles onto objects and then suck these back up and they also are able to follow these scent trails very accurately.",
        "Wow.",
        "No, not being one of these animals, I'm trying to figure out how you stop from getting water up your nose.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Well, it seems like the behavior part is probably something that's - so one of the things about mammal smells, small mammal smell in general, so if you - for us, you know, when you think about sniffing, you think about probably inhaling multiple times, sort of...",
        "Right."

        "...as you go.",
        "Well, most small mammals expire air and then re-inspire air as a normal part of their sniffing behavior on land.",
        "So what these animals are doing is basically taking that same - what you might call a sniff cycle, and bringing it underwater, so that now they're expiring these air bubbles and re-inhaling them.",
        "And the thing that's really interesting about it now is we can actually see it happen.",
        "But normally, if you're looking - if you're studying olfaction in a mammal, you're never going to really see the sniff, of course, in air, so by doing this underwater, the whole process is now visible.",
        "Now, when you see a dog smell like a - (sniffing) - very fast in and out, that's what - are they doing the same thing underwater or is it a slower process?",
        "Well, they underwater would not do this, so of course I haven't looked at dogs and - but I have looked at some other terrestrial small mammals and, for example, some other shrews, and as you might predict, if you're not adapted for life underwater at some point or semi-aquatic, that this is a behavior that you really don't have.",
        "So it looks like it's most likely semi-aquatic mammals.",
        "Though having only looked at those two, who knows what other species maybe able to that.",
        "Is it to find food underwater or is it a mate?",
        "Why are they doing this underwater?",
        "It seems very much to be related to finding food, so most of the sort of the context that you see it in is when they are searching for food and foraging, and then the air bubble actually spreads over the food item.",
        "Though they are sort of doing it all the time as they're swimming around, but pretty much the purpose of them entering the water in the first place is generally to forage for prey items - insects, insect larva and things that they are looking to eat.",
        "Well, thank you.",
        "At least I can compete on random drawing.",
        "That would be pretty hard.",
        "So these guys, the star-nosed moles and the water shrews are both pretty rare animals.",
        "They're very seldom seen.",
        "So although there's fairly large populations in wetlands in North America, I have never seen one free swimming or moving around in its environment.",
        "We collect them in little folding live animal traps and bring them into the lab and study them.",

        "Thanks.",
        "Oh, that's fantastic.",
        "That's the second diver that I've heard from, and it's really great to hear those stories, because of course one of the questions is what is the physical process in sort of the chemical sense that allows this animal to smell underwater.",
        "And one thing to think about is that normal olfaction, when you inhale odorants, those odorants are being carried in air but then they diffuse into the aqueous layer of the mucous that's covering our olfactory epithelium.",
        "So sort of normal smelling is odorants going from air and diffusing into a liquid medium in order for us to smell them.",
        "And so what I'm suggesting these animals are doing is simply having another step where the odorants are going from water to air and then back into the aqueous medium of the olfactory layer there.",
        "And so my first example that I would used for people that sort of thought, well, this seems hard to imagine is the same thing happens when you bring in a cup of coffee in the morning.",
        "So you have odorants in aqueous layer of the coffee that then diffuse into the air and then into your nose and then back into the aqueous layer of your olfactory receptors there.",
        "And so apparently divers are experiencing a similar kind of thing, where odorants in the water are diffusing into the air and then back in, of course, into their nasal system.",
        "And so it sort of validates the chemical side of that, which is really nice to hear about."

        "But these animals keep surprising us with the way that they're able to adapt different senses in different ways.",
        "And so that's sort of one of the themes of this finding, is that, you know, this group of animals - and it turns out these moles and shrews are not rodents, they're actually insectivores, which is a group, an order of mammals, and they're often thought to be very primitive, simple animals, and yet the more that we look at these species, the more we find that they're doing incredible and very surprising things that are sort of overturning dogma about the way that sensory systems and brains are organized.",
        "So I think there's a lesson there, that you might - you always have to wonder how different animal senses are being adapted in different ways.",
