        "I mean, one of the reasons you took leadership of the Conservative Party is that you wanted to modernize it - you wanted to bring it into the modern age.",
        "That's one of the reasons that you campaigned, for example, for same-sex marriage.",
        "So it's hard for people to understand, then, how did you call it so wrong?",
        "Because it seems as if you were either way out of touch with what was going on in the ground in your country or, as some argue, that this really was about your party and not your country.",
        "And you know that many people argue this vociferously to this day.",
        "Well, I don't accept that.",
        "I mean, first of all, the modernization of the Conservative Party was important, and, you know, that continues today.",
        "Yes, I'm out of step with my party on Brexit because they're pursuing Brexit, and it's our party that wants to do that.",
        "But there's overwhelming support in the Conservative Party today for same-sex marriage, for making sure we keep our promises to the poorest in the world.",
        "The party is a transformed party in terms of its makeup, in terms of ethnic diversity, the number of women members of Parliament.",
        "So that was important.",
        "Look - on the issue of Brexit and the European Union, it wasn't something that simply obsessed the Conservative Party.",
        "Every single political party - the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens - all fought an election at some stage between 2005 and 2015 with a pledge to hold a referendum on the issue of Europe.",

        "I take it...",
        "Indeed, in the 2014 European elections, which was a whole year after I'd said we needed to have a renegotiation and a referendum, a party whose whole raison d'etre was having a referendum topped the poll - the first time that a non-traditional party had topped the poll in an election for decades.",
        "Let's talk a bit more about what some of the underlying other issues may be.",
        "I take it you feel the economic recession played a role in the rise of Brexit.",

        "You talked about compassionate conservatism.",
        "But in that sense, you sound a lot like Barack Obama in 2008.",
        "I mean, he was ridiculed for this in some quarters, but he argued that social forces are making people's lives unbearable and that they're looking for something to blame.",
        "In that sense, do you think that that is true - that it's the recession, and it is the underlying sort of economic instability that many people felt that led to it?",
        "I think it's deeper than that.",
        "I think that the 2008 economic crisis, I think, demonstrated that the people were feeling economic instability and were concerned about parts of the country and parts of the world that were being left behind by globalization.",
        "But I also think it highlighted a sense of cultural instability that in Britain, in European countries - indeed, in the United States, people felt that immigration had been very high for very many years.",
        "Politicians from the mainstream parties had talked about it, but they'd failed to put in place systems to properly deal with it and reassure people about it.",
        "And this combined sense of sort of economic and cultural insecurity, I think, have been some of the things that were behind perhaps the election of Donald Trump, perhaps part of the Brexit vote.",
        "(Unintelligible) this European Union and all the sovereignty issues involved.",
        "But if you're asking whether there are deeper forces at work, yes, I think we've seen them in our politics."

        "and the U.K.",
        "are being led by these rather elite figures leading populist revolts?",
        "What does that say?",
        "Well, I think what it says is that because of the sense of economic insecurity and cultural insecurity and because of the way the media works today, where it is possible to sort of curate your own television channel and for your supporters to only hear your own arguments and for all of us to live in echo chambers, I think it does make it easier for this sort of populist politics to fly.",
        "But I'm not one of those people who just rails against Brexit or Trump or what have you.",
        "We have to deal with the underlying causes and issues, and that is about trying to give people a greater sense of economic security - you know, higher minimum wages, cutting taxes for the lowest-paid, making sure there are training programs to give people good jobs, making sure parts of the country that get left behind get help.",

        "But I am deeply depressed by what's happening.",
        "It can be solved if we get a deal from Brussels and take it through Parliament.",
        "And look - I think, at the end of the day, we are a democracy, and the decision whether or not to belong to a supranational organization like the European Union - I think it is right that these issues fundamentally are passed back to the people from time to time and for them to be given a choice.",
        "And look - I would stand back from it all, in a way, and say, look - Britain is the sixth biggest economy in the world.",
        "It may not be my choice that we're going to leave the European Union.",
        "I think we'd be better off inside.",

        "We want to be your neighbors.",
        "We want to be your partners, but we don't want to be members, and that's the choice that we've taken.",
