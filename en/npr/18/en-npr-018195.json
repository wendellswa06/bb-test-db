        "I made a mistake of joining this EU ambassador who is a diplomat and he's also a fitness freak, and we basically tried to run about 30 miles through the jungle, some in the mountain and out in two days and I just couldn't do it.",
        "I wasn't the only one who couldn't do it, but we had a fantastic sort of introduction of the wild lands in Sudan.",
        "It's such a new country - the newest in the world.",
        "Just a year and a half old - two years coming up.",
        "So (unintelligible) placed and you go - as soon as you get off-road, which is very easy in a country with no roads, you find this incredible scenes of traditional African life, you know?",
        "Young boys are herders sort of stick-fighting and coming out of the bushes ready for wrestling, you know, with nothing on at all except oil and a shield made out of cowhide and sticks that are elaborately carved for fighting and they want to kind of show off their dances and songs.",
        "So you, right away, get into - if you can get to South Sudan, you don't have to go very far to get into this very remote and ancient Africa and that trail into the mountains goes to amazing green forest, much of the country surprisingly is green and wet.",
        "And there is an amazing waterfall as well.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The Niagara of Africa in a way or so they claim.",

        "Do you want to see virtual campaigns running parallel to the usual stump speeches and follow your candidate's campaign by global-positioning satellites?",

        "Nice to be here.",
        "And you say YouTube is just the beginning.",
        "Well yeah.",
        "YouTube, obviously, has had an enormous effect on the campaigns this year, but I think that the general trend is that politics is one or two steps, usually, behind where corporations and where technology is going.",
        "And so if we look at what's going on in the rest of the online world, we can kind of make some predictions - or some of them are sort of speculations - as to what might be happening the next four years."

        "And one of the things you speculate about is that, while we consider some of the advertising we see on television pretty nasty, it could get, well, downright nastier online.",
        "You mean that - oh yeah, you mean with the campaigns?",
        "Well, you know, one of the things is these virtual worlds like Second Life and World of Warcraft are starting to have more people using them than people who watch cable news networks, and politicians not where they want people to be, but where people actually are.",
        "And so I could imagine over the next four years, it'll be more and more important to try and get these users who are living in virtual worlds, or spending a lot of time there, exposed to the message.",
        "Mark Warner, former governor of Virginia, did have a campaign event -before he pulled out of the race - in Second Life, that virtual world.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That was - he was a little bit ahead of his time.",
        "He had this sort of avatar, a virtual version of him, walking around talking to voters.",
        "He looked better than he did on the front of New York Times Magazine, and it was, you know, I think something that we may see more of.",
        "Again, it's just because so many people are using these things.",
        "I'm not completely sure whether voters will be too excited at first, but you can imagine the possibilities.",
        "You can have very exciting rallies where you actually blow things up or, as I said, have actual battles between different campaign followers as opposed to just, you know, holding signs and chanting.",
        "And people once thought it undignified for Bill Clinton, for example, to appear on Arsenio Hall, but everybody has beaten that path to the door.",
        "And now you see John McCain appearing in a movie, which is a way to - you know, with everybody skipping the ads because they're recording the shows, you know, TV shows, or they're skipping over these advertisements - you say candidates are going to have to, you know, place their product as well as, you know, regular advertisers.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, this is a different trend.",
        "You know, regular advertisers have a crisis because people don't watch ads anymore, or decreasing numbers do.",
        "Whether it's, as you said, TiVo, or whether it's Netflix, or downloading programs on iTunes - those are all placements themselves, sounds like.",
        "Sure, yeah.",
        "You know, a lot of advertisers are more and more putting their stuff in shows.",
        "If you ever watch Home - sorry, Extreme Makeover, that show is one giant product placement, basically.",
        "And so, politicians again, tend to follow what corporate advertisers do, a couple of years behind.",
        "So one thing we may see is politicians just kind of showing up as cameo appearances in Law and Order, or The Sopranos, or Lost, or whatever show, just kind of there they are, and they'll find a way to reach the voters.",
        "Or having their campaign ad on the bus that runs past one of the characters on a show."

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And we may see that one day.",
        "I said in the thing, maybe on Lost, suddenly Sawyer is going to say you know, maybe Verizon really should get its cable franchise, and then they look around and then go on.",
        "You know, when advertisers have a lot of money, and so do political advertising campaigns -and you imagine at some point they will use that money to try and reach voters any way they can.",

        "All right.",
        "You know, I was looking at the success that Al Gore has had with his multi-media presentation - you know, to get across his points of global warming - and I thought that multi-media may be the future, you know, way to replace the stump speech, where a politician can get a lot more content out, and then the multi-media could work in any venue.",
        "It can work with him in front of an audience, it could work on the Internet, YouTube, and I'd like to see these guys maybe concentrate on that to help get, you know, more content in their messages.",
        "I think it could be very successful.",
        "Are we going to see - well, Tim Wu, that's a great idea.",
        "Obviously, that Al Gore movie, pretty good product placement if he turns out to be a candidate this year, but it started out as a PowerPoint speech.",
        "Could we see more candidates adopting that?",

        "(Laughter) It's a federal holiday.",
        "You know, I think the voter makes a really good point, which is, you know, politicians sometimes underestimate voters.",
        "And voters, as we've seen from blogging and the Internet, they sometimes want to get to the real content, you know.",
        "And some campaigns are just run on such a superficial level, if you have something like… You know, Al Gore's campaign for global warming - the thing was that it worked at a lot of different levels.",
        "As you know, it had the movie; there was the PowerPoint, you can actually see it; there was Al Gore going around - there was a lot of different levels of content.",
        "So whether you just wanted to read about the thing or whether you wanted to get into the science and try and run your own, you know, global-warming models, it was all there for you.",
        "So you know, people talk about going to different mediums.",
        "I also think there's more room to going to different depths - for people who are really geeky about this stuff and really want to understand it versus people who want to hear a one-minute version of it.",

        "John, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it.",
        "There's another aspect of this that will track politicians on voters' behalf.",
        "The politicians aren't the only ones who have access to technology, after all.",
        "Right.",
        "This is the idea of political accountability software.",
        "You know, we use software right now to track all kinds of things in our lives, whether it's our hard drives, our cars, our investments.",
        "You know, you don't pay attention day to day, but you want to see, roughly, what's going on now and then - and you want an alert if something is really going wrong.",
        "And the idea is that, you know, I think the people are going to start writing -and they already are - writing better software that really is designed to kind of just - something you really don't pay that much attention to, like your House representative or your senator and their voting record and what they're up to - but every once in a while, you can be like, why are they meeting, you know, spending 80 percent of their time meeting with this lobby or that lobby or with health care?",
        "What is going on?",
        "And just, you get a very snapshot idea.",
        "Because right now, I think our level of information, unless you're a political professional, about what your representative does day to day, is very low.",
        "And you know, they're our servants, supposedly, and you know.",
        "And just as much as you want to keep track of your dog or your hard drive, you might want to keep track of your House rep and see, you know, what are they really up to?",

        "I think there's a lot smarter ways for candidates to be spending their money.",

        "I mean to be - if you want to be optimistic, hopefully it would be used by underdog candidates.",
