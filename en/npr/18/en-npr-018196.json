        "So it's very widespread.",
        "It's about 130 to 140 people, and it ranges through many of the most senior people in the State Department - assistant secretaries, senior ambassadors - who either sent emails to Hillary's private email or sent emails that then made their way there through other folks.",
        "And what exactly are they being investigated for?",
        "When an investigator gets in touch with them and says, hey, we need to talk to you, what are they saying?",
        "So they're basically saying, we found information on Hillary Clinton's private email that we determined to be of a classified nature.",
        "In virtually all of the cases, the information's retroactively classified, which means the person thought that they were passing along something that was unclassified, and the investigators looking on the computer determined, no, this actually should have been classified; now you have to account for it 3 1/2 years later.",
        "Actually, in some cases, these emails are a decade old.",
        "OK.",
        "So for people - and I know that you've talked to them, some of the people who are being investigated - they're being told, emails that you sent that you thought were unclassified, it turns out they are classified.",
        "How are these people responding to this?",
        "You know, I think everybody - I shouldn't say everybody.",
        "A number of people feel like this is really absurd.",
        "I think they feel like it's sort of low-level harassment - essentially diplomatic stop and frisk.",
        "And so - and even the investigators, from what I'm told - and this is from the people who are being investigated, so you can take it with a slight grain of salt - will say the investigators are even sort of apologetic as they're talking through these with people, saying I'm sorry we have to do this.",
        "Wow, OK.",
        "Just a bit of background - the FBI started to investigate Hillary Clinton's emails in 2015.",
        "They didn't pursue charges.",
        "They closed the case.",
        "So why would the State Department still be investigating these emails today?",
        "So the State Department says that they have to, that this was referred to them by the FBI once the FBI was done with the criminal investigation and that they needed to dive in and figure out, you know, if people had passed along classified information and if they needed to be sanctioned for that.",
        "Essentially, in most cases, if you were found to have done this improperly that, you know, a letter could wind up in your file.",
        "But it makes it hard if you want to get back into government and get a classification, you know, to see classified material.",
        "Let me have you expand on that a little bit more.",
        "The people who are being investigated - including those who are told, you thought what you were sending was not classified, but it was - if they are found to have done something improper, what does that mean for them?",
        "Could they be criminally prosecuted or just - does it just make it harder for them to get a job?",
        "I think it could make it harder for them to get a job.",
        "The letters they're getting say, you know, the incident was found to be valid, but you're not culpable.",
        "So that goes in their file.",
        "If they didn't cooperate or the investigators didn't accept their excuse, you know, a slightly stronger letter could go in their file.",
        "But, you know, these are very senior folks - in some cases, you know, really the stars of the Democratic foreign policy firmament.",
        "And so they want to get back into government, and so the worry is that it could make it harder to get a clearance again, yeah.",
        "How did you figure it out?"

        "Yeah.",
        "It's not Victoria Falls but a long set of rapids bring the Nile down into South Sudan.",
        "It's flowing northward through this grasslands and gradually goes into regular northern Sudan or Egypt, and it's just that water that feeds this river of grass that keeps the animals moving back and forth all year following the spread and retreat of seasonal wetlands and creating this incredible tribal culture of people who have hunted for centuries and are still very isolated and somewhat traditional in their way of life.",
        "And these are not people who we would consider poor in our sense.",
        "These are people who are just on zero dollars a day, but as they have for thousands of years.",
        "Yes.",
        "The standard currency of a country, sort as a cow.",
        "Money is not in circulation from - once you get off a road.",
        "Cow's milk, it's a bank account.",
        "It can even be blood.",
        "During hard times, they may drink the blood of a cow, beautiful Watusi cows, extremely gentle.",
        "They're very proud of them.",
        "When I walked among the herders, they always wanted me to take a picture of their cow.",
        "They were interested in themselves and their beautiful clothes and their immense stature.",
        "And these guys put ashes on their faces and they have tribal scar.",
        "No, no, no. Take a picture of my cow.",
        "That's what they thought was beautiful and they have a sort of queen of the heard, who was decorated and dressed up with bells and things.",
        "So cows are status in the way you get married, and that is the only barter and way of life for them.",
        "For so long, we heard descriptions of the conflict in Sudan.",
        "Now when South Sudan was trying to separate to get it rights and we kept hearing the description of the southerners as largely Christian and Animist and boy, that seems to be a pretty simple description of what, three score tribes?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Forty-five tribes who, you know, they often have - you meet guys -everyone has a biblical name, so there's a degree of Christianity to it.",
        "There's also a traditional African base of faith.",
        "And it is completely mixed up, even as a country most tribes exist on both sides of the border between South Sudan and it's former master, Sudan.",
        "So everybody's all mixed up.",
        "There's no clarity to it.",
        "But on average, it's true.",
        "These are some of the tallest people in the world.",
        "You have tribes there like the Nuba, famous giants, great wrestlers and they tow - I'm tall, I'm 6'2\"\" and they towered over me.",
        "I get picked up by a couple of police officers and it's like I was a rag doll because they're so big and easily stand out from the Arab North from the traditional Islamic rulers coming from the North.",
        "And it's in a tough neighborhood, South Sudan.",
        "Not only Sudan to the North, but, well, you got the very troubled places of Congo right to the west.",
        "Yes.",
        "Sudan is vulnerable to everything that goes on around it, including health emergencies, epidemics of Ebola, or frankly, expected someday.",
        "Crowded refugee camps.",
        "They have problems like the poaching of animals that are often satisfying markets elsewhere.",
        "So Ivory, you know, the poaching of elephants.",
        "Horsemen, they come down from the North in Sudan and kill elephants and ride all the way back on with tusks on their horses to make that trade profitable.",
        "And Sudan pays the price for these conflicts.",
        "And when you think a strong government would be able to police all of these, of course, that is a pipedream, it seems.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The government is brand new.",
        "They are trying but, you know, there had been some signs of difficulties.",
        "The president, Salva Kiir himself, sent out a letter suggesting that there was $4 billion missing from government accounts.",
        "So he was asking his ministers to give it back.",
        "And I think that the corruption issue is still in the future, generally, because they have not - they have oil, but it's still in the ground.",
        "There's no oil flowing yet, so most of Sudan's oil was in the South.",
        "Now it belongs to South Sudan.",
        "They had to make a deal.",
        "But the only way to export it is through pipelines that run through its former masters in Sudan and not through, what, Port Sudan the future survival of South Sudan and getting that oil and developing depends on striking a deal with your worst enemy who's also an indicted war criminal."
