        "But it worked out for him.",
        "And that's one of the truths about managing.",
        "Tony La Russa is a great manager.",
        "He deserves to be in the Hall of Fame certainly.",
        "Third all-time as you say.",
        "If he came back and just managed a month or two, he would certainly pass John McGraw as the second winningest manager of all time.",
        "And a decade or two and he might get to Connie Mack.",
        "That's right.",
        "And that - so that's quite a bit to chew off.",
        "But managing in baseball has - of all the major sports, a baseball manager has less impact in the team's overall wins and losses than a football coach or a basketball coach - certainly at the college level, probably at the pro level - and maybe it's equivalent of a hockey coach.",
        "Managers make big moves that we all look at late in games and they decide which relief pitchers to bring in or if to bring in a relief pitcher.",
        "And with Tony La Russa, the answer was almost always yes.",
        "Bring the hook.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But, you know, experts who've studied it - and this is a harder thing to do than to figure out how important a player is - say that managers, a great manager over an average manager over the course of a season might be responsible for one or two extra wins.",
        "But there is that ineffable thing and it's not just myth, I think, that a good manager sets a tone and you want to play for a good manager.",
        "And Tony La Russa also had those qualities of a good manager.",
        "He also innovated - as you suggest, he was always quick with the hook, but with a purpose, he changed the role of relief pitchers late in ball games.",
        "If games are running longer than they used to, you can blame, in part, Tony La Russa.",
        "It is among the reasons.",
        "Although I do think if you just made those batters get out of the - get in to batter's box and stop adjusting the equipment, it would more than make up for Tony La Russa's innovations, which actually have something to do with the outcome of the game.",
        "The LOOGYs, which I'm sure you know, but maybe not everyone does, stands for the lefty one-out guy, so L-O-O-G.",
        "There are many LOOGYs in baseball, you know, a very extreme specialist who's get - who's called in to just pitch to one batter and get him out.",
        "That's not a Tony La Russa innovation, but he certainly popularized the LOOGY.",
        "There are, you know, dozens of players who owe their entire livelihoods to Tony La Russa.",
        "He - this last World Series saw more pitching changes than had ever been seen in a World Series, and he set that record well before there was even a Game 7.",
        "So La Russa was a tinkerer with the bullpen.",
        "He was a very active manager.",
        "He would always make a decision instead of not making a decision, and sometimes not making a decision is the right thing.",
        "So you always notice Tony La Russa managing but still, he was much more successful than not.",
        "Back in the Oakland A's days though, didn't he have a clear role in defining the closer with Dennis Eckersley?",
        "Right.",
        "Now he had a great pitcher in Eckersley who used to be starter, but he said, we're going to go to you and not only because you're the best pitcher for one or two innings but because you have the mental comportment to close out the games.",
        "And not withstanding Kirk Gibson's very dramatic homerun even though it came in Game 1 of that World Series, that was a turning point, and Gibson got that homerun off of Eckersley.",
        "Eckersley was the dominant closer in the game."

        "Rollie Fingers, others had closed out games and been - and served in that role, but it was really Eckersley who was going to be this ninth inning slam-the-door guy.",
        "Now you forget that someone even thought of that.",
        "It just seems like, oh, that's the way baseball goes, like four balls and three strikes.",
        "But that's not the case and La Russa had a lot to do with that.",
        "We're talking with NPR correspondent Mike Pesca, just back from covering the World Series.",
        "If you've been in a cave somewhere, it was the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games over the Texas Rangers, and Game 6 was a classic for the ages as the Cardinals twice came back, once in the ninth inning down to their last strike, two runs behind.",
        "Then again, in the 10th down to their last strike, two runs behind, tied it up both times and won it in the 11th off the bat of the eventual MVP.",
