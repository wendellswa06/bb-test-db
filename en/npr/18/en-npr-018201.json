        "And, Mike Pesca, as you look at Tony La Russa's - the game before that, he makes a call to the bullpen to tell them to get a pitcher up, and it turns out, for some reason, they get up the wrong pitcher.",
        "He goes out to the mound and brings in the guy they've had warming up - the wrong guy - and has him do what is unheard of in baseball, issue an intentional walk, four pitches outside of the strike zone, removes him to get the next pitcher who's the wrong pitcher again.",
        "Right.",
        "Now, we talked about specialists, but the intentional walk relief guy specialist has not been invented.",
        "That was a mistake.",
        "So Tony La Russa's explanation for this was the crowd in Texas was so loud, I said get up.",
        "Get up, Motte, and they heard Lynn.",
        "They heard the guy who we're talking about, Lance Lynn, who issued that intentional walk.",
        "It was just a miscommunication.",
        "Lynn was not supposed to pitch that game.",
        "I guess Tony La Russa is such an acclaimed figure, or at least he rules with an iron fist that no one said, Tony, Lynn?",
        "That doesn't make sense.",
        "We already talked about Lynn not pitching today.",
        "Not available today.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I actually went out after that press conference where people were scratching their heads and, really, it was quite a press conference because the reporters were just asking, wait, wait, wait.",
        "You got to go over this again, Tony.",
        "You called and asked for a pitcher, and you got the wrong one.",
        "And then you asked for him again, and you still got the wrong one.",
        "He went through it.",
        "And I went out to the bullpen and I examined the phone.",
        "I thought maybe I could find some technological thing wrong.",
        "It was actually a solid phone, like the kind they used to have all over the public streets, nice, silver job.",
        "I think it's a Protech(ph) 7000.",
        "I kind of cross-referenced it on different phone models on the Internet.",
        "But La Russa - OK.",
        "So here's maybe an indication of why La Russa retired.",
        "He out-managed Ron Washington, the Rangers manager in that World Series.",
        "He mostly did the right thing.",
        "But in that moment, maybe Tony La Russa of '89 or Tony La Russa of 1999 would've been hopping mad.",
        "You know, he's an intense guy.",
        "But in the press conference afterwards, someone said, you know, is there anything you could do to make communication better, and he said, I don't know.",
        "Maybe smoke signals.",
        "I mean, it was a little bit like he had put his foot off the gas pedal a little bit.",
        "His personality had changed.",
        "Not that you can't manage that way, not that it's a flawed way to manage.",
        "It just struck people who have been covering Tony La Russa as not very La Russa-like to be something other than hopping mad.",
        "And on ESPN, I even saw a couple of the commentators saying, how could La Russa joke about that?",
        "This is a very serious mistake.",
        "You would - if you followed La Russa, you'd never think anyone would ever criticize him for being anything less than the utmost in seriousness.",
        "So, you know, people are saying it was kind of unexpected even though La Russa is 67, was unexpected that he would retire.",
        "But his attitude did seem slightly different this year in this postseason as compared to postseasons past, and he's such a great manager.",
        "He's usually in this postseason.",
        "And his final contribution may be that next year we'll have a - text messages will become the preferred method of summoning relief pitchers rather than the old fashion phone.",
        "Maybe baseball could get an underwriting arrangement with, I don't know, Motorola or Nokia or iPhone, whomever.",
        "It has been suggested that he was angling for that endorsement.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, if Taco Bell gets your order right and they post it in the back so the guys in the back know that you ordered a chalupa upfront, I could think a major league baseball team might want to imitate that technology.",
        "And is an era passing here?",
        "You've - you see Tony La Russa.",
        "Just a year and a bit ago, Joe Torre finally leaving the manager's bench.",
        "There's a generation of players - managers who are leaving the game.",
        "That's true.",
        "An innovation - and this is the thing about Tony La Russa.",
        "He was a lawyer and he used computers and he was innovative, and the old guard didn't like him.",
        "And the manager of the Brewers didn't even let - when they had the All-Star game, didn't even let him be a coach, which is a ceremonial thing when he was a young guy managing the White Sox.",
        "So he was an upstart.",
        "And now he's kind of seen as old guard and a little cranky, but he's still such an innovator and he was still always willing to thwart convention.",
        "So I think a lot of the younger managers are very willing to thwart convention."

        "You know, Jack McKeon was managing this year.",

        "Well, they're thinking that - not Dave Duncan, who is his pitching coach, but perhaps some of other members of his staff and, of course, there are high profile managers out there.",
        "Who knows?",
        "Maybe he could get Joe Torre, who is a lifelong St. Louis - or not a lifelong, but played for the St. Louis Cardinals and, yeah, managed there.",
        "But, you know, I think that the biggest impact on the Hot Stove League, well, people will say - and I think rightly so - that this at least diminishes ever so slightly the Cardinals' chance of resigning Albert Pujols who, for years, was the best slugger in baseball and is now still one of the best.",
        "He seems to have a real great working relationship with La Russa, and so that's maybe one less reason for Pujols to come back, although they are so intertwined.",
