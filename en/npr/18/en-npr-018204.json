        "Completely.",
        "Now, this was something that was seemingly less present in the review.",
        "A lot of attention focused on the safe havens, not so much on the Afghan governance question, especially in light of all the drama that's been surrounding the relationship between President Hamid Karzai and the U.S.",
        "government in recent months.",
        "And this is a crucial problem.",
        "Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, again, said today that governance is crucial.",
        "You can fight until the cows come home.",
        "If there's no one behind your shoulder to govern when you're gone, it doesn't make a difference.",
        "And so the problem right now is convincing Afghans that they need to step up and take these positions as bureaucrats in the civil society, in the Afghan government.",
        "You go out into some of these areas, especially in the south, Neal, and there's oftentimes no presence of the Afghan government there or maybe one district representative.",
        "The challenge for that one person is to convince all those villagers that he alone is a good alternative to the Taliban.",
        "That's very difficult to do.",
        "So, the effort to build Afghan capacity is crucial, and that's something that there's been a little bit of a stalemate on.",
        "It goes beyond that.",
        "You got the situation in Kandahar, where the president's half brother, Walid(ph) Karzai, is the government representative there.",
        "He's also on the CIA payroll, and is believed to be involved in serious corruption and involved in the drugs trade as well.",
        "Ahmed Wali Karzai, exactly President Karzai's brother.",
        "And, you know, I was down in Kandahar just about six weeks ago, talking with Afghans there who are very skittish about speaking publicly about Ahmed Wali Karzai's ties to the CIA, his ties to drug-trafficking networks.",
        "But privately, they will discuss the fact that they don't have faith in their own government in Kandahar, because behind the scenes, it's really the president's brother who's pulling all the strings.",
        "So that speaks to the larger problem of getting Afghans to buy into their own fragile democracy.",
        "If they don't believe that there's a functioning democracy there, then it's not really worth the paper it's written on.",
        "And corruption is a big problem.",
        "The president said today, we think we have the right strategy.",
        "Finally, we have the strategy right in Afghanistan.",
        "Yes, these are gains, fragile but reversible, but gains.",
        "The strategy is counterinsurgency, in other words, we clear and hold.",
        "Then you build up those government functions behind the soldiers and matters progress.",
        "Nevertheless, is the United States - does this strategy call for the United States and its allies to sustain pressure on the Taliban through the winter season, when they are trying to rest and recuperate through, well, perhaps what they're not talking about: drone attacks and CIA attacks across the border in Pakistan.",
        "Talk about one other announcement this week.",
        "There's also the precise measurement of something else.",
        "Well, you know what, we've seen - and our reporting bears this out - this winter is going to be different.",
        "This winter, commanders, U.S.",
        "commanders along the eastern boarder, the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, say they're expecting a 15 to 20 percent uptick in violence.",
        "So this is not going to be another winter of hibernation.",
        "They're expecting the Taliban to be strong and forceful over this winter season.",
        "And the U.S.",
        "is really taking the opportunity to take the fight to them using their language.",
        "They understand that because the gains are so fragile that they really have to be aggressive about holding them.",
        "And that will - that means employing a lot of different tactics, not just protecting the population centers, which is crucial in the counterinsurgency strategy, but also a more refined counter-terrorism approach, which is - which means going after insurgents where they are, special forces raids, which have taken out several key insurgent leaders over the past few months.",
        "So it's a combination of both strategies, and they expect to use both of these over the winter."

        "Which is very complicated, because so much of this is about, as we've talked about, how the Afghans perceive what's happening.",
