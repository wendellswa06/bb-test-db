        "In an asymptomatic man, we're talking about a blood test called a prostate-specific antigen and a digital rectal examination, where a finger is placed up the rectum to feel the prostate.",
        "And how often should that happen and what age should it happen?",
        "Well, I'm not sure it should happen.",
        "What should happen is a man needs to be informed and needs to make a decision as to whether he wants to get it because keep in mind, all the major organizations, be it the American Cancer Society or the American Urologic Association or others, say that there are some known harms associated with prostate cancer screening.",
        "There can be overtreatment, as well as alarming men necessarily.",
        "So there are some harms associated with this, and the benefits have not been truly proven scientifically, although the benefits may exist.",
        "Mark Scholz, the subtitle of your book is \"\"No More Unnecessary Biopsies, Radical Treatment or Loss of Sexual Potency.\"\" Your book is very much against the established methods of screening, mass screening for cancer and biopsies and standard treatment, which is the total removal of the prostate.",
        "What is wrong with how we screen and treat prostate cancer these days?",
        "Well, the main problem is that prostate cancer, thankfully, relative to other cancers is less dangerous, and that's good.",
        "The bad thing is that the commonly implemented treatments so often lead to a drastic hit on your quality of life, specifically loss of sexual function and also sometimes loss of urinary control - major, major problems that can really detract from quality of life.",
        "And your book says that there are alternatives to all of this, and in fact, the co-author of your book, Ralph Blum, has been living with prostate cancer for 20 years now, correct?",

        "The first food pyramid mainly emphasized cutting down on fat and loading up with carbohydrates, and there was never any good science to support that in the beginning.",
        "And since that time, there's been much more evidence that the total percentage of calories from fat or carbohydrate isn't really important.",
        "It's the type of fat and the type of carbohydrate that's important.",

        "I walked out the door.",

        "It sounds like a small number of people, 2 percent of national energy consumption.",
        "That's not a big deal.",
        "But that's about 350 million barrels of oil, by energy equivalents.",
        "That's about twice as much energy as what Switzerland consumes in a year for all purposes.",
        "So it's a big number in the end, and it might be easier to save energy there than a lot of the other options we're considering.",
        "So you mean if we just don't waste so much food, it would be better than, you know, screwing in the light bulbs and doing things like that?",
        "That's right.",
        "So we spend a lot of money switching to compact fluorescent light bulbs - and that will save energy, and that's a good thing to do.",
        "But it turns out reducing food waste might have the same kind of energy impact as that.",
        "And the amount of energy embedded in the food we throw away is more than all the energy we get from all the ethanol we produce in a year, if you think about all the corn fields and all the money we throw at corn ethanol in a year.",
