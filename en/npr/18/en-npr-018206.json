        "You know, we used to have green grocers instead of supermarkets.",
        "And every day, you'd go in and buy what you needed for dinner that night instead of once a week going and filling up the big shopping cart which, you know, goes to the back of our refrigerator.",
        "Sure.",
        "We're busy.",
        "Let's go once a week.",
        "Let's buy everything for the week.",
        "If we buy a little extra and throw it away, so be it.",
        "That's our current approach.",
        "And as long as you've got a big grocery store far away and gasoline's cheap to get there, that might be the right approach.",
        "But if you have a closer model with a smaller grocery store in your neighborhood you can walk to and you buy just the food you need for the day, it sounds inconvenient.",
        "It sounds like more effort, so a lot of people aren't excited about it.",
        "But it would probably lead to less food waste and might change our eating habits entirely.",
        "Dr.",

        "Do you have any reaction?",
        "I think that's a very important point.",
        "And that's not going to be sufficient, of course, but we need to do lots of things if we're going to add up to the kind of energy saving we really need to have.",
        "One thing that is also, I think, worth mentioning is the type of food that we eat has a huge impact on the energy that's used for food production.",
        "In particular, grain-fed beef is probably one of the biggest problems that the energy inefficiency in producing food that way is huge.",
        "And we'd be better off having less of that and more legumes, beans and nuts as a protein source.",
        "Not complete switch, but pushing our diet in that direction.",
        "We'll have both energy benefits, environmental benefits in model ways, and definitely health benefits.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Michael Webber, what about beef there?",
        "Does it - it takes a lot of energy to make it, but do people throw it away as much as they might, just leave their rotten piece of lettuce in the refrigerator?",
        "That's a great idea.",
        "I enjoyed that little article on that.",
        "And I think it's the sort of creativity that we need.",
        "Clearly, making healthy foods available is part of the solution, because part of the problem is that everywhere you look, whether you're at work or in stores or going anywhere, there's always junk food available.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It turns out that beef is very energy intensive.",
        "You're exactly right, and so is dairy and so are shrimp.",
        "Chickens and fish are a little bit better, depending on how you make them.",
        "So the meats tend to be much more energy intensive and carbon intensive than just the grains.",
        "They also are more expensive, so we tend to waste less of them actually.",
        "So the rates of waste for vegetables and fruits are about twice as high as for the beef, primarily because the fruits and vegetables rot faster, but also because they're cheaper.",
        "So we go to less effort to spare them.",
        "So the energy in beef is much, much higher than the other foods.",
        "And as a consequence, it's more expensive.",
        "We tend to waste less."

        "So that's an opportunity there.",
        "And I think the other thing is, we can be more careful about how we wrap our meats, and take care of our fruits and vegetables so they don't spoil as quickly.",
        "We can think about when we buy them and when we take them out of freezer and be more, sort of, advanced with our planning for when we're going to eat what foods and come up with a menu for the week so that we're not doing it ad hoc every day and making mistakes.",

        "And then what happens is people get nervous, the meat looks funny, and they throw it out rather than take the risk of eating bad meat.",
        "Because if you've ever eaten bad food, it's not a pleasant experience.",
