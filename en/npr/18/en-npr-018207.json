        "The options for men with newly diagnosed disease can range from simple observation up to and including surgery.",
        "But in my opinion, oftentimes the other options, if skillfully implemented, treatments like seed implantation, modern forms of radiation, are substantially less toxic than surgery and equally or even more effective, possibly, at controlling cancer."

        "So I believe that our fallback position is to start educating men about the different grades of the disease and to try and exercise some selectivity about who can be watched and who maybe more reasonably should be treated.",
        "It's true that there's no 100-percent accurate test for deciding who needs treatment and who doesn't, but there are some rough and ready rules of thumb about how high PSA is, how high grade is and things like that can be quite helpful.",
        "If I could, I'd go one step further.",
