        "Now, I can do a clinical trial where I can get women to allow a computer to decide whether their breast gets cut off in a mastectomy or whether they get radiation after a lumpectomy, but I can't get men to go into a trial to figure out if radiation is better than surgery.",
        "Part of the reason there's been a under-amount of money spent on prostate cancer is if we did those trials, it's probably $40,000 to $50,000 per enrollee.",
        "So sometimes I hear we're not spending money on prostate cancer, but the reason we're not spending money on prostate cancer research is men and their physicians won't participate in the research, not that the research is not there.",

        "Otis, want to add a little bit to that?",
        "Yeah, you know, the principle is because literally we had a study that was published in 2003.",

        "We actually have the technology to diagnose 28 percent, better than one in four men in their 60s, with prostate cancer, but we know only three percent of men who are 60 will ever die from prostate cancer.",
        "That means that the majority of the men who we diagnose with an early prostate cancer need to be watched, as opposed to need to be aggressively treated.",
