        "No, not in the same way.",
        "And the reason that I've been drawn so much to Pope Francis, and to the things that he says, is because he's trying to steer us away from these issues that just distract in a lot of ways.",
        "You know, he says we can't be obsessed with these hot-button issues of contraception or gay marriage.",
        "But in our discussion of all of these issues, which are clearly important, doctrine shouldn't just be, you know, set aside willy-nilly.",
        "I think Francis is calling us to discuss these issues from a standpoint of humility, of service, of mercy, of love.",
        "It's interesting that for non-Catholics in particular, how one individual - like the pope, the leader of the Catholic Church - can wield so much influence on an individual's faith and religion.",
        "Erin, you feel like Pope Francis is the reason that you would return to the church?",
        "Well, if we can redefine ourselves as not necessarily the stereotype that I think has permeated in the era of Pope Benedict, who seemed to want a smaller but purer church, and Pope Francis is reaching out to us and everyone else who wasn't identifying that way to say - you know, come back; you're a part of this, too.",
        "It's not a club for the few.",
        "It's for all of us.",
        "Does that make sense to you, Julian and Jeannie, that the church would not be diluted if the tent gets bigger?",
        "I don't know how to really respond to the people who only see these divisions.",
        "And again, Francis is calling all of us to really go to the heart of that message; that yes, the church needs to have its doors open to all, and we need to do that in the mindset of love and compassion and mercy.",
        "But Senator Allen is going ahead to appear with the president.",
        "Well, he is, but he's appearing with the president in a private home that is close to the press.",
        "So there won't be the actual photographs of the two men together.",
        "A lot of kids, too, in high school or college students that really, really were having a very tough time.",
        "And by them actually, like reaching out and like saying that you know this music really helped me to push on, especially like on a song like Brother Sister, which I have gotten numerous, numerous people commenting on this song, about them just pushing forward, just hanging in there.",
        "Sometimes everybody needs a little encouragement.",
        "And just that little bit is like okay, maybe I can do this.",
