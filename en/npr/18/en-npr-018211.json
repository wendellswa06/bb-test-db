        "She hopes to become the first woman Oklahoma has sent to Congress in more than eight decades.",
        "And then there's Alaska where Frank Murkowski - a former senator and the state's current governor running for reelection - finished third in a three-way Republican primary.",
        "We're joined by Washington Post political reporter Dana Milbank.",
        "Dana, third in a three-way race for the incumbent governor?",
        "What does that say?",
        "Well, I guess it beats fourth.",
        "Well, what it says is that he had been particularly unpopular there in part because he had appointed his daughter to his old seat in the United States Senate, and a lot of people perceived that as an obvious gesture of nepotism.",
        "Now what's interesting is it hasn't hurt her, but it definitely hurt her old man."

        "No, no. I mean, it would work in a sort of a hereditary monarchy, but Alaska has given that up in recent years.",
        "So is this part of an anti-incumbent trend, or is this just Frank Murkowski made a big mistake?",
        "Well, it's some of each.",
        "There is, you know, if you look at what happened on the other side with Joe Lieberman, you look at Murkowski, and you look at polls showing Democrats - the minority party having somewhere around a 12 percentage point advantage coming up to these midterm elections.",
        "And you say, yes, there's a rather large sort of anti-incumbent feeling out there, which could be a huge problem for the Republicans.",
        "But you have to temper that with the fact that so very few seats are actually in play - so that even if there is something of a big wave, it doesn't really wipe out everybody.",
        "And the people who handicap these races say it's still likelier than not that the Republicans remain in power in both the House and the Senate.",
        "Now, we're getting to a point where they're starting to say it could go either way.",
        "But under no scenario were we picturing a major Democratic majority in the House or the Senate.",
        "Dana, Senator John McCain appeared yesterday with another incumbent fighting to stay in office: Ohio Senator Mike DeWine.",
        "And the senator kind of went through a list or a kind of the rhetoric that the Bush administration -senior leaders in the administration - have used about Iraq.",
        "He said mission accomplished.",
        "Last throws.",
        "A few dead-enders.",
        "And he went on to say I'm more familiar with those statements than anyone because it grieves me so much that we've not told the American people how tough and difficult this task would be.",
        "That's pretty sharp criticism from Senator McCain.",
        "It sure is.",
        "But watch what he's not saying, and that is that the war in Iraq is a mistake, or that we should be pulling out of there.",
        "What he's doing is very cleverly getting behind the national sentiment - sort of, three in five Americans really turning against the war.",
        "But since he's been, you know, very clearly ideologically behind the war, he's saying right.",
        "What I'm objecting to is the way the Bush administration implemented things.",
        "And there he's really got a solid backing of the American public behind him.",
        "People are split on what to do about it.",
        "Are we better off staying there or pulling out?",
        "But the people seem to be solidifying behind the view that it is become something of a debacle."

        "I think I was just very fascinated with the idea of a woman who feels she has no control over her life, over her place in the world.",
