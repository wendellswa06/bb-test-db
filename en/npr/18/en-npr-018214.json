        "So you can hear him kind of shouting to this crowd, but there was something else there that we've seen at a lot of these Santorum events - hecklers.",

        "But you heard a guy yell: Why do you want to take our freedoms away?",
        "He has been encountered by people at every stop, either heckling or asking questions about his staunch opposition to gay marriage, to same-sex marriage, and he has been very happy to step away from his economic message and engage.",
        "So there's been a lot of that for him.",
        "At this stage of the game, it's not about the delegates.",

        "The author, however, is famously prolific.",
        "Now over 80, he's just published his 43rd novel, \"\"Road Dogs.\"\" The book picks up the stories of three of Leonard's most beloved characters: Jack Foley from \"\"Out of Sight,\"\" Cundo Rey from \"\"La Brava\"\" and Dawn Navarro from \"\"Riding the Rap\"\" and follows them through the beach and valleys of loyalty and betrayal.",
        "It's a crime novel, but it's also about something else: whether or not people can change, and who will stick it out while we try, who we can count on.",
        "Elmore Leonard is with us today to talk about his writing, his characters, that snappy dialogue.",
        "And we will stipulate that many of you love and admire his books.",

        "Neal, thank you.",
        "And I was wondering if I was supposed to know what a road dog was and was delighted to discover a conversation in the book that explained it.",
        "Well, I felt I had to, because the explanation doesn't really - I mean, the words road dogs don't really describe what it means, and that is a couple of convicts, inmates who watch each others back, who, if one gets into a scrape, then the other one will get into it also to help him out.",
        "And I was - I liked the sound of the words.",
        "That's why I used it.",

        "Well, there's this scene where the Obama administration comes in, and the president sends Vice President Joe Biden out to Kabul, and he meets with Hamid Karzai in the Arg palace.",
        "And Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, says, well, you really should be putting more pressure on Pakistan.",
        "That's where the war is coming from.",

        "It has a hundred-plus nuclear bombs.",
        "Its internal security is a matter of great interest to the United States because if Pakistan fell apart and its nuclear weapons fell into the wrong hands, it could be devastating.",

        "And it just - it collapsed.",
        "It collapsed partly under the pressure of the events of 2011 when we discovered that Osama bin Laden was hiding in Pakistan and there was suspicion that maybe the Pakistanis were complicit.",
        "I have to - I can't let that go by without asking do you think Pakistan knowingly hid Bin Laden?",
        "I'm entirely prepared to believe it.",
        "I'd worked very hard to try to find positive-evidence documents or on-the-record sources.",
        "There are other credible journalists who have quoted anonymous sources saying that they believe the Pakistanis did have a cell.",
        "I didn't find those sources myself.",
        "I do think - you know, you look at all the letters that bin Laden wrote that had been declassified since the 2011 raid, and he was very interested in having his sons come join him in Abbottabad over those years.",
        "And he was paranoid that they would run into Pakistani police and get arrested.",
        "He kept writing, don't drive on these days or stay away from that person.",

        "So it suggested that he didn't have...",
        "Which suggests he didn't think he enjoyed full protection or any protection.",
        "Who knows?",
        "Yeah, but that doesn't solve the case definitively because if the Pakistanis helped him, I'm sure it was in a state of great concern that they would get caught.",
        "And so whatever contact he might have had would have said don't call us, you know, we'll call you, and don't ask us for help with your children or your wives or anything like that.",
        "That's not - we're not going to get into that kind of exposure.",
        "But anyway, it's an ambiguous picture, but I don't see positive evidence that the Pakistanis knew he was there.",
        "Let me ask you a question just to take us back to the early days of this book, you know, right after 9/11 and right after the U.S.",
        "went into Afghanistan.",
        "And this maybe loops us back to Directorate S and its role in all of this.",
        "Remind us why Pakistan is so intertwined with that effort, what their role was in the days right after 9/11.",
        "So on September 11 as the U.S.",
        "began to plan for a response, it had to confront the reality that the Taliban in Afghanistan were supported openly at that point by the Pakistani military, by ISI, by Directorate S and that this support had allowed al-Qaida to carry out the September 11 attacks, and the U.S.",
        "didn't know what was coming next.",
        "So they had to come to terms with whether Pakistan was going to support the U.S.",
        "retaliation against al-Qaida or whether it was going to be part of the enemy.",
        "As the war in Afghanistan evolves, how did Pakistan's role in all of this, with the U.S.",
        "in Afghanistan, evolve in those years after 9/11?",
        "Well, initially, Afghanistan was relatively peaceful.",
        "The Taliban were beaten.",
        "They fled into Pakistan, but they settled quietly into the refugee camps and into the city of Quetta on the Pakistan side of the border.",
        "And ISI and President Musharraf cooperated with the CIA in the first couple of years after 9/11 to arrest al-Qaida leaders in Pakistani cities.",
        "And so the sense was that we were partners.",
        "That began to change around 2005, 2006 when the Taliban started to come back.",
        "What were the factors?",
        "One was that the Bush administration was distracted by the war in Iraq and was turning security in Afghanistan over to NATO partners, and the Pakistanis thought we better plan for a post-American war now and started to think that India had too much influence and that they needed to move."
