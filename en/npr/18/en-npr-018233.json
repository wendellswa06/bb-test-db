        "But this notion that we all have things in our lives that sit there for a lot of time - whether it's your car, whether it's your driveway, whether it's a piece of electronic equipment or your clothing - and that what if we can use all the connectivity that we have through the Web, and through technology, to rent and borrow and basically find a way to make a profit off all of that?",
