        "Diane Waggoner is the associate curator of photography at Washington D.C.'s National Gallery of Art.",
        "And I joined her this past week to get a look at an exhibit down from New York's Metropolitan Museum called \"\"Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop.\"\" Photography was introduced to the world in 1839.",

        "Exactly.",
        "Well - and so what they've done is they've hand-tinted it not only to sort of give her cheeks this lovely blush and give her some color but also, they probably smoothed away a few wrinkles, you know, made her look as beautiful as she could be.",
        "This was a typical practice already from the very beginning."

        "And then, of course, we come to the advent of home photography.",
        "If you think you've seen it all on Facebook, wait for 19th century humor.",
        "With the introduction of the snapshot camera by Kodak in 1888, suddenly, photography begins to be accessible to amateurs.",
        "And, of course, people wanted to do fun things with their cameras.",
        "And one of the kind of tropes that you see coming up around that time is images of people with their own heads, images of decapitation and beheading.",
