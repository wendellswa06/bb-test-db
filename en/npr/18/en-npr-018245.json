        "And now she's telling me to vote - again.",
        "Why do you think that's so important to her?",
        "Because my dad was deported.",
        "Your dad was deported?",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "And they're fighting for him to come back legally, and since she can't vote, I guess she wants actually a president that will do something good for immigrants and stuff.",
        "Ramos isn't sure yet who she'll vote for, but Hispanic leaders hope politicians will start paying more attention to voters like her.",
        "She's part of a fast-growing demographic in North Carolina's Latino community: young adults born in the U.S.",

        "You know, some of their parents may be encouraging them to register and to be a voice for them.",

        "The recovery is still extremely fragile.",
