        "Right now, the technology to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons is big and cumbersome.",

        "We're going to see that with our satellites.",

        "So we're either going to see power lines going in, we're going to see the construction of a dedicated power plant.",
        "Or maybe it's going to even just glow, and our infrared sensors can pick it up.",
        "So Slakey is nervous about a new technology that's been developed to enrich uranium.",
        "It's intended to make fuel for nuclear power plants, but it could be used for weapons, too.",
        "This technology uses lasers to separate out the desired isotope of uranium.",
        "It has a lot of appeal, just in physics terms."
