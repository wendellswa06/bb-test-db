        "A recent study finds that a drug approved by the FDA to treat skin cancer in humans has reversed signs of Alzheimer's in mice and improvements showed up quickly.",
        "Neuroscientist Gary Landreth, one of the co-authors of the study, described that on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY last week.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)",
        "DR.",
        "GARY LANDRETH: One of the other bits in this story is that if we looked at mice, at Alzheimer's mice, with extensive plaque deposition within their brains, what we observed was that the plaques were removed.",
        "We lost about 50 percent of the plaques within 72 hours.",
        "Obviously, researchers hope that what works in mice will work safely in humans, but there have to be tests to make sure it works, and that it's not dangerous.",
        "Even so, Alzheimer's research and advocacy groups report they're getting calls from caregivers and patients desperate to try this drug.",
        "So, doctors, are you getting pressure from patients and caregivers who don't want to wait?",
        "800-989-8255.",
        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",
        "You can also join the conversation on our website.",
        "That's at npr.org.",

        "Dr.",
        "Jason Karlawish is a professor of medicine and medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, where he's also a researcher with the Alzheimer's Disease Center.",
        "He joins us by phone from his office in Philadelphia.",
        "Nice to have you back on the program.",
        "DR.",
        "JASON KARLAWISH: A pleasure to be here, Neal.",
        "Thank you.",
        "We should note this is not the first time Alzheimer's has been cured in mice, but that not all these remedies that are effective in mice prove effective in humans.",
        "That's right.",
        "That's right.",
        "We've made a lot of progress in treating Alzheimer's in mice.",
        "And though we're still striving to make similar progress in treating it in humans, nevertheless, these kinds of studies are very important and very essential before we go to humans.",
        "Yet, I think you could probably understand someone with Alzheimer's or somebody treating somebody with Alzheimer's saying tests in humans could take three, four, five years.",
        "I'm not going to be around to wait."

        "Yeah.",
        "I know.",
        "And that's frustrating.",
        "But there's - that the time to move from animal to human and then through the trials that involved humans does take several years.",
        "And there's just simply no way, right now, the science doesn't allow us to do it any quicker.",
        "Yet, it's a drug that's already approved for skin cancer treatments.",
        "Right.",
        "It is perfectly legal for a doctor to prescribe it, off label, for something else.",
        "Right.",
        "And that's the challenge here.",
        "And prima facie, the question, I think, a competent clinician has to sort of ask himself, herself is, you know, when a family approaches them about this drug that's available for another indication, is, well, what's the data about this drug for a different indication, which is the treatment of Alzheimer's disease?",
        "And when they look in the literature or ask their colleagues, they'll find that there's scant data at all, about how to dose it for the adequate safe treatment - effective treatment of a person with Alzheimer's disease.",
        "And essentially what's needed is research, research to figure out what is the safe dose and what is a - is it effective?",
        "I think, though, that when a family does come to you and asks about this, there's a deeper issue going on there, and a regional clinician ought to engage the family on what's motivating them to ask you about this.",
        "I mean, they understand it's risky, and probably the empathetic thing to do is to talk with them about other ways that they can channel that emotion and that willingness to take risks, like looking at the clinical trials that are available now that are going on.",
        "Because there are other drugs that are being tried.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There are several drugs in various phases of development now.",
        "And one good way to find out about those clinical trials is to reach out to the Alzheimer's Association's TrialMatch.",
        "The association has put together a wonderful Internet or 1-800 access database where you can put in your information and find out the kinds of clinical trials in your area that are available.",
        "I think that a family and a patient who hear about this drug and, unfortunately, find out that's not available and not useful for treating Alzheimer's, can instead channel that energy into looking into clinical trials that are available through Alzheimer's Association's TrialMatch.",
        "This is a skin cancer treatment.",
        "And like most cancer treatments, it is not without side effects.",
        "So those are things you have to consider too.",
        "OK, Anna.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "Of course, she's referring back to the polio vaccine and the panic of the - in the 1950s when that was still so prevalent.",
        "And I guess there are some analogies that could also be made to AIDS 10 years ago or so..."

        "These things we're very clear on.",
        "The rest of it I think at this point I'm a bit suspect of.",
        "But I think, irrespective of my view on this, I think that what I'm troubled about by this confession is that there's sort of a cloud hanging over the whole Khalid Sheikh Mohammed issue, if you will, and that is not the fact that he was captured in Pakistan and rendered to a location that we still don't know where it was, but now he's in Gitmo; I would like to have thought that he might have been sent back to the United States to stand trial in the 7th District of New York, where he could have been confronted with the evidence, and for all of us to see exactly what it is.",

        "I mean he's quoted as saying I'm not happy that 3,000 have been killed in America, and then kind of the language of war is victims.",
        "Well, I think what you're hearing now is the transition from a man who went from a person who was dedicated to the radical notion of jihad, carrying out operations, to a guy who has made a transition from that, having been captured.",
        "He's gone through the psychological process of now accepting his fate.",
        "I mean, he probably realizes that he's going to be sentenced to death at some point.",
