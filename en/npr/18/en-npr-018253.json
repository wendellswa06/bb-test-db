        "...to be as close as possible to their human counterparts, but there is still a big difference between mice and humans.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Unfortunately, you know, mouse models are just that, they're models.",
        "They are not the disease.",
        "And, for example, these mice were modeled to have amyloid plaques.",
        "They don't have the tau tangles that are also part of the Alzheimer's pathology.",
        "Nonetheless, mouse models have been very valuable to give us some guidance about what may or may not be a promising intervention in humans.",
        "But again, you know, they have their limitations, and I think this is another example of, we have to recognize both the strengths and limitations of mouse models.",
        "Their strengths are they can get us data very quickly.",
        "The limitations are, you know, they have a very different way of metabolizing amyloid than humans do.",
        "Their genetically engineered even to have - to develop amyloid in the first place.",
        "So there are substantial differences between mice, if you will, and men.",
        "And could you give us an example of a drug which appeared very promising in mice to treat Alzheimer's that did not work out so well in humans?",
        "Well, I think probably the - a good example that folks can look up on the Internet because it was, you know, it occurred during just not too long ago, were the earliest treatments that were developed or the drugs that were developed for removal of amyloid using immune modulation techniques, in other words, antibodies that would grab amyloid and take it out of the brain, and the earliest forms of those compounds were very promising in mice.",
        "I mean, they really cleaned up the amyloid, and you saw clear changes in the measures that we make of mouse cognition to show that their brains are doing better, like swimming through a water maze and whatnot to get a platform.",
        "Though extremely promising, but, you know, when deployed in humans in the early stage trials showed some real issues with toxicity, such that the earlier compounds had to be reconfigured and reworked.",
        "Now, fortunately, many years later - and it's sad to say unfortunately many years later - those compounds now are very promising, and some of them are - the reworked compounds - are in the last phase of testing.",
        "And we'll know within this calendar year whether those compounds were safe and effective in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.",
        "But sadly, of course, you know, the march of science does take time.",
        "I mean, it was somewhat decade ago that those first immune-based therapies were tried that were promising in mice, but unsuccessful in humans.",
        "We're talking with Dr. Jason Karlawish, the professor of medicine and medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, about a study of a skin cancer drug approved by the FDA to treat skin cancer that has also proved promising in the treatment of Alzheimer's, but only promising in studies with mice.",
        "And as he just pointed out, there's a long way from being effective or interesting results in mice to being safe and effective for humans.",
        "But we want to hear from doctors.",
        "Are you hearing from your patients today and in the past few weeks or so about this drug, and what do you tell them?",
        "800-989-8255.",
        "Email: talk@npr.org.",
        "We have an email question from David in St. Louis: Aren't there some skin cancer patients with Alzheimer's?",
        "Can't we find them and study them?",
        "That's a great question.",
        "David's probably had some training in epidemiology maybe.",
        "You know, one thing one could look at would be a database that has a collection of individuals with skin cancers who have received this drug or not - and not received it, and look at whether there was a change in the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or the progression of it, although it'd be hard to see that measured in the database, but yeah."

        "I mean, one of the approaches to seeing - to looking at the validity of this drug is the basic science models, obviously, which we're seeing with mice, early phase studies in humans are obviously essential, but also let's look at what data are in existing databases that might describe whether this drug and drugs like it might be beneficial for reducing the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.",
        "That would not be adequate data to then say we're ready to go to humans, but it would certainly be data to add to the case that this is a promising drug and worth studying.",

        "Anna with us from Rochester in New York.",
        "Hi.",

        "And my question is this - I could be wrong, but I'm wondering - I remember reading about the Salk vaccine that, you know, there were a lot of questions about its safety and, you know, whether it should be used and stuff.",
        "But there was also an understanding that this was an epidemic and that it needed to be dealt with.",
        "And I guess having seen the effects of Alzheimer's firsthand and knowing that it's a death sentence, this is - I think I'm pretty positive that my grandmother would have given anything in the world if there had just been just a chance that something might have worked.",
        "And I guess I'll just take your comments off the air.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Sure.",
        "...and the great pressure put on NIH and other institutions to speed up research on AIDS drugs.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think those are two good histories to look at and to try and learn from.",
        "I mean, we did do studies of the polio vaccine, though.",
        "I mean, evidence was required to show that the vaccine reduced the chances of developing polio.",
        "It was not simply prescribed without data.",
        "What's stunning and fascinating is how people stood in line to join those studies.",
        "The tremendous outpouring of national interest and enthusiasm to conquer polio using science is a model for I think just the feelings that the caller has, that there's a lot of interests and enthusiasm out there, and we need to get people into trials.",
        "And to get people into trials, we need to have the resources to do that.",
        "I mentioned earlier that the Alzheimer's Association's TrialMatch.",
        "The federal government has ClinicalTrials.gov where you can look up studies, but it's all very well to find these studies, we have to have sites that are doing these studies, and so that gets back to a very basic resource, which is money and time.",
        "You know, we need a national investment in Alzheimer's disease research that is equivalent to the kind of investments that we put into other devastating diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease where I think, over time, we have seen real progress.",
        "You mentioned though, Neal, AIDS.",
        "I think AIDS is a good example also where, initially, a devastating, utterly frightening disease, still certainly is frightening, but certainly less devastating as a result of the progress made with research courtesy of both public and private investments.",
        "What's interesting in the history of AIDS, of course, is how involved the patients were in helping to shape those clinical trials so that they gathered valid data, but at the same time also respected the rights and interests of those patients.",
        "And they made some real contributions to study design that the scientists alone were not able to make.",
        "And I think there are similar models that could be thought about with Alzheimer's disease.",

        "And if the treatment slows the progression of the disease, it'll extend the life of the people with the disease, and, therefore, the cost of that treatment.",
