        "Rachel, let's explain first, is this a departure from previous statements by the Bush administration about practices overseas?",

        "And before she boarded the plane for Europe, Secretary Rice publicly defended the practice of renditions.",
        "And throughout her trip, the secretary has made concrete statements saying the US does not condone the use of torture.",
        "But European leaders and human rights activists are saying that the US is painting one reality, but on the ground it's very different, and that they're concerned that the secretary is using language and that US officials have, in essence, sidestepped the real issues and have yet to provide concrete answers to some of the questions that have been raised.",
        "Now when Secretary Rice meets with EU and NATO foreign ministers, are these questions about rendition, about torture--are they likely to come up?",

        "Secretary Rice will face more questions from NATO ministers behind closed doors about US counterterrorism operations.",
        "And she's likely to use the opportunity to reiterate to the Europeans what has become a familiar message by now, that this is a new war, with new rules, that requires more resolute cooperation and partnership from America's allies, particularly Europe.",
        "So it will fall back on the NATO foreign ministers and, in essence, European leaders to decide if they want to continue that cooperation, at what cost and under what circumstances.",
