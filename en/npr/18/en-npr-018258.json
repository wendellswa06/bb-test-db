        "One major campaign promise that you guys were not able to fulfill was on health care.",

        "I usually don't announce what I'm going to do this far in advance.",
        "That was a disappointment.",
        "That was the single biggest disappointment of this Congress and really the only major disappointment.",
        "We were able to move on so many different fronts.",
        "In fact, if you're an American who prefers the country right of center, I've said before, and I would say again today this has been the best Congress in the time I've been in the Senate.",
        "You've acknowledged that your party has a significant gender gap.",
        "It's something you've talked about quite a bit in the past couple of days.",
        "Republicans are also behind with minorities and some other groups.",
        "What does it mean for the long-term viability of the GOP if the party increasingly appeals mostly to white men?",
        "Well, you know, we've done pretty well with Hispanics in the past.",
        "And even the current president did better than a lot of people thought he would.",
        "I think it's also important to remember that President Trump got 9 out of 10 Republican votes in 2016, not that every one of those 9 out of 10 who voted for him was thrilled with every aspect of what he was saying.",
        "I think we're in a pretty good position going into these midterm elections.",
        "I'm pretty optimistic we'll be able to hold our majority.",
        "There was a talk at one point in time about, you know, dissecting where these losses were happening for Republicans, particularly in the Hispanic community.",
        "Is it time for that to happen again?",
        "Well, I don't think there's any question that we would like to be doing better than we are with Hispanic Americans, although some of the most prominent Hispanic politicians in America happen to be Republicans.",
        "With regard to women voters, we've always had something of a gender gap.",
        "It's never been as wide as it is now.",
        "We have two great women running for the Senate this year, Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee and Martha McSally in Arizona.",
        "I think we can improve our position with women voters and with Hispanic voters for sure.",
        "With African-Americans, we haven't been able to make much headway, although I think it is noteworthy that Tim Scott is a member of our conference.",
        "And he's the - arguably the most popular politician in South Carolina.",
        "So there is hope with African-American voters as well.",
        "But I'm more optimistic about closing the gender gap and by improving our position with Hispanics.",
        "You're looking ahead.",
        "We talked just, like, 3 1/2 weeks away from this election.",
        "How many Republicans will be in the Senate next year?",
        "Now, you know I'm not going to answer that.",

        "And, Kelsey, was there anything else he just wouldn't answer?",
        "Well, yeah, I think it's important to note that this is a longer interview that we kind of had to edit down for time.",
        "And he and I talked about a lot.",
        "And one of the things he - that really struck me is that he avoided criticizing President Trump on most issues, particularly on the economy and on President Trump's comments from last night that the Fed is crazy for raising interest rates.",
        "Right.",
        "McConnell just wouldn't go there.",
        "And in that section about health care, when we heard him say it was a major failure, he didn't say it's a fight he wants to repeat.",
        "And that's not what a lot of conservatives want to hear.",
        "They wanted to hear that Republicans are going to go back if they still have control and try again to repeal the Affordable Care Act.",
        "And on that same issue, we got into an extended conversation about Republicans and protections for people with pre-existing conditions.",
        "Two Senate candidates are involved in lawsuits to weaken those protections, and he told me that Republicans are campaigning on keeping those protections and gave a contradictory response about how they can support those lawsuits but still want the protections in place.",
        "One thing that leapt out at me listening there - back to your health care point, he described a failure to pass health care overhaul is the only major disappointment.",
        "And I was thinking, I can think of others.",
        "I mean, what about comprehensive immigration reform?",
        "They wanted to get that done.",
        "It's not done.",
        "That really wasn't on his list.",
        "And, you know, I - it has been on the list for a lot of Republicans that I've talked to who had worked on immigration.",
        "Many of them said that they still hold out hope that immigration could be part of a broader conversation later in the year, potentially around spending.",
        "Speaking of spending and speaking of immigration, did you ask about the border wall, which people are talking about again - funding for Trump's border wall with Mexico?",
        "Yeah, I asked him if he thought there was going to be a shutdown fight in December over the border wall with Mexico.",
        "He says he wants to try to get funding for the wall, but he's talking about a lot less money than House Republicans.",
        "He said about - you know, money for about one year, roughly the amount that they've been spending on border security altogether.",
        "And now, that's not a big down payment or major investment that some in the House are talking about, and that sets up the possibility of an immigration conversation, of a big spending fight."
