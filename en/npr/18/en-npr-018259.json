        "So these so-called post-marketing safety studies should be conducted according to commitments that the industry makes.",

        "And one recommendation is to accept what's called conditional approval.",
        "So a drug would be approved for a limited period of time, during which safety studies would be done.",
        "If the studies were not done, the drug would be withdrawn from the market.",
