        "Well, there was a widespread assumption that in the 2004 election cycle, that in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio that one of the reasons why the black vote went up in those states for President Bush was that Karl Rove was able to very effectively use the more-conservative black churches that were connected to the faith-based funding cycle.",
        "And if they were not able to use the churches in politics, because that's illegal, then they certainly were able to use some of the ministers.",
