        "They were on his trail, only he didn't quite know about Watson and Crick.",
        "But he did know that the people in Cambridge and in London had better x-ray images than he had, and he was afraid that they will publish, you know, faster.",
        "But he wasn't afraid.",
        "I mean, you mentioned this in this book, that Pauling was not afraid of it.",
        "He said if you think you have a good idea, publish it.",
        "Don't be afraid to make a mistake.",
        "Mistakes do no harm in science, because there are lots of smart people out there who will immediately spot a mistake and correct it.",
        "You can only make a fool of yourself, and that does no harm, except to your pride.",
        "If it happens to be a good idea, however, and you don't publish it, science may suffer a loss.",
        "That's right.",
        "He told that to his post doc at the time, Jack Dunitz, who was himself a great scientist.",
        "And it's true.",
        "But it shouldn't be taken as advocacy for sloppy science or, you know, or uncareful science.",
        "I mean, what you really meant is that if you have a great idea, then, even if you have taken a certain risk in saying it out then just say it, you know, and - or publish it.",
        "And if it turns out to be a mistake, so be it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Let's move on to talk - let's talk about what everybody, I'm sure, wants to talk about, and that's Einstein.",
        "You have a chapter on Einstein titled, \"\"The Biggest Blunder.\"\" But Einstein's blunder was unusual, in that he was almost too smart, right?",
        "He was almost too smart for his own good.",
        "He came up with the right answer, and then he said no, that can't be right, and he took it back.",
        "That's right.",
        "So, Einstein, you know, came up with this fantastic theory of general relativity.",
        "But then when he tried to apply this theory to the universe as a whole, he said, but wait a second.",
        "He thought that the universe would be static, that everything, you know, just stands in place.",
        "But it was the force of gravity that was attracting everything, you know, so that this universe would have collapsed under its own weight.",
        "So, basically, he ended the term that was a repulsive force that was supposed to precisely balance gravity at all places.",
        "Now, once Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe is actually expanding, Einstein said, whoa, wait a second.",
        "If the universe is expanding, then I don't need a repulsive force.",
        "All that gravity would do, it would slow down the expansion somewhat, you know, and that's it.",
        "So he took the term out and, you know, regretted having putting it in the first place.",
        "What happened in 1998 is that we discovered that our universe is actually speeding up, the expansion is speeding up.",
        "It's accelerating.",
        "And guess what is accelerating it.",
        "It's that term, apparently, that Einstein actually took out.",
        "So his real blunder was taking the term out rather than putting it in.",
        "And now he's been quoted as saying that was the biggest blunder of his life.",
        "Were you able to find any documentation to actually prove that's what he said?",
        "So in fact, I almost convinced myself.",
        "You see, you cannot convince yourself 100 percent that somebody did not say something.",
        "But I basically convinced myself that he actually never used that term.",
        "That term came from one source and one source only, and this was the very bright scientist George Gamow.",
        "But George Gamow was also known as embellishing all his stories.",
        "And I really looked at all the documents that Einstein wrote, that Gamow wrote, the exchanges between them, the nature of the relationship between them and so on.",
        "And, in fact, the story is based just on two places where Gamow wrote this.",
        "Einstein himself never, never wrote such a thing anywhere."

        "Yeah.",
        "Einstein regretted having put the term in, but he didn't use those precise words.",

        "Yeah,.",

        "And just about a couple of years ago scientists discovered that, you know, what he suggested is actually correct.",

        "I mean, was it based on fact?",
        "He was really following - yeah, yeah.",
        "He was following, you know, the butterflies and, you know, and where - what kinds of species you find where and so on.",

        "This is the respect that he - this person got.",

        "But the blunder I describe is when he tried to calculate the age of the Earth.",

        "So in the progress of science, it is actually built in that you should change your mind.",
        "But apparently for some people, you know, after they have been right for dozens of years, it suddenly becomes difficult.",
        "They become addicted to being right, and it becomes difficult to admit that they were wrong, could be wrong in something.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "And, you know, what else happens to them is that they get to be famous, and people think they must be experts on everything.",

        "Right.",
        "Well - but in Kelvin's case, actually, he did know a lot about, you know, physics and calculate(ph) - I mean let me not, you know, diminish from what he did.",

        "And as a result they adopt something that is completely outside of mainstream because they think, a-ha, maybe I'll make yet another huge contribution.",

        "Most people - go ahead.",
        "So it's really amusing.",
        "You know, he is the person who actually coins the term Big Bang and he was the person who was most opposed to the Big Bang.",
        "He coined the term actually in a radio program, just, you know, like the one we're having now, where he said, OK, there is one theory that says that the whole universe was forming like one big bang, you know, and so on.",
        "And that term really caught.",
        "But he opposed to it.",
        "Well, people said, during that interview they intimated that he was saying it in a derogatory manner.",
        "Oh, it's a big bang, you know, that sort of thing.",
        "Right.",
        "As far as I could tell, it wasn't so much derogatory as he wanted to create a mental picture to the listeners, you know, on radio, to say, OK, it was created in one big bang and so on.",
        "And so what was his big blunder?",
        "So the big blunder was - so he came up with a theory that was - that the universe is in a steady state.",
        "Namely the universe is always the same.",
        "It always was the same and always will be the same.",
        "And - but he also knew that the universe is expanding.",
        "So for the universe to stay the same, for example, for the density of matter to not change, he had to create matter in the universe.",
        "Because as the universe was getting larger, he had to have new matter there for the density to stay the same.",
        "So this in itself was not a blunder.",
        "When he suggested this, it was a beautiful idea because, you know, we say the universe is the same everywhere and in every direction.",
        "And he wanted to add to that and that every time.",
        "So that, you know, sounded very elegant.",
        "The blunder was that after about 15 years, when evidence started accumulating that this is really not the way the universe behaves but in fact the universe does evolve and change, he stubbornly refused to accept that.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Now today we know that - not to say that he was correct, but now we know that even though this whole - the universe is out there, there is all this dark stuff.",
        "And we all know that there can be something from nothing, things can come of it, that empty space is not really empty.",
        "Was he onto something there maybe?",
        "He was on to many things, you know, even the idea of the multiverse, if you like.",
        "You know, the fact that we are just one member of an ensemble in some sense resembles a little bit this idea of, you know, of a steady state because, OK, maybe our own universe is evolving but, you know, the entire ensemble, you know, could be in some sort of a steady state."
