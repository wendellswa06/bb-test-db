        "So a bitcoin is just a - it's a form of electronic money.",
        "And with the traditional payment network like PayPal, the payments are made in dollars.",
        "But bitcoin is a completely autonomous, decentralized payment network, and so it's not based in dollars.",
        "Instead, it has its own currency just called the bitcoin.",
        "And its value floats against other currencies the same way the dollar and the euro float against each other.",
        "And over the last six years, it's gone up quite a lot.",
        "It was worth less than a dollar in 2011.",
        "And now, as you said, it's worth more than $15,000.",
        "Could you buy a pack of gum, a car, a shoe factory with bitcoin?",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "There's a number of companies now that will accept bitcoin as payment.",
        "Overstock.com is probably one of the better-known ones.",
        "And you can also pretty easily cash in bitcoins for dollars and buy things that way.",
        "But yeah, it's a pretty widely used currency on the Internet.",
        "Is there a black market?",
        "One of the things you can buy with bitcoins is illicit products, like drugs, for example.",
        "And it has proven to be a particularly attractive application for bitcoin because if you tried to set up a black market for drugs and accept credit card payments, the credit card networks would shut you down right away.",
        "But there's nobody who runs the bitcoin network, and so there's nobody the authorities can go to and say, shut down this network or reverse that payment."
