        "That was that last Broadway play by Tennessee Williams called \"\"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore.\"\" And Tallulah was kind of playing this character that was quite close to herself, a hard drinker at the end of her times, and Tab was cast in it.",
        "I think they re-clashed...",

        "So that just came nicely to the - its end, and nine seasons is quite something to be proud of.",
        "Sure.",
        "I've been - if you're in a show you hate, you're happy that it ends.",
        "But most of the time, it's quite bittersweet because maybe it's time to close.",
        "But it also - you give up that family that you've built.",
        "This one was very painful, but the Tony nomination has acknowledged all of our work, most of all my darling husband, Tony Cacciotti, who did four productions across the country - the one in D.C., in Pasadena and in West Palm Beach, Florida.",
        "So we've been on this about two years, and it actually is an acknowledgement for everyone, the playwright, the director.",
        "And we're part of Broadway history now that Valerie Harper was one of the nominees for best actress in 2010.",
        "I mean, win or lose, or - it doesn't matter because that's already part of Broadway canon, is that the right term, Neal?"

        "Yes, a few times.",
        "Some of her language was so - I thought raw, but I got around it.",

        "And she'd stop people and say, you know, this show has a lot of bad language.",
        "I see your child looks about 11 or something.",
        "We said over 12 or 13 was okay.",
