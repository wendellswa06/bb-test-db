        "But in terms of actual substantive changes, they don't feel like that's there yet, which is why they called for this citywide boycott just a couple of days after what they felt was a frustrating meeting.",

        "Thanking you - thank you for taking time to be with us.",
        "Why is this the right time to launch Huff Post science?",
        "Well, it's the right time because we seem to be, at the moment, confronting a kind of explosion of truly medieval thinking in our world, like questioning evolution, questioning global warming, questioning a lot of thought - a lot of things that we thought we could finally take for granted.",
        "And we feel that we have an opportunity to explore everything, from the big issues of our time, like the universe, to physical and chemical and other scientific discoveries, all the way down to the sense of wonder that the universe elicits, and to also end some false divisions, like we don't see that there is a division between spirituality and science."

        "And so it's really a great opportunity now to reach a wider audience and have them also use the platform to explore all these questions.",
        "Do you find it odd that science has become so politicized in our country?",
        "I do, actually, because I feel, in a way, that we in the media have partly some responsibility to play because we - instead of seeing our role as ferreting out the truth, we sometimes see our role as simply mediating a debate: on the one hand, Senator Inhofe, who thinks global warming is a hoax; on the other hand, someone discussing the dangers of global warming.",
        "And I think that has brought about a certain atmosphere where you can imagine everything being questioned.",
        "Maybe we'll have a debate as to whether the Earth is flat.",
        "And we do have a completely open debate about things while the jury is still out, but at the same time acknowledge that certain things have been settled by science.",

        "Well, it's hard to see John Bolton's comments as anything more than a pretext for North Korea's abrupt reversal this week on the upcoming nuclear summit.",
        "You know, Bolton made those comments on CBS several weeks ago back before Secretary of State Pompeo made his most recent trip to Pyongyang, before North Korea agreed to release those Americans that had been held prisoner.",
        "So if the cold feet that we're seeing from North Korea is a reaction to Bolton's comments, it's certainly a delayed reaction.",
        "And, you know, what's more, Kim Jong Un hardly needed John Bolton to remind him about what had happened to Moammar Gadhafi.",
        "He knows that history all too well, and it's one reason that many folks have been skeptical that Kim would in fact be willing to give up his nuclear weapons.",
        "Although remind us about what exactly Bolton and the president are talking about when it comes to Libya because Bolton was talking about disarmament, not necessarily what happened to Gadhafi.",

        "The president seemed to interpret the Libya model, when he was asked about that yesterday, as the overthrow of Gadhafi in 2011.",
        "That is not what John Bolton was talking about as the Libya model.",
        "He was talking about what happened eight years earlier, when Gadhafi did agree to completely abandon his nuclear program.",
        "Now to be sure, that nuclear program was far less advanced in Libya in 2003 than what we see in North Korea today.",
        "But in exchange, Libya was welcomed back into the international community.",

        "It was only a good deal later when Gadhafi threatened to massacre his own people that the U.S.",
        "and other countries then stepped in and - overthrow the Libyan leader.",
        "Now, certainly, there - one can argue that had Gadhafi not given up his nukes, he would not have been as vulnerable to that attack, and that's certainly something that's probably weighing on Kim Jong Un's mind.",
