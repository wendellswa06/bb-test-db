        "You call - you touched on it just briefly, that the intersection of science and religion is one of your passions.",
        "And you were saying, and we've had other scientists on SCIENCE FRIDAY, who say there really doesn't have to be the divide there.",
        "I can believe in my religion and still believe in science at the same time.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And there is a book which actually I have in front of me - I'm sure you know it - by Arthur Koestler called \"\"The Act of Creation,\"\" which is a beautiful accounting of many scientists' own writings about their discoveries, and how they use dreams, intuition and a lot of non-factual and scientific avenues to get to their discoveries and then, of course, have to prove everything with all the means at their disposal.",
