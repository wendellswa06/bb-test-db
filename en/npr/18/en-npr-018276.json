        "It certainly is.",
        "It sounds like everything that we're hearing, and you know, actually, I like what you said at the beginning of the program about businesses operating leaner and meaner than they have in the past, because we certainly are seeing that, and I think that was a nice comment that that caller just had about, you know, you just have to be smarter these days to, well, gosh, not just to make a profit but to survive.",
        "I was impressed by one of the articles your reporters wrote, saying about how small businesses have adapted and that indeed, some of the lessons they learned were, you know, we were, as that caller suggested, maybe, you know, ignorant in the old days, but we're never going to go back to the way we operated.",
        "We're never going to go back to the old staff levels.",
        "February, January, December.",

        "What?",
        "No, no.",
        "Yeah, well, you know, well, there's some silver lining in this really tough economic climate that we've been living through.",
        "That silver lining is that we're all learning to operate in ways that are smarter and more efficient than in the past, and we're you know, what we see a lot with business owners is that we're seeing a lot more bootstrapping, and that is essentially doing more with less.",
        "And you know, of course the best entrepreneurs have always done that, and yeah, we're seeing businesses, you know, partnering up with other businesses so they can do some cross-promotion and so that they can work together.",
        "We're also seeing entrepreneurs take advantage of opportunities.",
        "For instance, if you want to start a restaurant right now, you might look at a failed operation that maybe you could buy that.",
        "You might also, if you need equipment and machinery, you know, you could look at businesses that have gone under that are now selling that equipment and machinery at a pretty low cost.",

        "This can't possibly be a good time to start a business.",
        "But if you think about it, there are a lot of good opportunities right now, some of the ones I just mentioned, but also, yeah, like you're saying, you know, the space is available for a much lower cost than it was five years ago.",
        "So you know, that's one of the, you know, positives in an otherwise kind of not-so-great climate.",
        "Though again, you might need a loan for that, and as Janet Hildreth was saying, getting loans these days can be very tricky.",
        "Yeah, you know, it is such a struggle for business owners.",
        "At the Journal, we've started a new column called The Money Hunt, and it runs every Thursday in the paper, and we're doing this column for business owners, chiefly because we hear so much about the pain, really, you know, the struggles that business owners are facing, especially with that lack of access to credit.",

        "It's a significant challenge for policymakers.",

        "Are these the result of the same kinds of problems we saw with home mortgages where, well, predatory lending and maybe, well, over-optimistic borrowing?",
        "I think you did see a lot of over-optimistic borrowing.",
        "If you look at the expectations for how the cash flow, the rents would grow in the building when borrowers were taking out new loans, in 2006 and 2007, those expectations were fairly optimistic, even aggressive in many cases, and so that led people to borrow on what we refer to as underwriting terms that were fairly aggressive as well.",
        "It's been increasingly challenging because the people, the tenants aren't there to fill those buildings to generate the cash to make the payments.",
        "One critical difference, however, is that while in the single-family housing market, over the course of this period there was a lot of new building activity, and so we have a supply issue.",
        "When we look at commercial real estate office buildings, apartments, retail, industrial spaces, hotels we don't have the same kind of building activity over the course of the last couple of years.",
        "So less of an over-supply.",
        "Yeah, it's not as much of an over-supply issue.",
        "There's definitely some feedback and some interesting dynamics between the housing market for condo properties and apartment buildings, but apart from that, this really is about supply being constrained.",
        "In part because there were not very many buildings coming online, that allowed for prices to really ramp up in 2006 and 2007.",
        "People wanted to buy and own commercial properties, but there were only so many that were available in the market to purchase.",
        "Now, as we look at this looming foreclosure, I mean, is this is this a slight hiccup, or is this a serious case of nausea for the economy?",
        "I think what we see is that over the course of the last eight or nine quarters, default rates for commercial mortgages on bank balance sheets have been going up in a very consistent way.",

        "How does the deterioration in mortgage performance on the balance sheets of these small banks in the country impact their ability to make mortgages or to extend credit in other areas, whether it be for small businesses or for families?",
        "And that is a very real link that we need to be concerned about, and it's the primary channel through which we observe spillovers from commercial mortgage markets into the broader economy and the credit needs of small businesses in the United States."
