        "So we're seeing a lot of businesses do that as well.",
        "But I wonder, as opposed to keeping large amounts of inventory in stock, working much more toward a just-in-time, to borrow an analogy from the auto industry, just-in-time kind of process, where you order it and get it out as soon as you can.",
        "He stole the ruby from me, and if you just put me down...",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah, I think that's smart, and this actually ties into that access to credit that we were talking about before.",
        "You know, it's difficult for a lot of businesses to get those lines of credits the lines of credit that they used to have and the loans that they used to have.",
        "A lot of times businesses use lines of credit to stock up on inventory, and you know, that can you know, when you don't have that line of credit, it can be very difficult to buy your inventory.",
        "So anything you can do to reduce having to carry it for longer periods of time is smart.",
        "You know, I thought it was interesting too what the caller who was talking about commercial mortgages, what he was saying about how a lot of banks are exposed to that commercial mortgage market, and that can trickle down and hurt small businesses because small businesses are trying to get money from banks, and if the banks are exposed to the commercial mortgages, then that's going to be an even tougher climate, which is kind of hard to imagine, but perhaps an even tougher climate for small businesses."
