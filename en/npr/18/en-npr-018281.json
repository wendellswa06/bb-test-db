        "What is it?",
        "Exactly.",
        "The long-term pitfall is that even as promotional messages attract some buyers, they also annoy other people.",
        "In fact, they might annoy many more people than those who act on the message to buy something.",
        "Wang and her colleagues find that posts increase sales by 5 percent.",
        "So this is a visible benefit the company sees in the short term, but it also increases the likelihood that people unfollow the company by 300 percent.",
        "Over the long term, the researchers find that social media promotional messages actually might decrease sales.",
        "For some consumers, those postings could be very annoying and interactive.",
        "However, we're not saying that firms should not post on social media.",
        "Instead, we suggest firms to be more strategic and they should consider who to target, when to post and what to post."
