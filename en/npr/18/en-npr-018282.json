        "The book's author, Michael Wolff, spoke with my colleague Kelly McEvers on Friday.",
        "And she asked him about allegations from the White House and several people quoted in the book that their quotations were mischaracterized or fabricated, and this is what he said.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "When you write a book like this - and I wrote this over a long period time and spoke to people over a long period of time - people regret what they said to me, what they say to any reporter who they relax with and they forget who they're talking to.",
        "And I have sympathy for that.",
        "And I think the natural response is to say, oh, my God, I didn't say it.",
        "But I will tell you, they said it.",
        "So, Mr. Bossie, here's the elephant in the room here.",
        "(Laughter.)",
        "This president and the people who defend him have a history of making exaggerated or false statements.",
        "You know, he had the largest inauguration audience ever - that's not true.",
        "That Muslims celebrated in New Jersey on 9/11 - that's not true.",
        "That Hillary Clinton started the birther movement - that's not true.",
        "So the question is, who has the moral authority here when you have a candidate and people who defend him who have a history of making exaggerated or false statements?",
        "Yeah, look.",
        "I can - I'm going to speak to this book.",
        "Michael Wolff is a fabricator extraordinaire.",
        "He's lying in this book.",
        "And I'm a guy who would rather ignore the book.",
        "That's how my style is - to ignore the book and hope it goes away.",
        "But that's not the outcome.",
        "And Michael Wolff did this exactly on cue to sell books.",
        "He took the most salacious, outrageous lies.",
        "Whether people in the White House or outside the White House or in the campaign or transition spoke to him or not, I don't know.",
        "But I could tell you, I wrote a book on the campaign and on the transition in the beginning of the White House called \"\"Let Trump Be Trump.\"\" Our book has been out for one month.",
        "No one has questioned the veracity of the book.",
        "So today, Mr. Bannon issued a statement expressing regret about some of the statements that - in the book.",
        "Now you said in your op-ed that you were very disappointed with him.",
        "You said it more strongly than I am.",
        "Does that statement by Mr. Bannon do anything to assuage your anxiety?",
        "Yes, what I said was Steve needed to clear the air.",
        "He needed to make a statement because, you know, I think he was overrun.",
        "And so when you're being overrun like that, I know there's a tendency to not say anything and hope it blows over.",
        "But in this case, he had to say something.",
        "I'm very pleased with his statement, and I think he needs to continue that by showing that he is a supporter of this president and a supporter of the agenda, which no one questioned.",
        "Before we let you go, Mr. Bossie, you just made the point that, you know, your preference as a seasoned campaign person would have been to ignore this and let it go away and be about your business.",
        "There are those who say that the president's furious response - calling names, et cetera - proves the author's point."

        "And this deceitful author is somebody who put forward this diatribe, and this president has called him out on it.",
