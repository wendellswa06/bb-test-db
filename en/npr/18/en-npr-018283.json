        "Saper says the findings fit with what a few prior studies have found.",
        "And what's significant about this study is that the participants were not the Lululemon set.",
        "About 80 percent of them live on low incomes.",
        "Some don't have as much access to health care or time to exercise.",
        "Now, since this study shows yoga can be as effective as physical therapy, Saper says...",
        "Maybe yoga should be considered as a potential therapy that could be more widely disseminated and covered.",
        "At the end of the study, the researchers gave out yoga mats and guidebooks and encouraged participants to keep up the practice at home.",

        "And, Alistair, what security arrangements are in place for these lawyers now?",
        "Well, in terms of security that is actually in place, they seem to be largely using their own means to try and protect themselves.",
        "They--actually, quite a number of them have retreated to towns around Baghdad where--their own hometowns where they feel safer amongst mostly Sunni Arabs.",
        "So it's not clear that there is a specific state-supplied protection for them at the moment.",
        "The government is saying that they have been refusing police protection and the defense has been explaining one or two reasons why that may be.",
        "And why are they refusing Iraqi police protection?",
        "Well, the main concern they seem to have is that they feel caught up in this sectarian violence that is prevalent here at the moment.",
        "They point in particular to the killing of the first defense lawyer, who was killed the day after the trial was shown on TV.",
        "He was abducted from this office in Baghdad and killed shortly afterwards.",

        "Now we can't verify that.",
        "It's not entirely clear precisely what happened.",
        "But the defense team are clearly using that as a reason why they don't trust the police and the government services that are being offered to them.",
        "Well, what about using American forces?",
        "I think that the response would be somewhat similar.",
        "I think there's a sense in which the defense team would not feel comfortable.",
        "So what's left for them?",
        "What kinds of security measures are they asking for?",
        "There is clearly a fair amount of--well, I might almost say gamesmanship going on around us, but the ultimate goal of the defense is for this trial to be in some way radically altered, it not abandoned altogether, to be taken abroad, to be put into some kind of international context, effectively taken out of the control of the Iraqi authorities and the US authorities here in Baghdad.",
        "There is perhaps on their part a deliberate vagueness as to precisely what measures, certainly in their public statements, would satisfy them in order to overcome the problem.",
        "One could argue that this kind of stalemate is, to some extent, desirable to them, in the sense that it does cast some doubt over the whole conduct of the trial."
