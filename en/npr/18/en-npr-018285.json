        "Later that summer, Sawyer's lawyers were able to move his case to family court, which would keep it confidential and provide more treatment options.",

        "There is still a chasm in the case law in Vermont.",
        "There's got to be a place where law enforcement should be able to act to stop a horrific crime from occurring that's a lot sooner on this continuum than when someone actually shows up to commit the act.",
        "But at the very bottom of the Vermont Supreme Court's decision, the judges state that they only interpret the laws as they're written.",
        "It's up to lawmakers, the justices write, to change Vermont's attempt laws.",

        "She says even with those statutes, it's difficult to know when something is a real threat.",

        "So that's a very exciting possibility, but of course it's also very nervous-making because if you put up a constitution for a yes or no vote, it might just go down.",

        "has been addressed recently with the possibility that come the new year there might be some amendments to this constitution.",

        "And what those politicians wanted were some substantive changes.",

        "But of course once the constitution is ratified, there's no need to guarantee that that option will actually be exercised.",
        "So whether that's a strong guarantee for Sunnis or not is something that remains to be seen, and I think the voters will decide.",
        "So there was a bombing today of the Sunni political headquarters, and I'm wondering how that might affect the turnout.",
        "The key thing to realize is that there isn't a single Sunni political leadership.",
        "It's very divided.",
        "And those within the Sunni community, both foreigners and domestically Iraqis, who want to block the elections from going forward, who want to block a political solution to the problems in Iraq, are going to do everything they can to try to stop those supporters of the constitution from getting a foothold.",
        "And that's what that bombing means.",
        "It means that those who are focused on blocking political progress want to stand in the way of those who would like to promote it.",
        "So I think it means that ordinary Sunnis who are thinking they might vote for the constitution may think twice about it.",
        "They may be worried about their safety and security.",
        "The guarantee, of course, should be that it's a secret ballot, and when you go into the ballot you can tell everyone on the outside that you're going in to vote no on the constitution.",
        "Maybe they'll let you in.",
        "But once you're in there you could vote yes if you really wanted to.",

        "You hold an election to find out how people did vote when they were alone inside the ballot box and pulled that lever--or, in this case, mark their X.",
        "I wonder if you can make any historical comparisons to just how revolutionary this is in terms of an entire country voting on a constitution.",
        "I mean, here in the US, in America, we certainly didn't vote on our constitution and we don't vote on amendments.",
        "We never had a national referendum.",
        "That's absolutely right.",
        "Although some state constitutions do have referendum processes.",

        "And there's some other states where it's the same sort of thing.",
        "But those are amendments just to a local document, not to something that's going to set the fate of an entire people.",

        "That's right.",

        "They can cater to demagoguery.",
        "They can force people to line up along not very nuanced political lines, lines like ethnicity or race or class.",

        "I mean, there's no question that Shia will vote overwhelmingly for this document and the Kurds will vote overwhelmingly for it.",
