        "That's the scenario.",
        "The only kind of mention I do make over the whole controversy is a line that Benny says in the first few days of the strip where he says, if I don't keep my story alive, who will?",
        "So this is kind of - we have Benny talking about his story.",

        "Right.",

        "But the outpouring of anger that you saw over this nomination, triggered by the nomination, I think signifies just how unsettled a lot of these questions are and how emotional they are for so many people, as you said, on both sides - a left that was already quite exercised, particularly women.",
