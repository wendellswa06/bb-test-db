        "Hi, Cokie.",
        "Hi, Steve.",
        "First, a president normally should stay above all that - that's going to be a foreign concept to people watching politics today.",
        "Well, of course, in the really early days, presidents didn't even campaign.",
        "It sort of gradually evolved that they got to this point.",
        "But he certainly didn't stay above it.",
        "He engaged in what was called his purge campaign against conservative Democrats, and it was pretty much a disaster for him, Steve.",
        "None of the senators he opposed lost.",
        "Only one House member did.",
        "Republicans picked up seats in both the House and Senate.",
        "So Franklin Roosevelt's foray into partisan politics had the effect of weakening him more than strengthening him as president.",
        "And I'm guessing from what you're saying, there must have been Democratic senators who he opposed who ended up back in Congress the next year.",
        "How'd that work out?",
        "Yeah, well, you can imagine.",
        "One in particular, Walter George of Georgia, a very powerful member of the Senate - FDR had gone out and campaigned against him saying let me make it clear he is and I hope always will be my personal friend.",
        "Well, George didn't see it that way.",
        "And years later, Jim Rowe, who had been Roosevelt's chief of staff, told me this wonderful story that the leadership of the Senate was meeting about some bill.",
        "And some members said, the president is his own worst enemy.",
        "And Walter George said - not as long as I'm alive, he's not.",
        "(Laughter) OK.",
        "Little lesson of history there for the current president just to think about what the history says."

        "Well, I assume what's meant here is the opposition party, meaning the Democrats.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They have two choices.",
        "They can just sit back and enjoy the disarray among their opponents, or they can take the opportunity to isolate the naysayers in the majority party and work with the rest of the majority party to actually get something done.",
        "And moderate Republicans, for instance, played that role for many, many years when the Democrats controlled Congress.",
        "But as you...",
        "Oh - so the Democrats would be divided.",
        "But that meant that the Republicans in the minority got to be the swing vote.",

        "And the question is - (reading) historically, has there been a time when a third party has ended a stand-off between the major parties?",
        "Basically, no. We don't have much by way of third parties in our history.",
        "But they have affected legislation.",
        "The Prohibition Party, which started in 1869 - took 50 years, but they got the 18th Amendment prohibiting alcohol passed in 1919.",
        "Of course, it was later repealed.",
        "In living memory, Ross Perot garnered 19 percent of the vote in 1992, running against the federal deficit.",
        "And Congress got much more interested in that issue once he got such a large vote.",
        "And in fact, when Bill Clinton won the presidency, he achieved our last budget surplus.",
        "So it can make a difference to have third parties pushing on the two major parties.",
        "A lot of interest in how to break gridlock in Washington even now.",

        "It made it much faster, much easier, much less expensive to do genome editing.",

        "Including whether to try to edit the genes in human sperm, eggs or embryos to prevent babies from being born with a long list of terrible diseases.",
