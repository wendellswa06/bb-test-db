        "I mean, one of the reasons this project is so exciting is that you raised the money through a Kickstarter which actually exceeded all expectations.",
        "Tell me, why that approach?",
        "You know, it was - I've done a couple of Kickstarter campaigns before with both of my indie films.",
        "And I always looked at it more as a way to kind of build a fan base, less so than the actual financing of it all.",
        "You know, it kind of allows you to, as a filmmaker, to kind of announce that you're doing something but in, like, a non kind of braggadocious way.",
        "And it kind of allows people who, you know, may want to be involved or kind of see the project through to help out.",
        "And so it just seemed like a - the obvious first step for us.",
        "And it ended up becoming the highest-funded Kickstarter campaign for a short film.",
        "So what is it that you think people are responding to?",
        "I have to say that, I mean, look - the little girl is absolutely adorable.",
        "The dad has locks, and he's struggling with the hair.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "It's just hard for me to describe, but the hair, for anybody who's tried to do little black girl hair, it's very accurate.",
        "It kind of has a life of its own.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But what do you think it is that people are responding to?",
        "You know, I think it's a couple of things.",
        "You know, I think representation is the biggest thing.",
        "You know, when we did this campaign two years ago, there wasn't a lot of representation in animated projects.",
        "You know, oftentimes they would cast actors of color but, you know, they'd be playing inanimate objects or animals.",
        "And, you know, it was rarely, like, actually seeing a family dynamic in animation.",
        "Obviously, there was, like, \"\"Princess And The Frog\"\" and that Rihanna movie, \"\"Home.",
        "But I just thought it'd be nice to be able to see a black family in that space because animation is one of the most wide-appealing genres.",
        "And I think it does also a lot for young people's confidence when they see themselves represented.",
        "You know, media is so powerful.",
        "And when you grow up and see magazine covers and TV shows and movies and you don't see yourself represented, but you see every other type of hairstyle represented, you know, that can really affect your self-confidence."

        "Even though the atmosphere is thin, it's substantial enough to slow the spacecraft down to 750 miles an hour.",
        "Three minutes before landing comes the parachute.",
