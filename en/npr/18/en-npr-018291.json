        "Here to explain is Marketplace's Nancy Marshall-Genzer.",
        "Nancy, today oil is trading at about 122 dollars a barrel, that's about a two month low, so why isn't that kind of decrease reflected in gas prices?",
        "Yes, it is true that gas prices do tend to rise faster then they fall, at least that's our perception.",
        "Partly that's because it takes a while for prices at the pump to catch up with what's happening on the oil markets, partly because the gas we're buying at the pump today was refined from oil that was shipped weeks ago, when oil prices were higher.",

        "Now, Hackett says that was just our perception, but other analysts do say that gas prices have tended to go up faster than they come down.",
        "They say that's because, when prices fall, consumers stop shopping around as much, so station owners could keep drivers happy by just knocking off a few cents a gallon.",
        "Well now, Nancy, it seems like people are shopping around a lot more than they used to for gas, so how is that affecting prices?",
        "Well.",

        "Price does count, and people respond to prices, and that's what we're seeing.",
        "You know, people have been, you know, consolidating their trips.",
        "And, also, of course, you know, such a dramatic change in the kind of vehicles that people want to buy.",
        "And Yergin says the U.S.",
        "gas market, Alex, is bigger than the entire market for oil in China, so when we consumers in the U.S.",
        "flex our muscles, it has a worldwide impact.",
        "And looking ahead, is there any sense that demand will continue to fall in the U.S.?",
        "Well, Alex, Yergin calls that the 64 billion dollar question."
