        "Well, right now the bill doesn't look popular among the American public.",
        "We have - polls from Gallup and Quinnipiac found support at just 29 percent.",
        "Is that a warning for Republicans who have to run for re-election and, for that matter, political opportunity for Democrats?",
        "It would seem to be both, especially given the heavy benefits that the bill does give to corporations and the wealthy, who indeed get most of the tax cut value, especially considering that the corporation cuts are going to be made permanent, and the individual cuts are going to phase out after several years around about 2025, which would theoretically be just after the end of President Trump's second term.",
        "So the populist shoe may be on the other partisan foot in 2018.",
        "The question is...",
        "Can you walk that way?",
        "(Laughter) I'm just trying to figure out that metaphor, Ron.",
        "But go ahead, yes.",
        "Well, I was just about to say, is that enough for the Democrats to run on?",
        "OK.",
        "So if the tax cuts are at least visible to most Americans, then we don't really expect them to storm the Capitol with torches if somebody else is getting a larger tax cut.",
        "But watch what comes next.",
        "House Speaker Paul Ryan says they're going to reform entitlements, and that translates to meaning they're going to cut back on Medicare, Medicaid, possibly go after Social Security.",
        "And that's where people drew the line on Ronald Reagan's spending cuts and George W.",
        "Bush's spending cuts.",
        "So we'll be waiting to see if it's different this time.",
        "And the Alabama Senate race - Doug Jones will be the first Democratic senator from Alabama in a generation - 25 years.",
        "He defeated Roy Moore - I think the most controversial major party candidate for senator since David Duke - after several women came forward to say that Roy Moore had sexually harassed or assaulted them as teenagers.",
        "A few days have passed since the vote.",
        "What do you make of the result?",
        "First, it was a big victory for African-American voters in Alabama.",
        "They turned out in Obama election-like numbers, and they made the difference.",
        "This election has probably been overdrawn a bit as a repudiation of Trumpism - the turning of the Trumpian tide in national politics, as you know.",
        "It probably had more to do with Moore - Roy Moore - and his unique trainload of baggage.",
        "But it's still hard not to compare it to what happened back in 2010 when Scott Brown was elected in Massachusetts, taking Teddy Kennedy's seat.",
        "And this was at about the same point in President Obama's first term.",
        "That really changed the mood on Capitol Hill.",
        "It did not stop the passage of Obamacare, but it signaled a big turnover in Congress in the next elections.",
        "And we could be heading into a correction here in the other direction under President Trump."

        "Yeah, Mozart bought a starling and he made this entry in his expense book about buying the bird and later on it turned out that the opening theme of the third movement of his \"\"Piano Concerto No. 17\"\" sounded a lot like the bird.",

        "Ray, do you have a personal favorite of classical music that's been inspired by birds?",
        "Well, it's kind of hard to pick because there are so many, but if I had to choose one I'm pretty sure it would Ralph Vaughan Williams's \"\"The Lark Ascending.\"\" Just a beautiful, sublime piece, and it captures not only kind of the sound - the beautiful sound of the skylark - but also the flight.",
