        "How did you discover your faith?",
        "Actually the missionaries - LDS missionaries found me in Nashville when I was 15 years old.",
        "They knocked to my door and sort of the rest is history from then on.",
        "What compelled you about their message?",
        "I was very - very taken by this idea of God continues to speak to people.",
        "And that the books - the Bible is not closed, but yet, remains open and God very much is involved and governs the lives of individuals.",
        "So I was very taken by that message.",
        "But my initial introduction into the faith at, you know, at 15 was not, I would say, hardly, you know, doctrinal theological.",
        "It was more social at that point.",
        "So I was looking for friends.",
        "So given that, how did your family react?",
        "Were they practicing members of any faith?",
        "And if so, did they say, hey, what's going on?",
        "You guys - you can't step away from us?",
        "Well, my grandmother, you know, was born Baptist and she used to always to say, you know, Baptist born, Baptist be when I die.",
        "Baptist buried.",
        "So she was pretty much, you know, hardcore committed to that particular faith community.",
        "So she was the only one that really offered any kind of opposition to, you know, to me in terms of my interest in the LDS Church.",
        "In fact, she actually told me, you know, to be careful because, you know, those Mormons had some, you know, had some racist ideas about black folks.",
        "She didn't know exactly what those ideas were.",
        "Well, she had heard that the Mormons were, you know, a racist organization.",
        "Well, I want to get back to that in a second, but I want to move on to talk to our other folks.",
        "Now, Robin, your story is a bit different.",
        "Tell us about how you were raised and, you know, in terms of the faith community.",
        "Right.",
        "I was raised always very Jewish, although not necessarily very religious.",
        "We celebrated holidays and everything, but we, sort of, kind of, belong to a synagogue.",
        "We lived in a ever-changing neighborhood.",
        "My family is interracial.",
        "My mother was Jewish and not black.",

        "This was in the late '50s, early '60s, and that was definitely a calling.",
        "But we're very - my parents worked very hard - took me years to realize this.",
        "To make sure that my brother and I knew we weren't the only one, we would share Passover Seders with another black Jewish family.",
        "So for us, it's actually, it was no big deal to be black and Jewish.",
        "Later, we realized maybe the rest of the world doesn't know that.",
        "By the way, just like Darron, I've got my baptism ancestors because my father was a Baptist and an atheist.",
        "My grandfather was a Baptist minister and they come from - he came from a whole line of Baptist minister.",
        "And I think I was supposed to be one, too.",
        "Well, when you say that you're father was Baptist and atheist, you're talking about in that sense, a culture, the Baptist culture still remained although, you know, theologically I guess he was an atheist.",
        "Did he ever practiced the Jewish religion then once he married…",
        "No, no.",
        "No, he didn't.",

        "He definitely had his own ideas.",

        "I grew up in a family surrounded by ministries.",
        "I'm the fifth generation clergy in my family.",
        "So going into theological education was a natural thing for me even though prior to my commitment to theological education, I had determined to make an investigative tour on my own to be sure that I was not in theological education only because of family tradition, but was in theological education because of a decision that I had made on my own.",
        "And then I discovered that we never really make decisions on our own because no decisions are ever made in a vacuum(ph).",

        "I want to ask you, you're the only person here who's taught religion specifically.",
        "We've had other people who've taught.",
        "What makes that different, teaching in a formal context rather than teaching within your family or your congregation?",
        "One of the primary things that one tries to do when teaching theological concepts and philosophical concepts in a formal context is that you are trying to help people learn how to think for themselves, how to be more critical in their investigation of textual material, and also in terms of doctrinal precepts.",
        "When a person is teaching family faith tradition, you tend to teach family faith tradition by trying to reassure people of the correctness of that tradition.",
        "But in a formal setting, you're trying to teach people to be very, very critical to raise questions that you would not normally raise around the family table.",
        "For a number of years, I taught philosophy and religion at Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia.",
        "And I would always say to my students that it is not for me to tell you what to think.",
        "It is for me to tell you how to find the resources to shape your thinking and also to shape your analysis of what you have been told to teach by both of your church and by your family context.",
        "And then in theological education on the graduate level at ITC, we have consciously engage in the process of helping people to raise critical questions about faith in part because as a clergy person, it is the people in the congregation and the people around you who are raising critical questions, those are the ones who probably have a greater investment in faith than those who are raising shallow questions.",
        "Well, that brings us as a perfect transition to Darron.",

        "That's Brigham Young, which is a Mormon-affiliated university.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And the institution, as you know, is fairly Orthodox in a way that it goes about its daily business.",
        "And so race is not routinely discussed in many classes, in many courses there unfortunately.",
        "And so, when \"\"Black and Mormon\"\" dropped, there was a lot of discussion about this book and some of the issues regarding African-Americans or these people of African descent."

        "And so I began to talk about this more openly in classes not only on the campus of Brigham Young but also at other institutions around here in Utah.",

        "Practitioners of the faith began to question my commitment to the faith.",
        "And…",
        "Well, let's just be a little specific about the issues you were raising before you tell us more about the response.",
        "Okay.",
        "You bet.",
        "Okay.",
        "What questions were you asking?",
        "Well, the questions are about, you know, often at least in terms of Mormonism, there is this belief within Mormonism that blacks had descended from Cain.",
        "And I'm sure your guests could speak to this issue because this is something that's been as common in Christianity, Judaism, as well as Islam, is this belief that blacks - the reason why we have black skin to some extent extended from God or a curse that God put on black folks.",
        "And the Mormon faith continues to persist with this particular belief regardless of the fact that there has been - there was a formal announcement 1978 that essentially enabled black men that prior before 1978, black men could not participate or hold the priesthood and that black women could not attend Mormonism's holiest places, which is the temples.",
        "But after 1978, Spencer W.",
        "Kimball essentially announced that this particular ban was no longer of much importance and that blacks could now equally participate.",
        "Well, when that happened, the theological racist folklore that underscored the ban to begin with was never really explained properly by church authorities.",
        "And so unfortunately, many of the practicing Mormons, white Mormons in particular, still believe this and this is still quite a common theme around this particular area when the question of blacks and why blacks couldn't participate in the faith comes up.",
        "So my purpose then was to sort of elucidate to my students the historical origins of this.",
        "And not just only within Mormonism but also within the larger religious context of the way in which blacks have been marginalized not only in other institutions but also in Christianity.",
        "And to expand this discussion beyond the church, well…",
        "Let me…",
        "…of course, it led into me being disciplined essentially."
