        "So how did hip-hop expand?",

        "But, you know, from the very beginning it's incorporated Afro-Caribbean, you know, Afro-Latino, Afro-diasporic oral traditions and dances and rhythms.",
        "And, you know, as hip-hop expanded, I think two things happened.",
        "One is it found itself fitting into already preexisting, you know, sort of, cultural movements.",
        "So, for instance, hip-hop goes to Brazil and you've already got a sound system culture.",
        "You've already got a style - the music called cantu faludo(ph), you know, spoken song and hip-hop just fits right in.",
        "And then you have other places such as South Korea, where, you know, I'm just thinking of this new movie called \"\"Planet B-Boy,\"\" which documents these international competitions that occur for breakers and shows the B-Boys from South Korea really dominating the competition.",
        "I think that kids there, really, were attracted to it and were transformed by hip-hop culture, and also are now beginning to transform hip-hop itself.",
        "You talk about how Public Enemy changed the game.",
        "What do you mean by that?",
        "Well, Public Enemy, you know, was really heard by a lot of different people in a lot of different places as something that was really relevant to their time.",
        "And what it represented, I think - what the message of Public Enemy represented was really specific in some respects to the, you know, sort of conditions of the 1980s.",
        "The racist kinds of violent incidents that were going on, a lot of the protests that were occurring on the campuses.",
        "But at the same time, what I think people around the world heard in it, was a generational change, a way for them to express their own voices.",
        "So you take, for instance, rappers in Kenya.",
        "A group like Kalamashaka, you know, comes out, here's Public Enemy, and all of a sudden inspired not just to imitate American rap but now to rap in Sheng, which is their own, sort of, language of Swahili and Kikuyu and English slang.",

        "So Jeff, what does \"\"Niwakati\"\" mean?",
        "Well, the song is basically about trying to express the continuation of the legacy of the Mau Mau and, sort of, that resistance to, you know, anti-authoritarian - or authoritarian forces in Kenya at that particular time.",
        "What's interesting is that now that hip-hop's become such a global commodity, you have people like MTV coming in, you have cell phone companies coming in, you have British conglomerates buying up the radio stations, and so what has been a real local scene, a very politically resistant type of scene is transforming now.",
        "And a lot of these voices like Kalamashaka are being pushed off of the radio and off of the airwaves.",

        "And so when you hear her, what she's done is she, sort of, brought together a lot of beats from, you know, her native land, as well as understood what was happening with reggae tone, with Brazilian rap and put these all together, sort of, in this global stew.",
