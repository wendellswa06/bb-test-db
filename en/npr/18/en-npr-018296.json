        "I don't know why I didn't expect, like I've always anticipated that I was going to find hip-hop because of my relationship, like, my entire life has been about hip-hop.",
        "I think, I've been overwhelmed sometimes by the magnitude of it.",
        "Let's say in the Philippines.",
        "We went to Manila, Davao and Cebu.",
        "And it was just interesting for me that these people had very little access to material things and items, but were so dedicated to rhyming and to B-Boying and to dancing.",
        "And in Dakar, as Jeff mentioned, Dakar is like - when I first shoot there it almost like going to hip-hop heaven.",
        "And most of it was in the languages I couldn't understand but it didn't matter.",
        "In Senegal, was the first time I actually cried in a cipher(ph).",

        "Yeah.",

        "Well, that group that I mentioned, Dara G., they came to L.A.",
        "and they will rhyme in French, Wolof, English…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…and probably a couple of other languages, besides there's a certain - Jeff, what do you think about the linguistic angle because, you know, there are - there's times that I've listened to Japanese hip-hop and I'm like, I totally get what the emcee is saying emotionally.",
        "I may not get every word.",
        "And what about the linguistic issues of listening to hip-hop that's not in your language or language that you speak?",
        "Well, you know, I think one is hip-hop just sort of allows people to be able to tell their own stories.",
        "And the language thing, you know, the fact that Keenan Rappers(ph) in Nairobi are rapping in Shang is really amazing type of thing.",
        "But, you know, there's always a slippage that's going on.",
        "I heard a story recently with somebody who was talking about being in another country and talking to somebody about 50 Cent.",
        "And this person saying, you know, I really feel this person because, you know, you can tell that they're very - just politically aware and they know, you know, what the real deal is and you can feel their honesty and their authenticity in their voice.",
        "And in some ways, you know, a lot of us here in the U.S.",
        "feel like a lot of commercial rap represents a lack of that.",
        "So, you know, it goes both ways.",
        "It's just there's a demand for honesty that we ask of hip-hop but it's interesting that that we're getting a lot of simulations of it these days."

        "Well, everything, I think, part of why I'm able to - like I travel extensively and have a very limited, like, recording catalogue this far, but I think why I'm able to connect to audiences is because there's a level of appreciation and there's a hunger and a desire for artistic integrity and authenticity.",
        "And one of the things that I talk to American hip-hop artist about when I speak to audiences here on panels is the importance of them recognizing their power and their ability to influence, to guide and to set trends.",
        "And I think oftentimes we here underestimate our power because we're here struggling to make it as, quote, \"\"starving artist.\"\" And we don't realize that we're not starving, that we might have, you know, a little bit of food on the table but we actually have food to eat.",
        "And there's something that we can do with that in terms of sharing what it is we had to give.",
        "Like I freestyled already on Novo(ph) with Dara G.",
        "And I've done that a couple of times and it was just like this powerful thing that occurred and I rocked in stadiums in Senegal.",
        "And where the people rise to their seats so much because there's a level of gratitude that you as a, quote, \"\"American\"\" took the time out to acknowledge their existence and their contribution to hip-hop.",
        "And so there's this global network and this global exchange and this exchange of energy, and it's one of the reasons why I still - no matter what mainstream media portrays of my culture, which is hip-hop - I still say that hip-hop is about love.",
        "Jeff and Toni, maybe Toni first on this.",
        "I have a friend who went to Kenya and everybody was like, what's up, my N, you know, it just was like having this cultural moment like why is everybody using the N-word?",
        "And it's like, oh, duh.",
        "Because that's what people put out in mainstream hip-hop.",
        "Do we need to take responsibility as Americans for what we put out there?",
        "Toni and then Jeff.",
        "I mean, we do have to take responsibility for it but I think aesthetically, we also have to understand certain words sound good in the mouth and this is not a rationale that they're using for, like the M-F word?",
        "And certain words like I've been doing freestyle workshops for about 13 years.",
        "And I realized that the M-F word and the N-word, they weren't even about disrespect or trying to appear to be hard.",
        "They were - they make excellent pause words because the amount of consonants …",
        "It's better than Uhm…",
        "Yes, and the amount of consonants inside of the word gives you - you can hit the beat with that particular word.",
        "And so, it is, you know, Malcolm X say, you know, people use these words because they lack vocabulary and what not, in which I agree and so we try to give them tools but there are no vehicles for rap lyricists and rap artists to go and develop.",
        "You can't go to Berkeley and study it.",

        "But this is the first year where this is actually happening and kids are getting an opportunity to learn from those of us who help to create the culture, but I think we have to acknowledge also how it feels in the mouth.",
        "It's a part of -and so we're able to easily rationalize the use of it and then we can educate once we acknowledge what's going on first and foremost for a lot of people.",
        "Well, Jeff, what about the larger issues of just kind of what we put out there as Americans, you know.",
