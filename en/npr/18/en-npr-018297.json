        "But I think I didn't feel equipped to write about male bisexuality.",
        "I wasn't sure how different it was.",
        "And I have to say, being on a book tour, I've been humbled, and kind of embarrassed even, by how many men will come to the readings kind of hoping that there will be something there for them and how little I have to offer.",
        "But I've certainly learned a lot.",
        "And one of the things I've learned is that, you know, if you're a bisexual woman, they assume that you're really straight, you really want to be with men.",
        "And if you're a bisexual man, they assume you're really gay, you really want to be with men.",
        "And so I think that the lesson here is we all really want be to be with men.",
        "Men are, in some ways, more important.",
        "I think sex without a man - is it even sex?",
        "Well, you know, since we're not able to talk about the gender differences necessarily, let me ask about cultural differences.",
        "In fact, are there cultural difference or even racial connotations to bisexuality?",
        "For example, does it differ in any way from group to, let's say, another group?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "It absolutely does.",
        "I would say in the Native American world I have experienced on the surface - I'm not Native American, but when I'm interacting in Native American communities I've experienced that on the surface, it seems incredibly hostile to bisexuality or homosexuality.",
        "But a little bit deeper down and with more of a traditional understanding of the culture there's actually a tremendous history that understands kind of the fluidity of gender, A, and also fluidity of sexuality and who we love, and has a lot of space, I think, to be honoring.",
        "Within the African-American community, I guess I've seen more of a sense that bisexuality is very dubious.",
        "The people are encouraged - I think you could say this across the board - but people are really encouraged to deny bisexuality.",
        "And so when it does come up, it's more harmful for everybody involved.",
        "I think the bisexual person has to lie about their relationships, and then the people who are being lied to are, you know, being portrayed in various ways.",
        "I'm white, and I guess I would say in my world - and again, being raised in Fargo, North Dakota - I find that there's a lot of tolerance but not necessarily acceptance or understanding.",
        "And I think tolerance of gay people's is kind of based on this idea of, oh well they were born that way, there's really nothing we can do about it.",
        "God made them that way, so, you know, whatever.",
        "But acceptance and understanding is actually a lot deeper.",
        "It requires relationships, and imagining and actually respecting that somebody could choose to love somebody of the same gender even when they have the option not to and really believing that it is a choice and that it can be a beautiful, honorable choice.",
        "Well, to follow the point about understanding even further.",

        "While the Trump administration says it has abandoned its policy of separating migrant parents and children at the border, thousands of families are still in detention, putting their children at grave risk of physical and emotional harm.",

        "They are Dr. Scott Allen, a specialist in internal medicine from Riverside, Calif., and Dr. Pamela McPherson, a child psychologist in Shreveport, La.",
        "They both had extensive prior experience working in detention settings when DHS asked them to look into facilities in three states - Pennsylvania, Texas and New Mexico.",

        "When I spoke with them the other day, Dr. Allen told me that poor treatment was not necessarily because staff at the facilities weren't trying or didn't care.",
        "Rather, it was a result of the facilities not having adequately trained professionals.",
        "Particularly, there were shortage of pediatricians, especially early on.",
        "So that what was happening is that children with significant illness were presenting to the health care providers who were trying to provide their care, but they were missing some of the most basic things about pediatric care.",
        "For example, one of the basic vital signs that clinicians follow in young children is their weight.",
        "And, in particular, if a child is presenting with a diarrheal disease, you follow that weight quite closely.",
        "In the first facility we visited, we came upon a 18-month-old infant, a toddler who had been presenting at least eight or 10 times over a 10-day period to health care complaining - the mother complaining of the baby's diarrhea and was sent away repeatedly with reassurance and no particular intervention while the medical record shows the baby lost a third of his body weight under the care of these clinicians.",
        "I'm just following up on the point that you just made, that this isn't necessarily malintent (ph).",
        "It's that people weren't necessarily trained to deal with children.",
        "You identify another facility that accidentally vaccinated numerous children with adult doses of vaccine as a result of poor interagency coordination and the unfamiliarity of the providers with pediatric dosing.",
        "And to your larger point about the - just the conditions in detention more broadly, you said that you found that severe child finger injuries, including lacerations and fractures, because the doors were so heavy.",
        "To your point, you're saying this is not a matter of intent, but this is the result.",
        "You know what I just realized?",
        "Well, I'd say at the local level in the facilities, it's not a result of malintent.",
        "But we have to back up and say, why are we doing this in the first place?",
        "We would say that the policy of detaining innocent children as part of our immigration program is entirely unnecessary and unjustifiable because of these logistical problems that we're describing, but also that it's well-known in the medical community that the detention of children is harmful to their health.",
        "So at some point, there is the question of, why are we doing this as a country?",
        "Why are we putting innocent children in harm's way?",
        "I asked child psychiatrist Dr. McPherson about the psychological impact of detention on the migrant children.",
        "She told me that she's worried that when they enter the facilities, they are not always screened for trauma.",
        "So the concern that we have is that trauma can really have a lasting impact on a child's development.",
        "It can include impairment in the developmental milestones, thinking, emotional regulation and even the ability to form healthy relationships.",
        "Trauma may cause some children to regress and lose skills, or it may cause other children to mature too quickly and take on adult behaviors too early.",
        "Do these psychological effects still occur when children are detained with parents?",
        "I mean, certainly, as you know, this is one proposal that the administration has made.",
        "Yes.",
        "The concern is that because the effects of trauma are cumulative, placing children in high-stress situations where they don't have the supports of their community, extended family, church, regular schools, where they're in a different culture, this is very stressful.",
        "And this traumatic stress can lead to ongoing difficulties for children.",
        "Detaining children can also damage the bond between the parent and child because in a detention setting, the parent's authority is weakened by the rules and the oversight of the facility."
