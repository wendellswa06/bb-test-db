        "I don't know the answer to that.",
        "But that's the way I like to think of the question.",

        "And that's one way to think about the question.",
        "The other is to think about how we divide the slices of the pie of that prosperity and that's where the mobility issues come in.",
        "I think the caller's absolutely right to pick up on the question of debt.",
        "One of my colleagues, Bob Davis, did a story in our series that looked just at that and observed that there are a lot of people in America who want to have more stuff, more goods and services, better trips and so forth than their parents did, don't have the income to do it, but are able to an extraordinary degree in America today, to borrow and to buy that stuff, and many of them do get into trouble and there's--it's good reason to worry about it.",
        "His piece was set in Utah and the lead example was a guy whose name was Benjamin Franklin Baggett, who was named by his father, who was an admirer for Benjamin Franklin, and gave him all that stuff that Franklin talked about thrift, and then promptly proceeded to ignore it all.",
        "Yeah, that thrift part turns out to matter.",
