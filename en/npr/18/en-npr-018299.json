        "Appreciate it.",
        "As we mentioned earlier, not long ago, most economists believe the US was an economically mobile society.",
        "Some began to rethink that conventional wisdom.",
        "To help us understand, we turn to Gary Solon, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan.",
        "He's with us by phone from his office in Ann Arbor.",
        "Nice of you to be with us today.",
        "Well, thank you for inviting me.",
        "Oh, well, where we went wrong, it was really both economists and sociologists, was before we had access to these new better data sets, until about 15 years ago, it was very, very difficult to get any data on incomes of both generations from the same family.",
        "So researchers were sort of forced to work with whatever they could get and what they could get wasn't very good.",
        "They were odd data sets with not such good measurements of income and on--very unrepresentative samples, and we've come to understand since then that the data deficiencies led systematically to underestimation of how strong the link is between parents' income and children's income.",
        "And what helps us figure this out was much better data sets.",
        "One of those, as a Michigan prof, I'm proud to say, is a University of Michigan survey called the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which since the late 1960s has been following a nationally--a national probability sample of thousands of American families, and going back to them year after year, and asking them, `Well, how much money did you make last year?",
        "along with a battery of many other questions.",
        "And in addition to having pretty good income measures from this year after year on the same folks, this survey has followed the kids from the original families as they've grown up to become adults and formed their own households so that for some years now there has been an intergenerational span to the data set so that we're able to look at how strong is the relationship between the kids' incomes and the incomes of their parents.",
        "Around the same time, the late '60s, there was also another data set, fairly similar, although different in certain respects, called the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience.",
        "Interestingly, it's partly operated by Ohio State so Michigan and Ohio State are competing in the intergenerational data field as well as the football field.",
        "And so quite a bit of the research has been done with that data set also.",
        "And these data sets have given us a lot better information, first, because they're working with nationally representative samples, and, secondly, because their so-called longitudinal surveys, which go back and collect the income information repeatedly over the years.",
        "We now have a much better handle on the longer run income of the people in those surveys.",
        "Well, hang with us, and we'll get to what that means when we get to more of our calls from our listeners.",
        "And the question, again, is: Are you doing better than your parents did?",
        "Do you expect your children to do better than you did?",
        "Is the engine, the economic escalator in America, is it working for you and your family?",
        "Has it stuttered?",

        "Yeah, I was listening to you.",
        "It was interesting when he mentioned legacy because when you posed the question--I--my--I'm a--much better off now than my parents and I come from a divorced mama in the '60s.",
        "She was a single parent before it became fashionable.",
        "But the--I think part of the issue is, too, when you look at family legacy, is I started at the bottom rung of the ladder and was able to climb to the top, shall we say, and since I'm so high, will my kids be better off than me, I'm not sure that that's going to be all that easy for them.",
        "I think the legacy I left them is that I hope they at least break even, stay at ...(technical difficulties).",
        "OK, Ken.",
        "Again, your phone's breaking up so I'm going to let you go but I think we got your point.",
        "Appreciate the phone call.",
        "Sure.",
        "Did you run across that in--as you talked to people around the country, David?",
        "I think that there are two--as I said earlier, there's two different ways to think about this.",
        "One is: Will our kids live better than we do?",
        "Depends a lot on what happens to the whole level of living standards in the United States.",
        "And there's always a surprising amount of doubt in America about that but the evidence is, given what's happened to productivity and wages over time, that our kids, on average, will live better than other people, than we did.",
        "It is, of course, true, that if you're at the top, your kids have nowhere to go but down.",
        "The facts are, though, that not a lot of kids fall out of that top tier into the bottom.",
        "Maybe Gary can shed some light on that, but I don't think there's--I don't think that that's--there's not--there's surprisingly little of that, as I look at the data.",
        "They may not fall to the bottom, but, Gary Solon, do they fall to the middle sometimes?",
        "Well...",
        "Right.",
        "I think we do know a few things and we don't know a lot of things.",
        "One thing we know is that millions of immigrants prefer the United States to their home country and it looks like, despite all that we've been through, 9/11, the war in Iraq, and everything, that an awful lot of immigrants, if they had a choice, would come here rather than go to some other country.",
        "So that tells you--and they're--these immigrants are very much in touch with their relatives and friends who have come already, so they may expect the streets to be paved with gold and not find them, but they choose to come here, and that tells us something about our society."

        "Yeah.",

        "Well, on average, though, they'll go somewhat in that direction.",
        "As David's been reporting in this series of articles, one thing, you know, that we academic researchers have been finding is that the connection between parents' relative income status and kids' relative income status when they grow up is stronger than we used to realize.",
        "But another thing we've looked at, which I think he was just referring to, is whether there's any asymmetry in that.",
        "That is, whether rags to riches is more or less common than riches to rags.",
        "And there seems to be some indication in the data, not just in the United States but in some other countries as well, that riches to rags is less common.",

        "Why have we allowed allegedly stagnant old European countries to outpace us in these areas?",
        "Is that comparison to old Europe, if you will--Is that accurate, Gary Solon?",
        "Yeah, as we start to get good intergenerational income data from other countries, one of the maybe surprising and maybe not so surprising finding is that connection between the generations and relative income status is relatively high in the United States compared to many other developed countries.",
        "Maybe that shouldn't be so surprising because it's been apparent for a long time that there's relatively high income inequality in the United States and these two things do tend to go together.",
        "But I think Bradford started off by asking why do we even have this belief that this is a highly mobile society, relatively speaking.",
        "And I think, Neal, you mentioned what's probably a reason for that, which is immigration.",
        "The statistical evidence we're talking about relating income between generations is about families where the parents are already in the United States.",
        "And this in no way denies that when somebody immigrates to America from a very poor country or they were poor and are probably going to stay poor, they're doing it in the hope of having a better economic level of living in the United States.",
        "And in many cases their hopes are realized to some extent for themselves and probably often for their children also.",
        "So I think the idea of America as the land of opportunity is very tied up with the immigrants' experience and, you know, that's a valid aspect of thinking of America as the land of opportunity.",

        "Good to be with you.",
        "And you're the group that has been measuring economic mobility amongst immigrants but it's a difficult thing to measure.",
        "Yeah, because you have to measure it over time, and it takes a while for any immigrant to catch up because of lack of familiarity with the labor markets and lack of familiarity with the language and then there are characteristics, particularly among Hispanic immigrants, that land them at the bottom of the labor force, particularly their lack of education.",
        "Now, of course, you mentioned the largest and newest immigrants.",
        "Many of them are Latinos.",
        "What do we know about first generation success compared to the second and so on?",
        "Well, the--we really only have two generations to look at in the current wave of immigration that began in the 1970s and '80s.",
        "The third generation, the people who've traced their roots here as far back as their grandparents or more really came before this big runup which really has accelerated in the last 10 years.",
        "And so we know that it can often take 20 years for an immigrant to catch up to the level of native-borns who have the same levels of education, for example.",
        "And the early returns are that the second generation does significantly better than the first, but you would expect that because we're talking about people who are born here.",
        "They don't have immigration issues.",
        "They speak English as a native language and they're the products of US schools.",
        "But they don't do all that well.",
        "At least in the early returns, there's a wide spread, and there are a lot of second-generation Latinos who are sort of on the front edge of a big cohort that's still very young but the front edge is--there are a great many who are ending up at the low end of the labor force.",
        "And have not found ways for them or their children to move ahead.",

        "So is their experience here as Americans similar to the experience of people who were born in this country like I was?",
