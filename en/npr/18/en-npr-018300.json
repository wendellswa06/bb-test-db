        "And the other thing is that having skills and education in the US is a real necessity; that immigrants who come here and who don't speak English and don't have much education are competing with lots of other people like them and a lot of native-born Americans for jobs that simply don't pay very well.",
        "And there's a lot more people there than there are jobs.",

        "What do you think about the idea of class inflation?'",
        "I think it's absolutely true that the standard of living in the United States today, in 2005, is much better than it was in 1955, and for most people, much better than it was in 1975.",
        "If you live at the middle of the middle class, particularly beginning about the mid-'90s, things really started to get better.",
        "And there's no arguing that.",
        "There--it's clear that there was, during the '70s and '80s, some kind of stalling in that progress as productivity growth slowed, as more people had to have two spouses in the work force to have the kind of lifestyle that one of their parents managed to deliver.",
        "But when you think about health care and air quality and the devices that we have and the trips we can take and the deregulation of airlines allowing us to fly to Disneyland, which didn't even exist in 1950, there's no denying that.",
