        "Whether it is propaganda - they might argue that some of the things that the United States does over Voice of America and other outlets is also propaganda, but the more the merrier.",
        "I think people in the United States, given all the freedom we have to know what is going on in the world, need to use that freedom and not just sit back and wait for some canned, packaged news weekly or news nightly program, but should actually go out and do some research.",

        "Well, I think the no-time limit is the issue here.",
        "There should be some kind of oversight.",
        "There should be some kind of restrictions placed on how long you can detain someone while determining whether they are indeed terrorists.",
        "That's the key word here, is terrorists and terrorism.",
        "The fact that they are being detained is not necessarily because they are trying to enter the country illegally, it's because they supposedly are suspected of being terrorists or somehow involved with terrorists.",
        "So as we're sorting out all of this stuff, I think we need to keep in mind that these are kind of two separate issues.",
        "Whether we're dealing with people who are coming into the country illegally, period, or whether we're dealing with the terrorism issue.",

        "But in this case, until more facts are available to me, it's difficult for me to see how extending these already difficult and indefensible policies of indefinite detainment and not being able to appeal it while you're there - it seems to me that anybody who would agree with this or put this forth the way I'm aware of it this morning is someone who has never read a book and does not have the moral authority to raise children.",
