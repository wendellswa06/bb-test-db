        "So what kind of makeover will the Butterfinger candy bar get?",
        "Well, Mohr says its bright colored filling, which is currently made with a mix of red dye number 40 and yellow number five, will be replaced with a natural coloring called annatto.",
        "Annatto is a common, natural colorant that comes from the seeds of a tree that grows in the sub-tropic region.",
        "And Mohr says the goal is to have all of Nestle's chocolates reformulated by the end of the year.",
        "So how significant is this move to toss out artificial coloring?",
        "Well, pediatrician Andrew Adesman, who's a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, says he sees Nestle's move as a positive step, following in the footsteps of other big food companies, such as Kraft, that have moved towards more natural colorings.",
        "There have been long-standing concerns that artificial food coloring might affect children's behavior.",
        "And there's indeed some research that suggests that it can have modest effects.",

        "And as we learn more about the shooting, it just seemed that the doctor was an usher in his Lutheran church there.",
        "And this man was part of the congregation and came up with a handgun and shot him in the head.",
        "Well, I think part of the congregation might not be exactly accurate.",
        "Well, he was with the congregation.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There are indications that he has visited that church several times.",
        "And the shooting actually took place in sort of the lobby area outside of the sanctuary during a service.",
        "They left a few people outside to, you know, greet people who showed up late, and Dr. Tiller was one of them.",
        "And it was interesting to me that in your piece in the Wichita Eagle this morning you said that there had been many people saying a cooling of anti-abortion ardor at the statehouse lately, that the debate had, well, settled down.",
        "There has been sort of stalemate as you described."

        "Kansas abortion politics are maybe a little bit different than what you might experience on one coast or the other.",
        "Think of it like a football game where one team is always on offense.",
        "The - basically, year after year, the legislature would pass measures that were either directly or indirectly designed to make it difficult to impossible for Dr. Tiller to do business here.",
        "And in the last five to six years, there's been a Democrat in the governor's office, Kathleen Sebelius, now the Health and Human Services Secretary.",
        "And so, the legislature would pass the laws and then the governor would veto the laws, we'd have a veto session and they would fall a few votes short.",
        "People have kind of, you know, settled into trenches.",
        "The measures that were proposed this year were fairly technical in nature.",
        "So, it wasn't - this is very unexpected pretty much all across the board.",
        "And you also talked with people on both sides of the debate.",
        "And on the pro-life side, people said, first of all, at least according to your article, everyone you spoke to said they denounced the shooting and said this was not the way to do it and that they had no belief that this man was in any way connected to any of their organizations.",
        "And if he was, it would be a step back.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think, well, what we have here in Kansas, there's a three -there are three pretty prominent organizations involved in this.",
        "And all of the leaders of those organizations were quick to denounce this shooting and trying to distance themselves from the politics of it.",
        "It's - that may be hard to do.",
        "We'll just have to see how that plays out.",
        "There's another component to this as well, which was that for the more pro-choice side in Kansas, Dr. Tiller's money was a huge factor.",
        "He, you know, financed several campaigns and, really, was one of the people who was responsible for replacing a very pro-life attorney general in the state with a Democrat who was more pro-choice.",
        "There's a quote I wanted to read to listeners in your piece from Cathleen Mahoney, vice president and general counsel of the National Abortion Federation, said that she called the Tiller shooting a setback for everybody who believes in the rule of law, and said it would be harder for sides to find common ground.",
        "How do you meet in the middle with people who kill those that don't agree with them?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, it's a valid question.",
        "I think that, you know, it's a danger that Kansas knew was always there, especially with Dr. Tiller because he was so - he was a very defiant individual as far as - when people would try to stop him from doing what he very strongly believe was the right thing to do.",
        "And on the pro-life side, has there been any question there has been, as always, hyperbolic rhetoric in the past, people would not - some of the people on that side would not have described Dr. Tiller's an abortion provider but as a mass murderer?",
        "And did they accept that if this proves to have been abortion-related that this escalation of rhetoric maybe in any way responsible?",
        "Well, I think one of the things that you see here is - you know, the rhetoric is always there.",
        "It's probably ramped up a little bit because of -in fact, it's ramped up probably pretty considerably because the Democratic Party taking control of the reins of government in Washington.",
        "The - you know, I mean, it's really one of those things that's too early to say.",
        "I mean, we don't know for sure, you know, how involved or if involved that the suspect was in the anti-abortion movement, that's one of the things that we're still trying to get a handle on."

        "Of course, yesterday, there in Wichita, a Dr. George Tiller, one of the operators of a clinic for women's health, that was one of the few in the country that provided late-term abortions, was shot and killed as he performed as an usher at his church on Sunday morning.",

        "You have an extreme here of the doctor who was performing late-term abortions, then you have the extreme of the pro-life movement that's actually taking the life of the doctor.",
        "And so, I'm just kind of wondering, you know, how does that - I guess my statement is, is that as one human being, you know, pro-life, it's difficult for me to see a situation like this because it lets the extremes on both ends dictate the issue."

        "I'm not actually equating them.",
        "I'm just - I guess for me, I'm standing by the fact that someone that would call themselves pro-life would actually go that extreme.",

        "Yes, exactly, that is the big fear.",

        "And, you know, frankly, really, almost you might say we're the capital of the anti-abortion movement here.",
        "On the other hand, you know, Dr. Tiller was the chief funder of pretty much all pro-life - pro-choice politics in Kansas.",
        "So we're not really sure how it's all going to work out.",
        "Now, the debate in Kansas doesn't necessarily take place on the ground of what you might see in Los Angeles or New York.",
        "It's more that you - I think the pro-life movement has realized here, that they can't outlaw abortion completely so they try to make them regulations to make it extremely difficult to perform the operations.",
        "On the other hand, you've got the pro-choice people.",
        "You know, they're not really putting any initiatives out there, so it's a little different debate.",

        "This also comes, Dion Lefler, as the -there was a recent Gallup poll that suggested that opinion on abortion had actually shifted in this country toward the pro-life side, sort of, outside of the context of Kansas in - on the national level - there might be some concern that if the pro-life movement is associated with vigilante tactics like this, again, that could cut in to those gains.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that it could.",
        "I mean, you know, every time there's an incident like this, I mean, you will - one prominent pro-life person here in town told me that he thought that if this guy is linked to the movement then it's going to set them back 20 years.",
