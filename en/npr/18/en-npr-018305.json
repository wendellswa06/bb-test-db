        "Right.",
        "I guess one of the main things that I, as somebody who is pro-life, gets frustrated with the whole abortion issue is many ways we focus so in on the act of abortion rather at focusing in on the reasons that women decide to get an abortion.",
        "And if we address those issues as to why women are getting an abortion and why can't we make more options readily available in - show more support to women who find themselves pregnant unexpectedly.",
        "I think that if we - the two sides can work together for that, we could maybe reduce the number of abortions that we have in this nation and avoid catastrophes like this."
