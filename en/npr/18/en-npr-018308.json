        "The traditional way of making the measurement involves taking blood smears, looking at them under a conventional microscope by a trained individual, counting them manually.",

        "Fletcher has been working on novel ways to use iPhones as the centerpiece of inexpensive, portable microscopes.",

        "They are only present in the bloodstream between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. The tests all have to be done during that timeframe, so being quick is really important.",

        "In three minutes, start to finish, the process can tell the health worker whether it's safe to give the person ivermectin.",
        "Three minutes a test from 11:00 to 1:00 each day works out to 40 tests a day per device.",
        "That's much faster than the conventional method, but the numbers are still daunting.",
        "I don't see how it could be scaled up to the scale of tens of millions of people.",
        "Gary Weil says that's how many people live in areas where both Loa loa and the river blindness parasites are found together.",
        "And it wouldn't just be a one-time test, since the treatment for river blindness is a once-a-year treatment - every year, they would have to be tested."
