        "Sherman says throughout his life, Jonathan has found strategies that allow him to work around his brain's limitations.",
        "For example, she says, when Jonathan was younger, he didn't have a clear concept of a face.",
        "But he realized he could refer to a concrete example to help him.",
        "Putting together a puzzle of a face, he initially had put the eyes in the wrong place and then looked at my face and said oh, no, actually your nose goes between your eyes, so I did that wrong.",
        "Sherman says Jonathan's success suggests that using similar workarounds could help hundreds of thousands of people who have damage to the cerebellum from a stroke or tumor or infection.",
        "What scientists are learning about the cerebellum also could help people with other brain disorders.",
        "Jeremy Schmahmann is a neurology professor at Harvard who has also worked with Jonathan since he was a teenager.",
        "Schmahmann says it's intriguing that problems with things like abstract thought also affect people with a very common diagnosis.",
        "You have to actually think about it, bring it to conscious awareness and then it flows.",
        "Schmahmann says there's growing evidence that the cerebellum is involved in autism and also, he says, in schizophrenia.",
        "Schmahmann says that this made him wonder whether he could help people with these disorders by making the cerebellum work better.",
        "Can I do something?",
        "Can I take the theory and turn it into therapy?",
        "Schmahmann says he's already taken an important step toward that goal.",
        "What we're doing is reusing transcranial magnetic stimulation, a relatively new technique, and we are stimulating the cerebellum to see if we can make a difference in patients who have schizophrenia.",
        "Schmahmann says the results so far are encouraging.",
        "It's a small study and we're still recruiting for that, but the preliminary data and the first published study shows that, in fact, we seem to make a difference."
