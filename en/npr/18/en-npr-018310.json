        "BuzzFeed has a brand, too, Bankoff says, and stands in some peril of blurring it.",
        "A brand that at once floods the zone with a lot of interesting, cute lists; and also has aspirations to be a journalistic outlet, you know, really has to reconcile with exactly how they're going to build brand identity around two things that might not be compatible, in a lot of cases.",

        "And then cute animals and jokes and humor and Internet geek culture started to emerge on those platforms, and that's really where BuzzFeed started.",
        "But then, Peretti said, the Arab Spring happened and played out on Facebook, and people took to Twitter to monitor breaking news.",
        "Hiring reporters is expensive for BuzzFeed, as it is for everyone else, and yet it proved necessary to draw certain kinds of news readers and advertisers.",

        "On Twitter, news junkies and experts may share BuzzFeed's more detailed stories; while Facebook users may be curious, but less well-informed.",
        "They're aiming for people under 40, hence stories about gay rights in Russia ahead of the Winter Olympics, or a post focusing on racist tweets after the crowning of the first Miss America of Asian-Indian descent - 5.7 million people clicked on that link.",
        "That's a lot of people.",
        "Kelly McBride argues the posting was successfully designed to be hugely popular.",
        "But as a result, she says, BuzzFeed misled readers about the extent to which the new Miss America sparked a racist response.",
        "People who were sharing it, were sharing it because they were outraged - not because they shared the sentiments of the tweeters that were making the posts.",
        "McBride is a senior scholar at the Poynter Institute, a journalism school in St. Petersburg, Fla.",
        "She says BuzzFeed missed the larger story - that people overwhelmingly embraced the new Miss America."
