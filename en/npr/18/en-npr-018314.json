        "In the Rocky Flats Arsenal, in Colorado, there was a wastewater well and they pumped a lot of water down there and they got a 4.8 magnitude quake.",
        "So, what exactly does the water do to the fault?",
        "Well, if you want try to visualize a fault, and let's say you put your hands together like praying, OK?",
        "You open up with your fingers extended, and then that line between your hands is the fault.",
        "So press your hands together hard and that's called clamping pressure.",
        "It's keeping that fault stable.",
