        "Now all the people in the study had brain MRIs done before the study and again a year later when the study ended.",
        "Researcher Art Kramer.",
        "And what we found is that the individuals in the aerobic group showed increases in the volume of their hippocampus.",
        "Two percent bigger after a year of aerobic exercise.",
        "For those in the control group, who did toning, stretching, light weight-lifting for the year, well, their hippocampus shrunk about one and a half percent, suggesting that not only did the aerobic exercise protect against normal shrinkage but also that new cells were added to the hippocampus.",
        "Again, neuroscientist Peter Snyder.",
        "To see a volume change in a structure of about two percent means that there really is very significant change going on in that region of the brain.",
        "The growth of the hippocampus in the aerobic group was also associated with improvements in spatial memory - an important kind of memory that records information about your environment, like the layout of your neighborhood, or the interior of the grocery store.",
        "For this study, Kramer looked only at spatial memory, but in previous studies, verbal and other types of memory improved after an aerobic exercise program.",
        "As for Greg Stanton, the 66-year-old semi-couch potato, he says he didn't notice any improvement in his memory.",
        "I always had difficulty remembering names and it's getting worse, actually."

        "The 23-year-old woman was going to meet a truck driver.",
        "He wasn't sure exactly what time, you know, he's a truck driver, you know, you run into traffic, it was cold, the weather, he had to go through the mountains.",
        "The trucker had something that Lindsey was determined to get - breast milk for her baby.",
        "I was waiting at the rest area, and he told me on the phone that his truck was red, and he was hauling logs, so that narrowed it down.",
        "And I saw him pull in, and then I saw him get out of the truck, and I just, you know, took a guess and walked over there and sure enough it was him, and he had the cooler full of milk.",
        "The cooler held more than five gallons of his wife's breast milk.",
        "I mean, it was kind of suspicious-looking, I'm sure, with coolers and exchange from a truck driver, and here I am this little frail-looking woman going up and picking up the coolers.",
        "I'm sure it looked awkward.",
        "Lindsey had connected with the trucker's wife on Facebook.",
        "And since the woman lived about six hours away in West Virginia, Lindsey was happy that the trucker offered to deliver the milk.",
        "I gave him a big old hug because I was very thankful for, you know, going out of his way and everything.",
        "I got into the car and before I started driving I got on my cell phone on Facebook and messaged his wife.",
        "I said, I hugged your husband, I hope that's okay.",
        "I was just, you know, so thankful.",
        "This is not a journey that Lindsey has taken on lightly.",
