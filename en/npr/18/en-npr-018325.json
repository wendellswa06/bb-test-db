        "The report obtained by NPR is the latest twist in an ongoing debate.",
        "And as NPR's defense correspondent Guy Raz reports, that debate is getting personal.",
        "A couple of weeks ago, Defense Secretary Robert Gates sent a subtle but unmistakable message to the Army when he announced...",
        "General David Petraeus is the new commander of Central Command.",
        "As head of Central Command, Petraeus will oversee the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "The post is arguably the highest-profile assignment in the U.S.",
        "military today.",
        "And Patraeus's elevation to head Central Command is in a sense an affirmation.",
        "An affirmation of the fact that the counterinsurgency doctrine he wrote and the counterinsurgency strategy he implemented in Iraq was successful.",
        "This is Lieutenant Colonel John Nagl.",
        "Nagl's one of the Army's top experts on counterinsurgency doctrine.",
        "His book on counterinsurgency, \"\"Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife,\"\" is a modern classic on the subject.",
        "Nagl served a tour in Iraq from 2003 to 2004, where he was based in Anbar Province.",
        "It was there that he realized the U.S.",
        "Army had gotten itself tangled up in an insurgency.",
        "And so what I saw was an Army that was not as ready to fight this kind of war as it should have been, and so I came back from Iraq determined to help the Army learn how to do this kind of war more effectively.",
        "So Nagl got to work on the Army's counterinsurgency handbook, better known as Field Manual 3-24.",
        "The manual is like a road map for officers: It emphasizes the use of minimal force.",
        "The idea, Nagle explains, in a counterinsurgency campaign is to drive a wedge between the civilian population and the insurgents who live among them.",
        "Colonel Peter Mansoor, a top aid to General Petraeus, also helped write the manual.",
        "Mansoor, who spoke from Baghdad, is part of General Petraeus's famed brain trust of advisers - a group of officers and civilians who live and breathe counterinsurgency doctrine.",
        "The people are the prize in a counterinsurgency operation.",
        "They are the key terrain, if you will, on which victory or defeat rests."

        "Now, the man most closely identified with counterinsurgency doctrine is General David Petraeus.",
        "Petraeus oversaw the writing of Field Manual 3-24.",
        "And when he testified in front of Congress last month, Petraeus highlighted the doctrine as a reason for the decline in violence in Iraq.",
        "A second factor has been the employment of coalition and Iraqi forces in the conduct of counterinsurgency operations across the country.",
        "Within the obsessive and rarified world of what's known as the counterinsurgency community - or in shorthand, the coin community - Petraeus is practically regarded as the son of god, and soldiers like Peter Mansoor and John Nagl are viewed as the apostles.",
        "So is an Army colonel named Sean MacFarland.",
        "MacFarland was among the first to successfully apply counterinsurgency doctrine in Iraq back in 2006.",
        "And yet a recent internal Army report MacFarland co-authored implies that the Army is far too focused on counterinsurgency training, and this singular focus, he writes, is weakening the Army.",
        "The example he gives is what he calls the alarming deterioration of the Army's field artillery units.",
        "Since 1775, the year America's Army was founded, artillery units have served as the backbone of the force.",
        "But today, 90 percent of artillery units are uncertified.",
        "They're not ready for battle.",
        "And a major reason why is because artillery soldiers are doing other jobs.",
        "What would have happened without this bailout of Bear Stearns?",
        "What would the worst-case scenario have been?",
        "I think that we were really on the brink of a financial collapse and I think the Fed saw it coming.",
        "The debt to equity for Bear Stearns before this crisis began was 28-to-1.",
        "So that meant that Bear Stearns only had about a little over 3 percent of its total balance sheet in the form of equity.",
        "All the rest was debt.",
        "If Bear Stearns had gone under, had declared bankruptcy, what would the ripple effects of that have been?",
        "I think that it would have been huge.",
        "First of all, all the counterparties - that is the various firms that deal with Bear Stearns, that trade with Bear Stearns - now have to take care of their own shortfalls in their positions as a result of the failure of Bear Stearns.",
        "So that would be the first sort of immediate effect.",
        "The other thing would be that those counterparties, they're going to have to start selling some of their assets.",
        "And as they try to sell some of their assets, those assets' values are going to plunge in the market, causing people who don't have anything to do with Bear Stearns to suffer large losses.",
        "And third, what we all would have learned if the Fed hadn't stepped in is that the Fed was prepared to allow an implosion of the financial system.",
        "That would have made everyone even more frightened because the role of the lender of last resort is not to allow that to happen.",
        "So those three things together would have taken out already extremely hazardous situation prior to this crisis and turned it into a disaster."

        "The treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, talked this weekend and he used the term moral hazard to describe the risks of a bailout like the one the Fed did, but he said the stability of the markets required it.",
        "What do you think he means when he talks about a moral hazard?",
        "What's he talking about?",
        "Anytime a government or a government agency like the Fed steps in to fill the gap left by the market, you're sending, in some sense, a signal to people that, well, when things get really bad, you can rely on the government.",
        "That creates a tendency for people to do more risky things.",
        "So that's the so-called moral hazard problem or cost.",
        "But, of course, there are times when the risks to the financial system are real, and when those risks are real, you have to be willing to intervene because the benefits are greater than the costs.",
        "When you look at these actions that the Fed has taken very quickly, this bailout of Bear Stearns, the open-ended lending program for a number of other investment banks, what do you think that says about the view that the Federal Government should stay out of financial markets?",
        "Well, the Fed is not bailing out the financial system.",
        "The Fed is providing collateralized lending to help the financial system manage itself.",
        "It's not a highly interventionist action.",
        "I think what's striking about this intervention is that it's been accompanied by an immediate transaction where JP Morgan bought Bear Stearns with one and a half days of diligence as far as I can tell.",
        "All the Fed has really done is facilitate an orderly transaction between private parties.",
        "Now, it has taken on some risks though the collateralized lending, but again, that's not the same as a very heavy-handed intervention or taking the institutions over.",
        "But more intervention to come, you think?",
        "I hope not.",
        "And I don't think necessarily that's going to happen.",
        "Bear was in a uniquely vulnerable position.",
        "I think that we've seen very possibly the last major problem of a large financial institution and that what we are going to see now is even more aggressive actions by the Fed to create liquidity for other financial institutions to avoid a repeat.",

        "The book is called \"\"It Takes a Family,\"\" which plays off Hillary Clinton's book title, \"\"It Takes a Village.\"\" Santorum says he's critiquing the ideology of the left, and he also questions some conservatives."
