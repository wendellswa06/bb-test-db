        "The wars we're fighting now are counterinsurgency wars, and for those who argue that the Army and the Marine Corps and in fact the whole military should go back to training for high-intensity combat operations, my response would be we have two wars that we're fighting now, and we need to prosecute them to the best of our ability.",

        "And he argues that that viewpoint encourages a more interventionist posture within the Army - a position that will make it far easier, he says, for the Army to wage war in the future.",
        "I think it's downright dangerous because it suggests that we can repeat the folly of Iraq, that somehow or another next time we can get it right without understanding that if the population is living within a social structure that doesn't want to change, if the population doesn't want you in the country, if there is no legitimate government to begin with, your intervention is doomed to inevitable failure."
