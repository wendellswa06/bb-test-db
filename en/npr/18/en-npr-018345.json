        "I responded back in a column that I did a couple of weeks ago where I said, well, first of all, Mexicans are voting for Obama.",
        "They are not voting in numbers that are getting Obama victories in California and Texas, but in the state of Illinois, which nobody ever mentions, Latinos actually voted for Obama more than they did for Hillary Clinton.",
        "Also, historically, Latinos have voted for, specifically Mexicans, have voted for black candidates.",
        "In Chicago, they voted for Harold Washington.",
        "In L.A., of course, they voted for Tom Bradley for 20 some years.",

        "But, why?",
        "Because he refers to himself as black.",
        "Well, that's why we do it, yes.",
        "Thank you, thank you, girl, for knowing.",
        "Because what we get is \"\"he's, he's part black and his mom was white and both of his parentage,\"\" and they just get really mad.",
        "And I go \"\"sweetie, sweetie, calls himself black.",
        "That's why we do it.\"\" And then they go, \"\"Oh.",
        "But isn't it so funny how white people always want to claim the biracial people after they've made it, like Halle Berry when she won an Oscar, all of a sudden it was like, \"\"but her mom is white.\"\" And yeah.",

        "Well, one of the questions that we've been discussing is why it is that the media seems really fixated on this idea that Asian-Americans are overwhelmingly for Clinton, and there is this whole generational gap that I don't think is getting analyzed at all.",
        "From as far as I can tell, younger Asian-Americans, people in their twenties and thirties, seem very overwhelmingly in favor, actually, of Obama.",
        "There is a lot of really active work being done there.",
        "But then, whenever the media covers it, which is almost never, I must add, what they do, like CNN did a couple of months ago, is they send a camera crew out to an Asian grocery store in Seattle, and, literally, talk to five different people with heavy Asian-Chinese-Japanese accents, and then they bring in one academic.",
        "His quote is cut down to, well, Asians are kind of racist, so maybe that's why they won't vote for a black person.",
        "OK, that was their idea of science.",
        "So that is sort of the same thing, Gustavo, that you are also hearing, that Mexicans are racist?",
        "At all!",

        "You couldn't have told me, you know, two years ago we'd have an election where nobody cared what the white guy had to say at all.",
        "You know, what Carmen just said, mainstream media does the exact same things with Mexicans.",
        "Where they go to, in our case, instead of going to a supermarket, they'll go to a day-labor center, or they'll go to a rodeo, you know, stereotypically Mexican things.",

        "In fact, most of the young Mexican-Americans that I know, we all voted for Obama.",

        "If you are a black person, you are supporting Obama, it's because he's black.",

        "And I want to ask that question specifically to Carmen.",
        "Well, it certainly seems that way.",
        "I mean, I think, maybe, McCain is just a less interesting story at this point, but I would imagine that, when we finally figure out who the Democratic nominee is, then we'll hear about McCain.",
        "And, of course, McCain has this skeleton in his closet about, where he basically publicly referred to his - when he was a prisoner of war, he referred to the people holding him captive as - I'm not even sure I can use this racial word..."
