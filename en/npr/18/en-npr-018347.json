        "Because in that pile of garbage is the floors, the ceilings, the memories; the baptismal pictures, the wedding photos, the graduation photos, and it just looks like a big ol' pile of junk but it has soul and it has spirit.",
        "Shevlin thinks the tons of accumulated trash in the hardest hit areas of the city are akin to what was referred to as the pile after 9/11.",

        "Ocean temperatures across the equatorial and tropical Pacific Ocean are somewhere upwards of two degrees Celsius above average, so we've had what we would characterize as a strong El Nino.",
        "That's Mike Halpert, deputy director of the Climate Prediction Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
        "Scientists at the center say this is the strongest El Nino since the 1997-98 winter.",
        "What happens is that unusually warm surface temperatures in the Western Pacific move east.",
        "That changes the heating pattern of the atmosphere, which in turn pulls the Pacific jet stream farther south.",
        "A jet stream is a fast and narrow current of air that travels high up in the atmosphere.",
        "And that jet stream is where we see a lot of storminess typically.",
        "And then we saw a very classical case of that, a super strong jet extended all the way across the Pacific with storms impacting California one after the other.",
        "A strong El Nino also alters another jet stream nearer to the equator and brings more storms to the Gulf area.",
        "In fact, a strong El Nino plays havoc with weather from Indonesia to the Atlantic, but in different ways.",
        "Indonesia gets unusually dry weather, and in fact fires in parts of Indonesia have been frequent recently.",
        "Peru, on the west coast of South America, tends to get what California gets - flooding rains.",
        "Halpert says storms are local events and no single storm can be attributed directly to the phenomenon.",
        "One way to think of it is that El Nino conditions the atmosphere for these types of storms.",
        "Halpert also points out that scientists don't know yet whether climate change is influencing the frequency or strength of El Ninos.",
        "Scientists say El Nino will likely persist another month or two.",
        "That usually means drier than usual weather in the Pacific Northwest and Ohio Valley, wetter in the west and southwest, and colder in the southeast.",
        "El Nino has done some good - in the southwestern U.S., for example."

        "And they planted evidence in a roadside hole to make it look like he'd been planting a bomb.",
        "And then they shot him.",
        "Hutchins was the squad leader and according to many of the squad men, he was the mastermind of this plot.",

        "They were angry about an insurgent release.",
