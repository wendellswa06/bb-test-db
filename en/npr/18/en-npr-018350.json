        "Ken?",
        "Chip, in the old days, and I always refer to the old days, but back in 1984, Gary Hart finished a strong second or a surprising second in Iowa, and then tons of money came in, enough - and he actually wound up winning the New Hampshire over Walter Mondale in an upset.",
        "But that was weeks and weeks later.",
        "Now with Florida about to announce their primary schedule, a primary date for January 31, it looks like Iowa and New Hampshire are going to be early January, if you don't have the money now, if you're just getting in the race or if you're somebody like, you know, Chris Christie with two months to go, how do you raise all that money to be competitive in the January caucuses and the primaries?",
        "We spent $1.6 million total, total in Iowa over a year to win the Iowa caucuses.",
        "So you don't have to spend a crazy amount of money.",
        "I think Governor Romney probably spent 10.",
        "So it was at least 10 to one.",
        "And when did you get that money?",
        "When did that money come in for you?",
        "Well, we kept - we raised $300,000 our first quarter, but we saved a lot of it.",
        "We didn't spend as much as other people.",
        "We didn't have a big staff.",
        "We didn't have a big travel budget.",
        "I always used to joke, everybody says I was a genius for keeping Governor Huckabee in Iowa so long, and the truth of it was that we had enough money to fly him to Iowa, we just didn't have enough money to fly him back home.",
        "So we kept him there.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "And so you make those frugal decisions, and then about October happened, and he did very well in the voter value straw poll.",
        "He did - he got a little pop on TV.",
        "We had the Chuck Norris endorsement that we made a kind of a fun little ad that kind of got a lot of encouragement.",
        "Started getting a lot more $100, $50 checks and then, you know, started about December all of a sudden we were second in the polls.",
        "We were close to first, and that's when the money online came in.",
        "The Internet's changed the game.",
        "You can get money instantly now.",
        "You have a good debate performance, and boom, the - your - the online lights up, and you can bank $100,000 overnight for some of these guys like a Herman Cain.",
        "My guess is he had a pretty good day online the day after he won the Florida straw poll.",
        "The key is don't spend that money now.",
        "Save it for when it matters, which is for Herman Cain, I assume that's going to be in Iowa or South Carolina or somewhere along those lines.",
        "We're talking with Chip Saltsman, who managed Mike Huckabee's presidential campaign four years ago, and we'd like to hear what signs you look for to see that your candidate can win amid this season of straw polls and debates as we head up towards caucuses and primaries.",
        "Give us a call, 800-989-8255.",
        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",

        "Well, as, you know, you were mentioning earlier, one of the big important turnouts that we've noticed is that how big the Internet has become in these elections.",
        "And, you know, seeing the last presidential election, I think that it boosted the amount of reach that the candidates had.",
        "And for me that's a big sign.",
        "If you're able to mobilize your base financially, I think that increases exponentially your reach toward the community.",
        "Chip Saltsman, he's making the same point you are, money.",
        "And it's interesting to see all the candidates scrambling at all these fundraisers in the past few days to try to get their figures up for the third-quarter number because we'll come out in a couple of weeks when those figures are given to us and say this is the money primary, this is how much these people have raised.",
        "Absolutely, and that will be the story that dominates the day or two - October 15th when those numbers come out.",
        "The media loves to talk about process: who's raised the most money, who doesn't have much cash on hand, who spent too much money, how much did this person raise or spend?",
        "And that dominates the media for a couple of days.",
        "So it's important to have - we never had any good fundraising figures, compared to John McCain or Mitt Romney or anybody else.",
        "But what we were able to make or do, say look, you're right, we didn't raise a third of the money that anybody else did, but we didn't spend as much, either.",
        "And we've got enough money to compete in Iowa.",
        "You need - we said we needed a million dollars to compete in Iowa.",
        "We had that cash on hand going into Iowa.",
        "So you've got to make that case for each individual case.",
        "For instance, I think Rick Santorum could make a move in Iowa.",
        "He's going to have to prove in the third quarter he's got enough money to compete there.",
        "He doesn't need 10 million dollars, but he needs, you know, probably a million dollars, and if he's been able to save that, then he can be a real factor in Iowa.",
        "So each candidate has their own path.",
        "All of them are different, but, you know, Mitt Romney needs to raise the most money by a big number.",
        "Rick Perry needs to put a big number on the board, let's say 10 million dollars, to prove that he is a national candidate that everybody's kind of getting behind.",
