        "But when do you decide to pull the plug?",
        "It's a great question.",

        "John McCain became the nominee that night.",
        "Governor Huckabee walked up on stage, gave probably the best speech I'd ever give him - seen him give.",

        "If it's Mitt Romney, he's either going to be the nominee, or he's going to get out once that can't happen.",
        "Same with Governor Perry, and I think some of the other folks.",
        "It's very personal.",
        "You make that decision.",

        "He was - he ran for president as a Democrat, a Republican.",
        "I think he ran for vice president.",

        "So what could the consequences of statements like this be for Judge Kavanaugh whether or not he's confirmed to the Supreme Court?",
        "To answer that question, we're joined by Stephen Gillers.",

        "No, I haven't, not even during the confirmation of Clarence Thomas.",

        "So let's say Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court.",
        "Do you think that he can be seen as an impartial arbiter in cases with political undertones?",
        "It depends upon who's doing the seeing.",
        "I think the losers will not see his decision as impartial.",
        "He is now branded as favoring the right over the left.",
        "So in political cases, the left will expect to lose, and they'll attribute that loss not to a disinterested treatment of the law but to a political agenda.",
        "I mean, there's this ideal that a lot of people have about the Supreme Court that these justices, that this court is above politics or should be above politics.",
        "But let me ask you.",
        "How far removed is that ideal from reality?",
        "Very far removed.",
        "First of all, the justice has been appointed by a president of a particular party who, if he's doing his homework, will be sure to appoint a justice who will likely agree with the political position of that party.",
        "So while we have decisions use the language of law, we know that the court's decisions, the justices' decisions are influenced by their political allegiance.",
        "So I guess what I'm really asking is, how productive is it having a conversation about impartiality when impartiality is a bit of a fantasy?",
        "There are - this is a challenging question.",
        "And we don't want any judge to favor a litigant because of particular animus toward a particular litigant.",
        "So impartiality at the very least means unbiased towards the litigants.",

        "The justice may have very definite views on the meaning of the Fourth Amendment or the meaning of privacy.",
        "Right."

        "But you're saying even a very minimal understanding of impartiality - even working from that minimal understanding, you think Judge Kavanaugh jeopardized any appearance of impartiality after what he said last Thursday.",
        "Yes because his tirade, his fury toward what he called the left will cause great doubt about the disinterestedness, the objectivity of decisions he makes where there are different views, divergent views on the left and the right.",
        "Finally, just stepping back from Kavanaugh for a moment, how does what we saw play out last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee - how does that affect the credibility of the Supreme Court as an institution?",

        "He was nominated for a Tony Award - the first of many - and would eventually win in 1987 for directing the August Wilson play, Fences.",
        "He helped foster the careers of many playwrights as Dean of the Yale School of Drama and Artistic Director of the Yale Repertory Theater, positions he held for more than a decade.",
