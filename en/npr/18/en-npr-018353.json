        "So upper-class Mexicans who live in Tijuana are saying they really want the caravan to leave.",

        "as often because she has a lot of medicine that she has to take, and most of that is in Tijuana.",
        "So when the border was temporarily closed on Sunday, she didn't have access to her medicine for like five hours.",

        "And - but then you have many families who are willing to wait because they're so desperate and they're terrified about the prospect of going back home, where they've received death threats, where they've had uncles and brothers and sisters killed.",

        "Ms.",
        "Parker, the Lady Vols sophomore phenom, totally dominated the game.",
        "At 6'4\"\", she has a speed of a point guard, the silky jumper of a shooting guard, the postings of a center and can dunk to boot.",
        "It's no wonder she received the Wade Trophy this year, which is given to the best women's player in the nation.",
        "That these young girls sought Ms. Parker's autograph made total sense to me.",
        "What didn't was a lone African-American boy around the age of 10 who joined the crowd of Candace Parker fans.",
        "When Ms. Parker finally came out and sat with her family, arena security dispersed most of the autograph seekers.",
        "Not to be deterred, this boy tried to sneak past the guard, but was repelled.",
        "He then sat in the vacant seat next to my friends and I, a bundle of disappointment and excitement since separating our courtside seats and Candace Parker were about 12 feet, that guard, and a section of metal railing.",
        "After spending 20 dejected minutes next to us, he started to leave.",
        "Noticing this, the thin crowd of spectators sitting around us convinced him to lean over the railing and politely ask someone who sat much closer to Candace Parker to take his ticket stub and get her autograph.",
        "I was the only person who did not join this motivational chorus.",
        "I just couldn't understand why a young boy wanted her autograph.",
        "It's not like she was Kevin Durant.",
        "Anyway, a kind woman took his stub and gave it to Ms. Parker, who promptly signed and passed it back.",
        "When this boy got it, he looked at that stub like I would have looked at tickets to the men's championship game.",
        "A few days later, I thought about this scene.",
        "I still couldn't understand why this little boy wanted Candace Parker's autograph, but I did feel guilty for not encouraging him to seek it.",
        "as long as people like me accept women's basketball only if it mimics the men's game, Title IX and other guarantees against gender discrimination win legal battles, but the one on the most important battle field - that of the mind.",
        "The worst part is I see my warped principles as progressive ones.",
        "Somehow - and admittedly, I don't know how - principles must ultimately yield to desire - the very same desire that drove that 10-year-old boy to get Candace Parker's autograph.",
        "So hopefully, instead of being silent, I'll at least encourage that desire next time it sits next to me at a women's basketball game."
