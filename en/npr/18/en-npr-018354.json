        "You compared the views of nearly 1,600 young people of different racial and ethnic groups in the study.",
        "And I understand that you found that 68 percent of blacks believe the government would do more to find a cure for AIDS if more whites were infected.",
        "Is that one of the things that we're talking about with attitudes regarding sex?",
        "That's one of the ideas here, is that, in fact, first of all, there's great cynicism, I think, about the government.",
        "So when we ask something not only about HIV and AIDS and the government's response to that, but when we ask, for example, should the government only be funding abstinence-only sex education, an overwhelming majority of young people said that that was the wrong governmental policy.",
        "They believe, in fact, that the government should be funding sex education projects and programs that give a comprehensive understanding of sex.",
        "And really, 90 percent of young people across racial identities believe that, in fact, sex education should be mandatory in schools, 70 percent, at least, believe that in fact condom should be given out in schools.",
        "So these young people are telling us that, in fact, they want kind of complete information when making sexual decisions so that they can make healthy sexual decision.",
        "They want the information, but do they understand the dangers of engaging in unprotected sex?",
        "And how does that compared to other ethnic groups?",
        "What we're finding among young people is that sex kind of serves some multiple purposes.",
        "Clearly, it's a part of the developmental process.",
        "Every young person goes through a process where in fact they engage at some level or to some extent in sex.",
        "But I think sex also works to provide a domain for young black people where they feel like they're in control and have some success.",
        "If you think about the fact that we are losing kind of good manufacturing jobs, that it's difficult for young blacks to have a good living wage jobs, that they suffer twice the unemployment, for example, that white people do, this is one of the areas, believe it or not, where they feel like they have great success, where they're in control and where they're pretty efficacious.",
        "And what I mean by that is young black people tell us that they're more able to talk to their partners about what they want to do and when they want to have sex.",
        "So they believe, in fact, that they have some control in this area.",
        "Now, the reality is that they may believe that they have control but the consequences of kind of risky sexual decision making is evident in the disproportionate numbers of African-American youth who contract HIV and suffer from AIDS.",
        "Through 2001, African-Americans accounted for nearly three quarters of the diagnosed HIV infections among 13 to 19-year-old girls and two thirds of 20 to 24-year-old women.",
        "Now have you seen any differences in the ways that black boys and black girls handle life choices when it comes to sex?",
        "In the case of an out-of-control wildfire, that's a really interesting question.",
        "I suppose they - I would not really pretend to be able to answer, you know, or make Brazilian government policy here on the air.",
        "But, I think there would probably be those in the Brazilian government who would make the case that they needed to go in and do something about it.",
        "The news keeps getting worse for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.",
        "Last month, Congress approved a rescue plan for the two mortgage giants, but since then, their stock prices have fallen and they've had to pay higher interest rates on the money they need to operate.",
        "Now, there's a lot of speculation that Fannie and Freddie may soon actually need to turn to the federal government for help.",

        "When Congress approved its extraordinary bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last month, members hoped it would be enough to reassure anxious investors.",

        "Under the terms of the bailout, the federal government agreed to pour capital into the companies if their condition deteriorated too much.",
        "Again, Bob Litan.",
        "That should have comforted the bond holders and all the debt that's been issued by both Fannie and Freddie, but nonetheless there's still some nervousness out there because the spreads on their debt have gone up.",
        "In other words, since the bailout both Fannie and Freddie have had to pay somewhat higher interest rates to attract the capital they need to operate.",
        "That's a sign investors have dwindling confidence in the companies, and that's for the best securities the companies sell, those guaranteed by the federal government.",
        "Some of their other debt has been down-graded by bond-rating agencies, and their stock prices continue to fall.",
        "Why, despite the federal government's best efforts, are investors still so scared?",
