        "Well, Connecticut and Butler, different schools, different basketball programs, but Connecticut, like Butler, has been almost overlooked in this tournament as if a Connecticut team can ever really be overlooked.",
        "Because Kemba Walker, Connecticut's player, who is going to be a very good player in the NBA, puts the team - the cliche is he puts the team on his shoulders.",
        "But since his shoulders are so tiny, it is worth pointing out.",
        "And he's great not just at scoring - and he had 20 last night - but the way he assists, the way he, you know, just makes the team work as he wants it to work, so UConn has had a tremendous streak as of late and they're in the Final Four again.",
        "You've got a few seconds.",

        "Remember, Barack Obama picked Kansas to win the entire tournament this year.",
        "And Kansas does look like the one really complete team with great players at every position.",

        "And one of the ways they do that is by aerial surveillance.",
        "So, normally these planes will fly over villages that are known to exist at a, you know, reasonably high altitude so as not to provoke or to frighten the Indians, but in this particular case, there has been pressure building.",
        "Peru, next door, has made official declarations doubting the existence of these people or - and the various tribes that are down there.",
        "I think what happened was these Brazilian officials decided that they were going to show the world that these tribes actually do exist.",
        "So, they flew down at a very obviously low altitude, low enough to frighten the Indians, and provoke them into the posture they took, pointing their bows and arrows at the plane.",
        "What is at stake here between Peru and Brazil that there would be this difference of opinion over whether these tribes exist in the first place?"

        "And I think that's a really important intervention in terms of thinking about how to change some of the data and the trends around sex that we see that many find disturbing.",
        "It will undoubtedly come from families and from churches and even from schools.",
        "Some schools are critical here, but I think we really need to build an infrastructure of teen-peer educators who can talk to other young people."
