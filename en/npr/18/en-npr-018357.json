        "OK.",
        "But the Brazilians have been much more, you know, advanced in terms of their policy.",
        "Let me ask you about that phrase, \"\"un-contacted tribes.\"\" Because are they really, completely un-contacted?",
        "I mean, you yourself went into the rainforest looking for these people, and got pretty close, although you deliberately didn't contact them.",
        "But let's talk first about that phrase.",
        "What does that mean, un-contacted?",
        "Had they really not been contacted?",
        "Well, you know, it's interesting.",
        "It depends on - there are different situations, depending on the groups.",
        "There are, probably, somewhere, perhaps, around 60 or 70 un-contacted groups in the Amazon.",
        "The majority of them are in Brazil, but Peru is - harbors probably about 15 of these groups.",
        "And the level of contact or exposure to outside society depends on which group you are talking about.",
        "In some instances, there's probably been very little or absolutely no contact with the outside world.",
        "In others, maybe a member of the tribe has ventured out, and come back or something like that.",
        "But in any instance, in all instances, what is believed to be the case is that these Indians are the descendants of survivors of violent, bloody contact with the outside world that may have dated back to the 18th or 19th or early 20th century.",
        "Their forbearers vanished into the deepest readouts of the Amazon to avoid - to survive, and these are their successive generations.",
        "Let's talk about the trip that you took.",
        "You went with a man named Sydney Possuelo, if I'm...",
        "Correct.",
        "Pronouncing that correctly.",
        "Tell us a little bit about him and what he does.",
        "Sydney Possuelo is an extraordinary person.",
        "He is a lifelong what in Brazil is called a sertanista.",
        "A sertanista is like an Amazonian scout, and they are Indian rights activists, you know, adventurers, ethnographers, wilderness scouts.",
        "And Possuelo has followed in this tradition that's been evolving in Brazil for a couple of centuries.",
        "He pioneered, within FUNAI, this Department of Isolated Indians specifically to treat and take care of un-contacted Indians.",
        "Prior to Possuelo assuming the reins of this department, the policy was generally - FUNAI's job, one of its jobs was to go into the deep jungle in advance of the frontier, in advance of, say, the Trans-Amazonian highway..."

        "Right.",
        "Or whatever the agricultural frontier.",
        "And these scouts, these woodsmen, would go in, in advance of that to make contact with, you know, un-contacted groups in order to soften the blow - maybe even move them to a new location - soften the blow of that contact with civilization.",
        "But Possuelo developed this new policy, that if we can identify where these groups are, and who they are, let's protect their land, and erect a barricade around it, basically, and let them live without contact.",
        "Yeah, it was interesting, because I think you mentioned in the course of your article that at one time when he first started, the way you made your name was to rack up as many tribes as possible that you had contacted.",
        "He contacted something, like, seven tribes, and made contact with these people.",
        "And then, he backed off and said, something's going wrong with this.",
        "Why?",
        "What was his - what did he see?",
        "What did he witness when he contact those tribes?",
        "What happened?",
        "Right, it would be a status thing among these groups...",
        "Right.",
        "To make as many first contacts as possible, you know?",
        "But what Possuelo found was, inevitably, that no matter how humanitarian the contact was - you know, how the terms of contact were made, that the Indians would inevitably succumb to epidemic disease, because these are basically virgin-soil populations.",
        "Those Indians that were photographed last month, or those photos that were released last month, they've not had contact with the outside.",
        "So, you know, one of the definitions, maybe you can make for un-contacted tribes, they do not have immunity to our common germs, influenza, measles, cold.",
        "So within weeks of first contact, their population can be decimated by these diseases.",
        "And so Possuelo saw rampant disease, the Indians, once vibrant warriors reduced to dislocated caricatures of a drunken, idol, broken, beggar.",
        "And he decided that the best thing to do was to leave these people alone, if at all possible.",
        "We're talking with Scott Wallace.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Well, Possuelo led this expedition, the man we were talking about before.",
        "One of the things that he does, and the Brazilian government does, is occasionally they will mount expeditions into the lands of some of these groups, not to make contact with them, but to basically check up on their relative well-being, to see if there's any imminent danger of infiltration from poachers, or loggers, or other intruders.",
        "And you can't - this is closed canopy jungle, so you can't do that just by aerial surveillance.",
        "You actually have to go in on the ground.",
        "And when you do go in on the ground, when you go in, you have to have a large enough contingent to, for security reasons, and it's a dangerous place.",
        "We went in there, and as you move through the forest, and this is primeval, incredible.",
        "This is an incredible place.",
        "It almost feels like walking on the bottom of the ocean, with this diffused light way up overhead, and you're moving through this, like, incredible gloom, past trees that are, like, enormous columns.",
        "And as you move deeper into this forest, you begin to find signs of these people lying around.",
        "Anybody who moves in the jungle will snap off twigs as they go around, at about hand level, as they're walking, to mark their - so they can find their way back from, you know, when they're walking in the woods.",
        "And you start seeing these little snapped-off twigs.",
        "And the guys that we're with - I was with 35 men and 20 Indians from three different tribes in that area.",
        "They're fantastic wilderness scouts and trackers.",
        "And they can see one of these signs, like a snapped twig, and instantly say, this was from two months ago."

        "Or is it a hands-off policy as far as nature goes?",
        "Interesting question.",
        "I think in the case of flood, they would probably let that go, because the Amazon routinely floods and water levels can fluctuate up to, like, 60 feet from dry season to rainy season.",

        "Thanks so much for being with us, Mr. Mazower.",
        "Well, the long and the short of it is that there are a lot of conflicting views within the Brazilian government and kind of conflicting political forces at play.",
        "So, the photos of the un-contacted Indians, you know, that made headlines a couple of weeks ago were taken by a department of the Brazilian government that is entrusted with protecting these very isolated groups.",
        "And they are mostly run by very committed individuals who are doing their best to monitor a very large, very remote area, and ensure that no outsiders go in there, if there are thought to be un-contacted or isolated Indians living there."
