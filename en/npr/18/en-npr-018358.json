        "But of course, there are a lot of other very powerful players in Brazilian society.",
        "And the cattle-ranching business and the agricultural sector are extremely well-financed and influential.",
        "And there is a very concerted lobbying effort going on right now for a lot of the reserves that the Brazilian government has created to protect the Indian population to be opened up.",
        "What about the Peruvian government?",
        "They have a completely different attitude?",
        "Well, it's funny, because in one sense, they are more progressive, because Peru has recognized for many years the rights of the tribal peoples there to actually own their lands.",
        "That is to say, they get the physical title to their lands, and no one can take that away from them.",
        "In Brazil, by contrast, Indians cannot own any land at all.",
        "And legally speaking, they're actually treated as children.",
        "They are deemed not to be able to - they don't have the kind of legal status of adults.",
        "And so because they are not allowed to own any land, and the Indian territories are merely set aside by the government, they're much more vulnerable to those - the borders of those territories being changed after lobbying.",
        "Whereas in Peru, the Indian communities can own their land, but there are very severe problems of enforcement.",
        "And the big problem in Peruvian Amazon right now in this area where - near where these isolated Indians are living is a massive wave of illegal logging, illegal mahogany logging that is sending hundreds of loggers into these very isolated areas, which are really the last places in the Amazon where mahogany is growing in any kind of quantity.",
        "And those people are coming - those loggers are coming into contact with these very isolated Indian groups.",
        "All right.",
        "We're going to take a call now, from Nick.",

        "Go ahead.",
        "Right now I'm taking a course on ancient cities and lost civilizations.",
        "And I realized there might be a scientific value in studying the human behavior of these people and just looking at their, maybe, burial rituals, religious rituals, anything like that.",
        "I was just wondering, is there any scientific value to observing these people, as unobtrusively as possible?",
        "Maybe we could learn something from them?",

        "Well, the problem with the people whose photos we saw a couple of weeks ago, of course, is that any outsider who tries to enter their territory is likely to get a very hostile reception.",
        "And that isn't due to any kind of irrationality, or superstition, or anything like that.",
        "It's because, perhaps, 100, 150 years ago, the rubber boom swept through that whole western Amazon region when European companies were set up to look for rubber, and it devastated the Indian tribes who were living there.",
        "Most people - most estimates say around 90 percent of the Indians were wiped out, and so the survivors retreated into these very remote headwaters, and it's their descendents who are the kind of people who were in the photos.",
        "So the only way such societies can be studied is by the air, and that in itself is going to be very intrusive to them and going to disturb them greatly.",
        "But I would say that there are, you know, a large number of very thriving Indian groups throughout Amazonia, and really all the countries of the Amazon.",
        "Many of them have been very well-studied by anthropologists and others.",
        "So I wouldn't say that there is anything particularly unusual about these un-contacted Indians other than the fact that they have managed to retreat into the, you know, remotest parts of the Amazon and stayed there, and have managed to, so far, kind of repel outsiders, although they have often suffered massacres themselves.",
        "But they are almost certainly living in a very similar way to neighboring tribes of whom quite a lot is known, and there are people who speak their languages and who have lived and worked with them for decades.",
        "So in general, Amazonian Indian societies are very well-known and understood, and you know, I think I would agree with your caller, in that, I think, we have a lot to learn from them, and most of us, our natural reaction, when faced with these kinds of societies who, in one way, seem so different to ours is, it's a - there's a natural fascination and a natural interest to learn more about them.",
        "Right, but Jonathan, just a - just before I let you go, your position would be that these tribes should be left alone and that there should be really a kind of coordinated effort to do that, I think.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "And it's not just because they have suffered atrocities and violence in the past, but because, as is well-known now, they are extremely vulnerable to the common cold, to influenza, these common Western diseases that for you and I might be an inconvenience, but are hardly likely to be fatal, and for isolated Amazonian societies who have no immunity, no antibodies to these kinds of diseases, they can be absolutely devastating.",
        "So we would say for their own sake they should be left alone.",
        "They have the right to be left alone.",
        "And as long as their territory is protected, then, you know, leave them be and let them make their own choices about when and how they interact with the outside world.",
        "Let that be up to them.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks so much for joining us, Jonathan.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Jonathan Mazower is the campaigns coordinator for Survival International, an organization that supports tribal people, and he joined us from his home in England.",

        "I don't know what the level of contact that was reached with these tribes, but has there been any attempt to discern their language or to discern what level of sophistication their language has been reached, as has been done with some of the last un-contacted tribes of Papua New Guinea?",
        "Well, you know, it depends on which group you're talking about, because there are areas in the Amazon where it is known that, you know, certain isolated groups are actually part of a tribe that separated and went their separate ways earlier on.",
        "For example, in Ecuador, one of the un-contacted groups in Ecuador is actually a splinter group of the Huaorani.",
        "The Huaorani, they made contact, they accepted contact and were basically brought into, you know, Ecuadoran society and the outside world, by American missionaries, in many instances.",
        "And their - part of their tribe decided that they did not want that kind of exposure to the outside world, and they - they retreated into the deeper jungle.",
        "So, in some instances, it's well-known what the languages are that they speak, and the same is true in Peru, and some of the isolated groups are actually splinter groups of other tribes who have had contact with the outside.",
        "But in some instances, it's not known at all what language they speak or what they call themselves or, you know, those kinds of details are unknown and remain a mystery.",
        "And Sydney Possuelo, who took me into that area, took us into that area, whom I accompanied into that area, says, you know, I don't need to know those things.",
        "I don't really care what language they speak or what gods they worship or what ethnic group they belong to.",

        "Hi.",
        "I just had a question.",
        "How do you respond to the question of why haven't these tribes technologically evolved?",
        "I mean, they're basically, you know, at least 1,000 or more years behind of - basically all the rest of the world, and how would you respond to that question of why don't they evolve?",
        "Are they...",
        "That's a - that's a great question, and I think to actually view - to presume that we understand what their level of evolving, of evolvement or evolution is, I think, is a little bit of a conceit.",
        "After all, these people are perfectly adapted to the rainforest.",
        "They understand how to live in one of the most inhospitable environments in the world.",
        "They have evolved agriculture.",
        "They have tools.",
        "They have weapons.",
        "They know how to function in that environment.",
        "And in fact, the West, we who are so technologically advanced, we westerners still do not know how to develop the Amazon without destroying it.",
        "And those people have lived in there for thousands of years, basically in harmony with the environment.",
        "So, you know, for - that's just one little way of looking at that question.",
        "But also I think it's really interesting to note that, you know, they don't have a lot of the things that we have, and perhaps it's because they didn't have the domesticated animals.",
        "They lived in a harsh environment, so they haven't been able to accumulate large surpluses and wealth, and the kinds of things that are basically the underpinnings of big civilizations, where you generate a surplus, and the wealth that's required for a division of labor, and all the things that you can accomplish in that kind of complicated civilization.",
        "So anyway, fantastic question.",
        "Thanks for the call.",
        "Scott, we're almost out of time, but do you think it's realistic to think these tribes can be left alone, that they won't be contacted?",
        "I think that we can try to - we can do what we can to try to keep it from happening.",
        "I think, you know, as Jonathan was saying from England, that it's very important that we try to protect these people as much as possible and keep people out of there.",
        "And let these people decide when they want to make contact with the outside world."
