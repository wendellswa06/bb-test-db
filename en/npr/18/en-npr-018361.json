        "I think there's a lot of contemptuousness toward religion from many of the atheists.",

        "And as Neal can well tell you, you gain a lot of knowledge, fortunately, in this line of work.",
        "But the truth of the matter is, there are many people who go through the experience that you went through - see war firsthand, see good men die, and they begin to question their faith or essentially what was fed to them in the way of belief.",
        "And I make the distinction, of course, between faith and belief.",
        "I think these are questions that need to be grappled with, but you can believe in perhaps a prime mover.",

        "Don't they realize that most of our founding fathers were deists?",

        "I must say, though, that there is a sense that I get from that caller's questioning that he wants to find out why, why there's so much dogmatism.",
        "And a lot of the reaction of the - what we're calling like, people like Bill Maher, I think, was the hypocrisy of religion, was people that they saw as enemies like Jerry Falwell, and the Bush administration's evangelicalism, and so forth.",
