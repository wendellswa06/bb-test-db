        "And so what you want to do is copy it on to a CD or a DVD, knowing then in 10 years you're probably going to have to reduplicate it again on to the latest technology because CDs, in and of themselves, and DVDs may last an incredibly long time.",

        "The whole culture of war - as a non-American, I think the American experience of cocaine has been unlike any other country.",
        "And America was the first country in, you know, in - since the Second World War to have mass abuse of cocaine.",
        "And that followed on from a time when America generally was very laissez-faire with cocaine at the end of 1970s.",
        "So I think there was a real swing.",

        "Right.",
        "That laissez-faire period was at a time when people -official people thought, this is not a addictive.",
        "It's not really a problem.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I think people have been trying to make up for lost ground ever since.",
        "Well, part of that was - in any case, the analogy you draw in the beginning of the book - really, there were a lot of them.",
        "But the biggest one is to Prohibition, the experience of trying to ban alcohol back in the late teens and the early '20s.",
        "Well, yes, that was, I think - the last time that the murder rate that we saw in the mid-'80s in the States, when the war on drugs was at its height and the crack cocaine economy was at its height, the last time America saw that kind of murder rate was during the alcohol prohibition period.",
        "So there certainly are parallels in terms of the violence and corruption that went with banning alcohol.",
        "We saw the same thing with cocaine.",
        "And there's a lot of interesting parallels, too, about how consumption changed when alcohol consumption was made legal again.",
        "At least in most places.",
        "And, indeed, that it took a long while, but eventually it rebounded back to the levels before the - before Prohibition.",
        "But a lot of people would say, you know, we have a lot of problems with alcohol, too.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "But I don't think - no one would suggest that we make alcohol or tobacco illegal.",
        "There are lots of things that need to be done to reduce the harm done - mainly, effective treatment, education.",
        "But criminalizing it would be counterproductive.",
        "Now, I've argued in the book that perhaps we should use the way - same way of thinking with illegal drugs like cocaine, and be ready to admit the huge problems caused by criminalizing it.",
        "There's a story you tell about Kurt Schmoke, the former mayor of Baltimore, who was - eventually came to the conclusion that legalizing drugs, or decriminalizing them, would be the best approach.",
        "And he was brought out to a discussion where he realized that he was heavily outnumbered and turned to his audience and said, if your daughter - if you found your daughter had a major problem with cocaine, who would you call?",
        "Would you call a doctor, or would you call the police?",
        "Yes, yeah.",
        "I mean, it was very interesting talking to Kurt Schmoke about his experience as mayor of Baltimore.",
        "And I think one of the things that, you know, that he pointed out was the fact that there is an exoticism.",
        "There is something strange and unusual about cocaine, so people are inclined to think of it in different terms to alcohol.",
        "Whereas, when you think about peoples attitude to alcohol, we acknowledge on the one hand that yes, it blights and destroys a lot of people's lives.",
        "The actual number of people who become dependent on alcohol, percentage-wise, is quite similar to the number of people who become dependent on cocaine.",
        "But we, at least, are able to acknowledge that usually if that person is alcohol dependent, they have underlying psychological issues that need to be addressed.",
        "We dont say, let's ban this crazy substance.",
        "Let's get some callers in on the conversation.",

        "And I have to say, I am in total agreement with your guest based on what I've heard thus far.",
        "It's been my experience that, particularly in America, drugs - most drug cases give you a felony on your record.",
        "And then the problem is, you try and go back to your community and find work, and you have to put down on any job application whether youre a convicted felon.",
        "And so it becomes this cycle, where people who have a drug problem kind of end up stuck in that way of life, or in the system, because theyre unable to get the help that they need because they're stigmatized with the felony on their record.",
        "And of course, these people don't stop having children in the meantime, and life goes on.",
        "And so, now we have children being raised in families that are not, probably, the most stable, and those children are harmed by it.",
        "So, in all, the best way to handle drugs from a legal perspective is to legalize them and treat them like cigarettes.",
        "These people are addicts.",
        "They belong in a hospital.",
        "They don't belong in a prison.",
        "And that's not to mention the expense and time and the clogging of the judicial system with drug cases.",

        "Appreciate it.",
        "And Tom Feiling, as I think you put it in the book, people's addictions can be treated; felony convictions cannot.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "And - I mean, I couldn't have really have put it better myself, what Joe just said.",
        "I think talking to a lot of people when I was in the States, there are more and more people working in the judiciary and in law enforcement who are getting tired of the sheer -how counterproductive and ineffective and expensive all of this is."
