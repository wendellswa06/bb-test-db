        "But the actual users at the other end, instead of sending them to jail and so on, we start diverting them into medical facilities, which I certainly agree with.",
        "But I think there is a bigger picture to acknowledge, which is if you don't legalize it, if the production and distribution remains in the hands of criminals, you still have the terrible violence and corruption that we're seeing all the time in Mexico, in Brazil, in Jamaica, in Colombia - in all the regions, from where it's produced to where it's consumed.",

        "Well, it's a gateway drug because you're having to go to a drug dealer's house to buy it.",
        "And that drug dealer probably doesn't just sell pot.",
        "He sells cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, prescription pills, whatever else.",
        "So you're around those other things.",
        "If you go to a coffee shop like you do in Amsterdam, and they don't have those other drugs, then you can't buy those other drugs, and you may never meet those people and go in their house.",
        "As far as the cocaine goes, the guy who wrote the book and the attorney are exactly right.",
        "They need to decriminalize it, regulate it, tax the hell out of it, make money off it.",

        "Yes, everything would fall into the same logic.",
        "And I can understand everyone - you know, the people's eyebrows will be shooting up over the top of their heads when I say this.",
        "But I think, you know, when you look at other dangerous - potentially dangerous activities, it is precisely because they're dangerous that we regulate them.",
        "We bring them in, to send it out into - to criminalize these activities worsens the situation.",
        "It's precisely the danger involved, the potential danger of drugs like cocaine and heroin, which means that you'd be much better off having a legal, regulated source which, as your last contributor said, was taxed and money went into effective treatment and education about those potential dangers.",
