        "Now, the New York Times report that described your resignation in 1995 said that sources at the time said you had aroused opposition with your, quote, \"\"emphasis on reshaping Planned Parenthood into a broad health organization that could compete in the era of managed care\"\" - a focus that some of the group's affiliates felt would inevitably diminish their role as advocates for abortion rights and low-income women's access to health care."
