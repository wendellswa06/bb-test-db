        "Alan Rabinowitz, you have studied jaguars.",
        "Tell us how you track one?",
        "Well, there are several ways of tracking it.",
        "The most basic way, of course, is finding - getting on to one of its actual footprints in the jungle or to find sign - its scrapes, its markings - and then just follow it."

        "I'll only do that if it's a very, very fresh track because otherwise it makes no sense, and I'll stay on it for as long as I can.",
        "But often, as you've mentioned earlier in the opening, well, whenever I try to track a jaguar that way, I often find it has circled around and is tracking me.",
        "Do you have an experience you could describe for us?",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "I have a very vivid experience.",
        "I was actually tracking - I was on one of the freshest tracks I'd ever encountered to where the dirt was actually still breaking inside of the track, so I knew the jaguar was just up ahead of me in the jungles of Belize.",
        "And I got onto it, it was a big male I hadn't seen before in that area, and I was on it pretty quickly.",
        "And after several - as usual, it stayed ahead of me.",
        "I couldn't get to it.",
        "I was hoping I'd find it, catch up with it or find it over kill.",
        "After several hours, it was getting dark and I had to get back to the camp because I didn't have a flashlight, so I turn around and there was the jaguar probably no more than 15 feet in back of me and it had been step - it had been walking in my tracks.",
        "It was the same jaguar which I later confirm by coming back the next day and backtracking it.",
        "But it had circled around and for quite a distance while I thought I was tracking it with my head down and my body kneeling, it had been just right in back of me, right in back of me.",
        "And I faced it, and my first impulse, actually, was to make myself small.",
        "So I crouched down, became not at all a dominant-looking figure, hoping the jaguar was thinking the jaguar would walk off into the forest.",
        "And the jaguar just sat down.",
        "I crouched down, it sat down and we just looked at one another for, I don't know 25, 30 seconds.",
        "And I started getting a bit nervous, realizing that there was not a lot of alternatives here.",
        "And I stood up, stepped back and the jaguar jumped up, just let out a fairly quiet growl and then just walked off into the forest.",
        "Wow.",
        "Frans, anything like that happened to you at all?",
        "No.",
        "I haven't worked with jaguars, but, you know, I can well imagine being in that position because I have worked with big cats elsewhere.",
        "And, you know, there are situations where you have to act on instinct.",
        "And it's a really interesting thing what happens to you when you work up closely with animals, you know?",
        "Rationality is often replaced by thinking through your feet or thinking through your skin.",

        "Sure.",
        "Alan, did you ever track a jaguar by smell, by its marking?",
        "I try.",
        "It's very difficult in the rainforest for me to do that, being lesser of an animal than the jaguars are.",
        "I could - when the smells are very fresh, when the anal scent is fresh or the urine is very fresh, I can get on them.",
        "But it never, it would - I would often use that only to lead me to tracks and things I could follow.",
        "I could never really follow them just by scent.",
        "And maybe it was me and somebody could do better, but I could never stay on them very long with scent alone.",

        "But when I went to the Congo basin in the early 1990s on assignment for National Geographic, there were very few photographs of bonobos in the wild and very few people, you know, knew how to appreciate them.",
        "That was a grueling undertaking which I carried out with a Japanese scientist, Dr. Kano(ph), who is, at that time, the only scientist who had consistent direct observations of bonobos.",

        "Oh, there's no question about it.",
        "Each period of the day or night - in each period of the day or night, the forest responds differently to sound.",
        "For instance, during the day, it tends to be a little bit drier so the sound doesn't reverberate as much.",
        "And at night, it's very reverberant.",
        "And the critters that love echo, of course, vocalize at night.",

        "Yeah.",
        "It's very dense and there's a lot of diversity.",
        "And what's interesting is that each of these critters is partitioning so that they'll all have these channels in which they transmit their vocalization.",
        "It's like television channels - some insects are on channel 4, birds are on channel 2, the mammals are on channel 1 and so on.",
        "Oh, quite an…",
        "They not only have these frequency channels but they also have temporal channels in which they vocalize so this partitioning is very, very articulate in particularly in tropical rainforests.",
        "All right.",
