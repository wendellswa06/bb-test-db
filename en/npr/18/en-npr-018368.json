        "Yes, it often does.",

        "Do any of you ever use staged photos?",
        "There was a controversy, a scandal many years ago about wildlife photography and people staging the photos to make them think that it was actually happening in the wild.",

        "We know that elephants communicate at a frequency that we cannot hear, and we know the mice communicate at a frequency that we can't hear.",
        "I'm wondering if the scientists have looked for frequencies that we humans can't hear in the jungle or the rainforest.",
        "Good question.",
        "And Bernie, Alan, any of the…",
        "We actually have done that.",
        "It was - scientists have been doing that.",
        "The elephant work actually brought it out a bit a lot more, and we started testing a lot of other species.",
        "But since I was in graduate school, working on black bears in their hibernating dens, we used to test for different sounds, the ultrasonic sounds and other things.",
        "And what we have been finding is that there are - usually, more often than not, there are sounds on other levels, beyond human hearing.",
        "What we don't know as much is what these other sounds mean.",
        "We haven't figured that out.",
        "But almost every species we have tested does produce sounds at other levels other than what we can hear.",
        "And I don't know if Bernie has tested that or found the same thing.",
        "Yes, I have, Alan.",
        "And as a matter of fact, what's interesting about this is at the highest and lowest vocalizations are in the cetacean group.",
        "The highest is the (unintelligible) Ganges dolphin, up at 356 kilohertz, if you can believe.",
        "And the lowest is probably a right whale, down around 3 hertz.",
        "So you've got that range all in the cetaceans, the whales."

        "We're actually being filmed by National Geographic when this occurred.",
        "And the - we had dropped the microphone just on top of the ant hole and the ants were communicating to one another, not by pheromone, which is typically what we think about, which is the scent of - that ant's put out, but by sound.",

        "It's too loud actually here on the radio, but it's powerful.",
        "We're talking about wild sounds this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "I once - when I was in Antarctic almost 30 years ago, I climbed up on a little - tongue of a glacier and put my microphone on the ice to hear it melting, and I just heard a little tinkling of water as it was melting through the glacier.",

        "Oh, really?",
