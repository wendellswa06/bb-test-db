        "Well, it is interesting because people often ask how do you discover a new species.",
        "And it's kind of the scientist's dream to do so.",
        "And it's strange how you end up doing it these days.",
        "Because most of the new discoveries that have been occurring, at least of mammals, have often been from dead animals - from animal parts from going into villages or in local marketplaces and seeing what people - local people are selling or using or tacking up to their walls in remote areas.",
        "So I was just doing a wildlife survey way up in northern Myanmar by the Tibet border and it had taken us about two months to walk into this one particular village.",
        "And I walked into a hut of a hunter and up on the wall was what he called a trophy wall - a trophy board of all of his - the skulls of all the kills that he'd made because they believe that if they hang the skull, that they will have better luck hunting that particular species.",
        "And I realized there was a skull up there which looked clearly like a barking deer skull, but it didn't look like a barking deer skull.",
        "It had fangs, it had long canine teeth unlike any -much longer than any barking deer I had seen.",
        "And there was also part of the head, which had tiny little antlers.",
        "So the local people immediately told me that it was - that it was a different kind of deer.",
        "They knew - I showed them pictures of what exists, what we know…",
        "All right, Alan, hang on to the story.",
        "It's a great tale.",
        "As always, we have to interrupt these good ones.",
        "So we'll come back after the break and hear more about the discovery of this new deer.",
        "Stay with us, we'll be right back.",

        "Yes, it is.",

        "We found those - we found a piece of skull unlike any I had ever seen before.",
        "The local people said it was a different kind of deer that only grew to be about two feet tall with tiny little antlers no more than an inch tall, and large fangs.",
        "I brought the skull back with some pieces of hair that I found, and genetically it proved to be the most - it was a completely new species and it was genetically the most primitive deer known in the entire world.",
        "So I went back next - the next year to that site and started paying hunters not to kill the deer, which they were doing, but to - but I would pay them double if they brought it to me alive.",
        "And I had started having hunters bring me this live tiny deer and it turned out to be a living fossil.",
        "It's a no known living deer is a frugavore - eats fruits.",
        "This deer is a solitary deer species that eats only fruits and has large fangs and tiny antlers.",
        "This was a throwback.",
        "It was kind of the missing link between extinct species and living species.",
        "Are we going to see this deer find a home in the Bronx Zoo anytime soon?",
        "No, I didn't want to bring it back to any - we actually brought a live specimen - two live specimens back to the Yangon Zoo in Burma and took care of them, but unfortunately, they died.",
