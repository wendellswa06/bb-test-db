        "You know, much of biology is happening in labs these days.",
        "And I think it's important that there are these people, these individuals - no matter whether your medium is sound, or photography, or science, or books - to convey a more direct sense that is scientifically accurate, but that is rooted in personal experience, what it's like to be out there in this different realm that very few of us experience directly anymore.",
        "All three of you, do you feel now that we keep hearing about dwindling ecosystems and losses of species, that it's your mission to go out and capture them before they're gone or to create some noise about them?",
        "I think…",
        "Well, it certainly…",
        "Yeah, go ahead.",
        "My entire - I started the division called science and exploration at the Bronx Zoo, at the Wildlife Conservation Society.",
        "And the whole purpose of it was to try to find and explore the Earth's remaining wild places and wild landscapes.",
        "And through science, to try to not just document what's there, but to try to save that.",
        "That's my entire passion in life.",
        "I do it - different people do it in different ways.",
        "I do it using the large cats.",
        "Because through the large cats, which everybody feels a strong affinity for, we can - it's not really about saving that particular species by itself.",
        "It's about saving very large landscapes, over which the big cat roams.",
        "Well, in that vein, let's listen to a sound that we have from Bernie who supplied us with a really interesting logging comparison, the sounds of before logging and after logging.",
