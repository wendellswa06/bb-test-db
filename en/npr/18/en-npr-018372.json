        "Certainly was a dramatic show in Singapore.",
        "Let me ask about another thing that was happening at the same time though, Kelsey, because lawmakers have been discussing immigration and what, if anything, they can try to vote on that President Trump might sign.",
        "Have they made any progress?",
        "Late yesterday evening, Republican leaders in the House announced that they had an agreement to forgo this whole conversation we've been having about overthrowing leadership's judgment and needing to have a vote on a very, I guess, moderate bill working with Democrats to pass the DREAM Act.",
        "Oh, there was a discharge petition to...",
        "Right.",
        "So - yeah, which is basically a sense that the Republicans wanted to vote on something - or a small set of Republicans wanted to vote on something leaders wouldn't allow.",
        "They would have forced their leaders to do it.",
        "They fell two votes short.",
        "Oh.",
        "So the signatures did not - they did not reach their goal.",
        "Instead, leaders reached this agreement to have a vote on two bills, one that would largely match the four pillars that President Trump laid out outlining security and cutting back on immigration and then something a little bit more moderate - because the message that leaders sent to most of their members was, it would be demoralizing to their base and frustrating for them to vote on something that would get Democrats votes.",
        "They didn't want to pass an immigration bill out of the Republican-controlled Congress on mostly Democratic votes.",
        "OK.",
        "So as far as that discharge petition goes, never mind.",
        "Kelsey, thanks very much."

        "So they are still letting migrants in, but it seems that they're only letting in Italian maritime vessels as opposed to foreign country NGOs.",
        "And it's also important to note that Italy has been dealing with the bulk of the immigration crisis seen in Europe since 2014.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They've seen hundreds of thousands of migrants arrive, usually crossing from Libya.",
        "And so in the last few years, Italy has been doing a lot of kind of questionable things to deal with immigration, like making controversial deals with Libya to intercept migrants.",
        "It's been documented that a lot of the migrants that are sent back to Libya in detention centers there are experiencing human rights violations like slavery and torture.",

        "Very briefly, then, why is Spain saying yes when so many other countries are saying no?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So Spain actually has also had a change of government.",
        "And the new government is socialist, pro-European, pro-immigration and feminist.",
        "And so this is kind of their first chance to portray this image of themselves.",
        "And, you know, there's no concern as of yet about taking in too many refugees in Spain because Spain hasn't taken that many refugees in in the past.",
        "And in fact, they've been criticized for that."
