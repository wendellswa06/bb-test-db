        "Now, this week, in a letter explaining her ouster from Planned Parenthood, Dr. Leana Wen said she had come to the organization to work on a broad range of health care issues but that, quote, \"\"the new board leadership has determined that the priority of Planned Parenthood moving forward is to double down on abortion rights advocacy.\"\" She's also said in an op-ed for The New York Times that she wanted to depoliticize abortion but that her approach seemed at odds with the direction the board wanted to go.",
        "What does this say about the trajectory of not just Planned Parenthood but also the abortion rights movement?",
        "Certainly everybody would agree that reproductive rights are hanging the balance right now.",
        "It's a tough time, and there are two schools of thought.",
        "I think that the leadership at Planned Parenthood has to do what it thinks is right.",
        "I don't think there's a right or wrong.",
        "For my part, I would do what I did, you know, last time around.",
        "I think that when you look at the number of young people and poor women in the country that don't have adequate health care, and you look at not the polarity in the debate but what women need on a day-to-day basis, it's really rare that poor women have just one problem.",
        "It's always accompanied by depression or hypertension or diabetes.",
        "So a public health physician who is a commissioner of health like Dr. Wen is going to see the world through that lens.",
        "I mean, she took an oath to do that.",
        "And similarly for a nurse, someone like me, you see the world in terms of health care delivery.",
        "I think there is an argument to be made that the president of Planned Parenthood has to be strong in the advocacy arena right now when the media is so ever-present in all of our social issues - and certainly abortion's at the top of that list.",
        "I think you have to be a strong advocate for reproductive rights, there's no question about it - reproductive control and privacy, as Justice Ginsburg recently said.",
        "So we have to speak up and make sure that line in the sand is maintained, especially now with the Supreme Court having the constitution it has."

        "On the other hand, you could argue that, strategically, moving in the direction of broader health care will mitigate against, will, you know, help fight that fight in a much more integrated way, in a way that's much more - that the American people would be receptive to.",
        "And you talk about these two schools of thought, about how political to be versus how focused on health care, at least in terms of messaging.",
        "Is that a split that's always been there within Planned Parenthood?",
        "Or is it just an old issue that was kind of dormant and has resurfaced, do you think?",
        "I would say that your quote in the beginning was accurate.",
        "It's resurfaced because I think they hired a physician.",
        "But it's always dormant.",
        "And the fact is, their instincts were right, I believe, to hire a physician, a public health physician, because at the end of the day, if it weren't a health care delivery network, they would be NARAL.",
        "And there is a great deal of credibility because Planned Parenthood does deliver other health services and an array of health services like, you know, prenatal care and pap tests and breast cancer screening and immunizations.",
        "Planned Parenthood has always provided a wide array of health care services.",
        "And so they can't be de-emphasized It's got to be based on women's health and what they need.",

        "Right.",
        "How do you think the mission of Planned Parenthood is and should be different from a group like NARAL and some of the others that do similar work?",
        "I think that's the point.",
        "Planned Parenthood delivers a wide array of services.",
        "And I think that - not that they don't want to be good, strong voices and advocates for reproductive rights.",
        "I think, though, that there's got to be a parallel concern about the health care of women in general and the services they deliver.",
        "So I had women come up to me and say, you're so concerned about whether I'm going to have another baby or not.",
        "Why don't you be more concerned about my prenatal care or the adequate, you know, nutrition?",
        "And I say, as a matter of fact, I am, and we are.",
        "Dr. Wen's departure after less than a year at Planned Parenthood came in a week when the Trump administration said it would start enforcing federal family planning rules that in effect cut a substantial amount of funding to Planned Parenthood.",
        "Right.",
        "You know, given that kind of landscape, how much of a role should the organization play, though, in lobbying against these kinds of policies that directly affect their health care mission?"

        "I'm not sure that Dr. Wen couldn't have been that.",
        "I'm sure she understood that there - I don't know this for a fact, but I can't imagine that she was hired and knew the organization and didn't understand that there was a strong role for - to speak up in the - in advocacy forums all over the country.",

        "As these issues continue to be debated in the public sphere, would you like to see a return by Planned Parenthood and other advocates to that kind of framing of this issue?",
        "Yes, Sarah, I would - and reason being that I think with any medical procedure, any surgical procedure, the watchword should be prevention.",
        "I think the best practice is to try and prevent the thing in the first place.",

        "Yeah.",
        "What it does - see, as the seasons change, it becomes harder and harder to operate this vehicle, because the sun starts to sink low in the sky.",
        "And we were fearful, if we had a dirty rover, that we'd only have a short period of time to try to solve this problem before winter came upon us and we'd lose the vehicle.",
        "Right.",

        "But Endeavor is a huge crater.",
        "Its rim, we know by looking at it from orbit, is made of stuff completely different, from everything Opportunity has seen before and indeed from anything that Spirit had seen.",
        "So if we can get there - and it's probably going to take us a couple of years, if we're going to pull this off - but if we can get there, it's going to be like a whole new mission.",
        "Oh, no kidding.",
        "You mean the rock is that different?",
        "It's completely different.",
        "It looks - from orbit, it looks - its spectral properties, its topography just looked dramatically different from anything we've ever seen.",
