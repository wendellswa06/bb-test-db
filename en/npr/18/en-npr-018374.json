        "So it's really exciting.",
        "You published and reported it in Science about water.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's right.",
        "What was the essence of that report?",
        "Well, to understand the essence of the paper that we just published, you got to go back several years to our exploration of a crater we called Endurance Crater.",
        "Endurance was the first big crater that Opportunity visited.",
        "And there, as we explored down into the crater, we got sort of a vertical slice through the rocks at that place, we found beneath the surface evidence that water had interacted with these rocks, had changed their texture, changed their chemistry, and so forth.",
        "This is ground water.",
        "This isn't like the water you would swim in.",
        "It's like water you would draw from a well.",
        "But it was water beneath the surface, and it affected these rocks."

        "And what we didn't know, what we couldn't know, was - was this just a local phenomenon, was this - you know, this happened in this one place, but elsewhere it was different?",
        "Or was this something that was regional in scope?",
        "The plains that Opportunity is exploring cover and area the size of the state of Oklahoma.",
        "And you know, is the whole area like this?",
        "Or is this just a little local, you know, you know, outlier?",
        "Right.",
        "So what we did was we then drove four miles, six kilometers to the south, to Victoria crater; it took us 21 months.",
        "It was a long, long arduous drive.",
        "And then when we got to Victoria, we spent two years there exploring along the rim, going down into the crater, doing the same kind of things that we had done in Endurance, although Victoria is a much bigger crater.",
        "And what we found was that the same general sorts of patterns that we saw six kilometers to the north were repeated here.",
        "And what that's telling us is that this was not some little local anomaly.",
        "This in fact is something that probably affected this entire region.",
        "(Singing) Saw things I imagined, I saw things...",
        "Well, the thing about Endeavor - this is - what makes Endeavor exciting is that it is actually not a crater that's formed in these sedimentary rocks that we've been exploring for five years.",
        "It actually is formed in the rock that is underneath the sediments.",
        "And then the rim of Endeavor is sticking up through those sediments like an island, a sea of sediments around it.",
        "And so it's a chance to actually see the older rocks that have - laying underneath where we've been driving for five and a half years now and know what lies beneath, which might be related to how these sediments formed in the first place.",
        "So it's a completely different rock type.",
        "It's nothing that we've been seen before.",
        "Is it a straight shot there?",
        "Any obstacles?",
        "It pretty much is a straight shot.",
        "It's not an easy straight shot because there's lots of sand dunes and obstacles.",
        "It's kind of like negotiating a maze when you drive through this stuff.",
        "The good thing is we have pictures from orbit taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft that is so high-resolution that it provides us with the map of the maze, and so we can find our way through it.",
        "And we use these pictures every day to negotiate our route.",
        "But if you have those Martian rover sand traps in the way - in between…",
        "Fortunately, those don't seem to exist at the Opportunity site.",
        "Those only seem to exist at the Spirit site and really only in the part of the Spirit site that we're in right now."

        "There definitely is.",
        "Yes, there is.",
        "Have they tried like a bulldozer does and you, you know, make the shape of an A and you press the robot arm down in the sand and push the cab of the robot out of the sand trap?",
        "Or the salt trap?",
        "We have a long…",

        "We have a long list - we have a long list of tricks that we might try.",
        "And that's one of the things on the list.",
        "Now, that arm was not designed for that job.",
        "And so if you're going to try to have things like that, you want to be very careful about how you do it.",
        "But that is indeed on our list of tricks to try if we need to."

        "We'll keep doing it until we get out or it's clear that we can't get out.",
        "One of the two.",
        "But there are many, many things that we can try, and we're really just beginning to work our process there.",
        "Well, as the winter comes, will the soil get any different in consistency that you could say, hey, let's wait, maybe it'll harden up, it will freeze a little more and not be able to get out then?",
        "We've thought about that one a little bit.",
        "I think probably a more, if you wanted to count on cold temperatures to change the properties of the soil, I think the thing to do would be to try to drive at night.",
        "It gets really cold at night on Mars and the soil properties may change a little bit at night.",
        "We've talked about that one too.",
        "Are you able to do that?",
        "Yeah, because now we got the power to do it."

        "Instead of using a solar power source, it has a nuclear power source.",
        "You've got a steady supply of electrical power, independent of dust accumulating on the vehicle.",
        "And it's also got some really cool scientific instruments, including an instrument that is going to be able to search for very, very trace abundances of organic molecules in the Martian rocks."
