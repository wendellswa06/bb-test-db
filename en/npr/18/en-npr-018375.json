        "So it's going to have more of a laboratory on board.",
        "Yeah, it's got sort of a laboratory onboard, that's why it's called the Mars Science Laboratory.",
        "There you go.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I cleared that up.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Yup.",
        "And now, that's not going to bounce to the surface.",
        "Is that going to go down by parachute?",
        "It uses parachute, just as we did.",
        "But then the final descent, as you say, does not use airbags like we did.",
        "Uses a technique called a sky crane, where - there are sort of two parts of the vehicle.",
        "There's an upper portion that has rocket motors that helps the vehicles descend together towards the surface, and then suspended below that, like it's hanging on a crane, is the rover.",
        "And when the rover touches down, you cut the cable and the other vehicle flies away and the rover's sitting there ready to go.",
        "Can you explain to yourself why the rovers have lasted so much longer?",
        "They were made for a few months and now they're, what, almost five years, something like that?",
        "Yes.",
        "It's been a combination of three things, I think, Ira.",
        "One is that we build good hardware, and we're proud of that.",
        "You know, if you're going to accuse of over-engineering, I think we'll plead guilty as charged.",
        "We feel good about that.",
        "You know, the second reason is the wind gusts.",
        "We did not count on those, we did not expect them.",
        "And yet these wind gusts have continuously cleaned off both vehicles and given us a new lease on life.",
        "The other thing is a trick that we've learned, and that is when it gets to be winter time, when the sun goes low in the northern sky, from where the Spirit rover is located, we can drive the rover onto a north-facing slope, tilt the solar rays towards the sun and get enough power to survive the winter.",
        "We've used that trick three winters in a row now.",
        "So it's been a combination of those three things.",
        "Of course the Phoenix lander just sat there and died over the winter.",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "But to be fair, Phoenix was very close to the North Pole.",
        "Right.",
        "The North Pole of Mars is a horrible place in the winter time.",
        "The sun goes away.",
        "It goes completely dark.",
        "Temperature drops to 120 degrees below zero.",
        "The vehicle becomes encased in a blanket of carbon dioxide snow.",
        "It's not place to be."

        "We're in a much more friendly part of Mars.",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "And assuming you can get the rover out of the sand, where would it head to next?",
        "What would you have it do?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Spirit - we're hoping to head for, there's a very strange feature a couple hundred meters to the south of us that we've named Goddard(ph).",
        "It's a hole in the ground.",
        "It's a pit.",
        "But it's not circular.",
        "This thing is not an impact crater, it's something else.",
        "And you know, in this area where Spirit has been exploring, we've seen a lot of evidence for volcanic activity and for hydrothermal activity, for hot rocks interacting with water.",
        "And we think this pit may be a volcanic explosion crater, which is something nobody had ever seen on March before.",
        "And so we're going to head for that and explore it and see what we can learn about both volcanic processes and water processes that have operated at this site.",
        "How far away would that be?",
        "A couple hundred meters, pretty close.",
        "But you know…",
        "I take…",
        "So close and yet so far.",
        "I mean, we've still got to get out of the sand first, right?",
        "Well, let's say you get out of the sand.",

        "You know, at some point you've done the easy stuff, okay, and you've discovered what you can by doing the things that you're doing and you've got a choice.",
        "You can either try to just do the safe stuff, do the easy stuff, preserve the vehicle, or you can try to push the envelope a little bit, try hard things and you know, take some risk in the process.",
        "They're named the Mars exploration rovers, okay?",
        "Exploration is part of the name.",
        "And we feel an obligation, you know, now that we've done the easy stuff and some of the kind of hard stuff to try doing the really hard stuff.",

        "Well, good luck to you.",
        "Sounds exciting.",
        "And that's going to be a long trip to the other side of the…",
        "Yeah.",

        "More than that.",
        "More than that.",
        "How far exactly?",
