        "Later in the program, former State Department official Richard Haass - now the president of the Council on Foreign Relations - joins us on the Opinion Page to argue for policies to contain rather than eliminate terrorism, and to begin by dropping the metaphor about the war on terrorism.",
        "But first, the war between Israel and Hezbollah.",

        "Who lost?",

        "Thank you very much for having me on.",
        "So who were the winners in this conflict?",
        "Well, this is a war with two losers: Israel and Hezbollah.",
        "And both of them needed to be bailed out.",
        "Just the fact that they both needed to be bailed out makes them really losers.",
        "And no matter how much they want to spin it, either Hassan Nasrallah or Ehud Olmert - they can spin it as they wish, but this is a war that is without a clear victory or defeat.",
        "Yet Hassan Nasrallah emerges - a lot of people said if he could just emerge whole after this conflict with Israel, in affect, he won.",
        "Well, you can say that.",
        "As I said, anybody could spin it one way or another.",
        "But in the final analysis, if this resolution is implemented, Hassan Nasrallah would have to give up his weapons and he would have to be no more a state within a state.",
        "So that - in that sense, he had lost a very logic of his existence, if you will.",
        "It's an existentialist decision that has to be made now.",
        "And it had to take a war.",
        "A war later that destroyed Lebanon.",
        "So I'm not so sure I would call that a victory, a clear victory.",
        "Even when we hear that the Arab public has been very much into Hezbollah, I feel that when it's all done, people are going to look at the losses - at the destruction of the country - and they going to say, well, now what?",

        "Mm hmm.",
        "Nasrallah - in the speech that was broadcast just an hour ago or so - said that this is not the time to discuss disarming Hezbollah.",
        "Even if it is time to discuss arming Hezbollah, who's going to do it?",
        "I believe part of this war was exactly about that.",
        "Hezbollah did not want to be disarmed, nor did Iran and Syria want Hezbollah disarmed.",
        "In a way, they are also the secondary losers as well as American foreign policy.",
        "We'll get back to that if you wish later.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "But I believe that Hezbollah will have to disarm.",
        "Otherwise, I believe that there will be a resumption of this war one way or another.",
        "It cannot end fully and with the full cease-fire -sustainable cease-fire with Hezbollah keeping its weapons.",
        "If there is one winner, if one wants to call on one winner in this war, it is probably the sovereignty of the state of Lebanon.",
        "Hopefully, at least, it is a place now where only the state of Lebanon has the right of sovereignty throughout Lebanon.",
        "In that sense, that is hopefully - that will be sustainable.",
        "And in that case, Lebanon, the country, will be the winner despite this very dear cost to its people and its infrastructure.",
        "And if that is sustainable, if that does happen, that was indeed one of Israel's goals in this conflict.",
        "How could Israel then be called a loser?",
        "Well, I'm not so sure that this was the main reason behind this war.",
        "I think also - I don't think it was only Israel's decision to go into this war.",
        "I think it's a war that was wanted by Syria and Iran as well.",
        "So I'm not - I wouldn't be comfortable saying Israel went into this war in order to rid Hezbollah of its weapons, and therefore it can claim victory.",
        "I would argue that this is not really the case.",
        "But I think Israel has been a loser because it's been exposed as almost a paper tiger, when everyone in the world thought Israeli military power was so powerful that it would have taken a week - everybody thought - to finish up this war.",
        "Well, a month later, and Israel needed to be bailed out.",
        "I would not call that victory.",
        "I don't know who will.",
        "Yeah, I mean, the supply-and-demand theorists, they say that if you take a look at increased demand in China, in emerging markets, and there's worries about supply, that that fundamentally is pushing up the price.",
        "However, even OPEC - you know, a lot of oil companies have testified and they'll say, yeah, there should be a rise in price because of these factors, but it should not have been this fast or this sharp.",
        "And they said, for that reason, they believe there's a speculate element in the rise in oil prices.",
