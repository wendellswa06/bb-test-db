        "I think Hezbollah also showed significant brutality and stupidity.",
        "But by and large, I think they'll be stronger for it, and that's the way that's going to go.",
        "I also…",
        "Stronger, Al, as a military force or stronger as a political force?",
        "I think eventually both.",
        "I don't know what the big deal was about the press and the American government pointing out they were being supported and armed by Iran or Syria.",
        "I mean, they've got to get their weapons from somebody.",
        "America supplies weapons to Israel.",
        "Yeah, but they're one faction.",
        "They're a militia.",
        "They're not the Lebanese army.",
        "No, but they're part of the Lebanese government, and they're highly supported, by the way, by Lebanese people.",
        "I had the pleasure of seeing Beirut, by the way, twice in my life -before it was destroyed the first time in ‘82 by Israel, and very recently last year when I was heading out of Iraq.",
        "And it was a very beautiful city with very sophisticated and intelligent people.",
        "I mean, what happened there is a complete and absolute crime.",
        "But to finish my comment…",
        "And very quickly if you would, please.",

        "What about his comments about Mr. Nasrallah, you know, sustaining his place as a political force in Lebanon, Raghida?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I agree, by the way, with what the caller said about the Israel part of his comment.",
        "But I disagree with him on the Hezbollah part of his comment, because I believe that one would have to eliminate the other.",
        "Either Hezbollah would have to eliminate the State of Lebanon, or the State of Lebanon would have to eliminate Hezbollah in terms of who has sovereignty in the country.",
        "I do not believe Hezbollah can go on having its weapons independent of the Lebanese army.",
        "It is definitely a political force in the country.",
        "It is - Hezbollah has got lots of followers, but just like others, had been militias and delivered their weapons to the State of Lebanon.",
        "I think Hezbollah will have to do that.",
        "There is no way that they can continue back - you know, that will be going back to the status quo ante.",
        "And this is not allowed, not by the United Nations, not by the resolution, not by the United States, not by Israel - not even by Lebanon, really.",
        "Lebanon needs to get on its own feet, and nobody elected Hezbollah to take this country to war when it wishes to.",
        "One last question before we run out of time in this segment.",
        "And that is at this point - given the destruction that was visited upon the State of Lebanon and the economic destruction in the long term - if it stops here, is Lebanon going to be able to recover in fairly short order?",
        "So maybe Woody will learn from this and one of his New Year's resolutions will be to stop making films like \"\"Hollywood Ending.\"\" As for my New Year's resolution, I'm going to promise that when I go to the multiplex I will stop sneaking in outside food and drink, like microwave chimichangas--unless I have enough to share with everyone.",
        "I learned that the hard way.",
        "If it stops here, yes.",
        "The resilience of the Lebanese is well known, and I think also people are feeling bad for this country that has paid the price over and over again.",
        "I think the international community - if there is a strong Lebanese central government and army and a new face for Lebanon - not only the international community but also the Arab world - and I think the Lebanese at large will come back and say hey, listen, this is a country now on a different road, and it's enough suffering.",
        "But again, we have to wait to see of this resolution is implemented, if there is in fact a cease-fire or whether it is going to be a temporary cessation of hostilities, where things are going to go back to this horrible war that came up on this country so unfortunately.",

        "So who won and who lost in your view?",

        "And it was interesting to hear the previous discussion, because I think that a lot of this has to do with internal Lebanese issues.",
        "And Hassan Nasrallah, head of Hezbollah, has been defending himself in the Lebanese area for the last two or three days.",
        "The very shrill, hysterical threats to destroy Israel, to bomb Israel, surprises -none of those seem to really pan out, so that they keep backtracking a little bit.",
        "There's no euphoria in Israel.",
        "There's a relatively solemn attitude.",
        "Certainly, Israel doesn't feel like its forces were defeated, but it should have been better.",
        "It should have been quicker.",
        "And it's interesting that the prime minister, Ehud Olmert - who's in quite a bit of trouble now for questions about the hesitation.",
        "Why did it take four weeks to begin a ground campaign?",
        "Why when it began was it stopped immediately with a cease-fire?",
        "Couldn't the missiles that were being shot by Hezbollah on a daily basis and seemed to increase towards the end?",
        "Could the Israeli army be sent out to deal with those earlier?",
        "But it's interesting that Olmert in his speech today before the country said that there will be another round.",
        "I think Israelis are very aware of the fact that this conflict is far from over, and it's really mainly about Iran.",
        "The previous discussion talked a little bit about Iran and Syria, and the - sort of - the rant that we heard from the caller about weapons…",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Hezbollah is a creature largely of Iran.",
        "Not entirely.",
        "They have their own internal issues, but it is definitely a Shiite radical - Shiite Iranian outpost in Lebanon.",
        "And from an Israeli perspective, it was very important.",
        "The goal was to destroy or prevent Iran from using Hezbollah to attack Israel as sort of a proxy or a branch of the Iranian capability.",
        "We're entering a period of confrontation with Iran over its nuclear weapons program."

        "Perhaps after that sanction, the tension's going to increase.",
        "Not having Hezbollah capable of attacking Israel as a branch of Iran is very much a large part of the environment here.",
        "And there I think - at least for the short term - Hezbollah's been dealt a major blow.",
        "It will have to rebuild its weapons stockpiles.",
        "It will have to rebuild its concrete fortresses under the houses, the mosques, the schools of Southern Lebanon.",

        "They're not going to be able to move back in and mount a major military campaign against Israel on behalf Iran or threaten to do that.",
        "So it's very much a mix, and that element is something Israelis are very aware of.",

        "Well, I'm not as confident she is.",

        "But Lebanon is going through some changes at such a critical period, and I think in addition to the Iranian element, the Lebanese element is critical.",
        "We have to remember Lebanon has been a failed state.",
        "It's been easily used and exploited by terrorists in the 1970s by the PLO and then after that the Hezbollah, because the Lebanese State lacked the coherence to be able to have its own sovereignty, its own army.",
        "What are we talking about now?",

        "The question will be what will happen to the Shiites' power that exists?",
        "Will they be more absorbed into the Lebanese polity?",
        "Will the become the mainstream of the Lebanese army and how will that transform?",
        "What's going to be the role of Syria also in this process?",

        "As much as there is pain - and I'm not sure if it's justified or not, I'm not qualified to really state that - but it just seems to me that it took this much to get the United Nations to act, and you wonder if they really were going to act, anyway.",
        "It's almost out of desperation that they acted.",
        "So I think my thoughts are that if with all the different elements that goes on in the Middle East - that if the United Nations is going to take the strong role trying to keep some sort of order there then they need to either do it, because if they don't do it this is what you get.",
