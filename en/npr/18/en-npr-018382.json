        "We've had a U.N.",
        "force UNIFIL sitting in Lebanon since the late 1970s.",
        "They haven't done anything except occasionally cooperated with Hezbollah.",
        "They've been, if anything, part of the problem -certainly not part of the solution.",
        "And unfortunately, when we had the incident with some of the U.N.",
        "forces were killed, they had reported in e-mails before that that Hezbollah was using their territory and there was a lot of fraternization.",
        "So what's changed here?",
        "Israelis need to see a better explanation.",
        "I think there's going to be a lot of emphasis and demand of the government - of the prime minister, the defense minister - to explain why this risk was taken.",
        "Unless the U.N.",
        "all of a sudden - and the U.N.",
        "is really a collection of its members - Europe has a major role here.",
        "The United States is stretched beyond its capabilities in Iraq.",
        "And Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State, brokered the cease-fire agreement, but the actual troops that are going to provide the backbone that are supposed to be sitting in Southern Lebanon preventing more of these incidents of attacks from Hezbollah - kidnappings and killings - those are supposed to be provided by the French, by the Italians, largely by European forces.",
        "And there's very little faith in Israel that Europe has any capability of dealing with security in general or Israeli security in particular, and the United Nations is seen as very much a one-sided organization.",
        "We had this vote of the U.S.",
        "Human Rights Council just a couple of days ago condemning Israel for defending itself.",
        "We have the role of the groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty promoting these attacks - these political attacks - through the U.N.",
        "against Israel.",
        "So Israelis don't really understand why all of a sudden the U.N.",
        "looks good or what's happened here.",
        "Perhaps there's an effort.",
        "Perhaps there's a sense that there is a change going on - greater seriousness - particularly about extremist Islamic organizations and that something different will happen, but I can't say there's a lot of confidence there.",

        "And it's good to have you on the program again.",
        "Good to be on.",
        "What are the repercussions of this conflict for - well, let's talk about the direct combatants first.",
        "For the direct combatants - well, I mean, I'm not, you know - what we have now is a situation that is still extremely fragile to see whether in fact the cease-fire's going to hold.",
        "You have a very complicated synchronization between the withdrawal of troops and the introduction - withdrawal of the Israeli troops, introduction of both Lebanese and international troops, and what will happen to Hezbollah.",
        "So I think it's a bit too soon to try to see - to try to make a real - try to decide what the outcome was.",

        "We had both Prime Minister Olmert and Hassan Nasrallah declaring victory today.",
        "Do you think either is justified?",
        "Well, I think it's very hard for Prime Minister Olmert to declare victory.",
        "The question is go back and see what both sides had said were their goals at the outset.",
        "Prime Minister Olmert set out very grandiose goals of wiping out Hezbollah and not allowing it to remain in the south and disarming it.",
        "Well, at this point, those don't seem to be achievable goals, even though the resolution, the UN resolution, mentioned a number of them.",
        "I don't think anyone should hold his breath to wait to see those things to happen.",
        "On the other side, Hussein Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, declared early on that he defined victory as simply staying put and resisting the Israeli onslaught.",
        "And certainly from the point of view of the Lebanese people and the Arab and Muslim people throughout the world, he succeeded.",
        "And he succeeded beyond their expectations and beyond what any Arab military force has done in the past.",
        "So comparing the outcome and the outlook for both, the Israeli prime minister and the head of Hezbollah, I think it's pretty clear who emerges at this point in time - and it's still a fluid picture - but at this point in time, I think it's pretty hard not to recognize that Hezbollah comes out ahead.",
        "What about the larger picture within Lebanon?",
        "That's where the Hezbollah is going to have more of a problem.",
        "In fact, I think it prevailed in its struggle against Israel simply because it didn't lose, and that's always the definition of success for a guerilla militant organization.",
        "It's going to have a harder time prevailing on the Lebanese scene, and that's where I think the coming weeks and months are going to be critical.",
        "How does he manage?",
        "How does Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, manage to both maintain his weapons, maintain the aura of a militant group, and yet not run afoul of the other Lebanese forces - many of which are going to start asking for the movement's disarmament and for its re-conversion as a political - truly political, organization.",
        "So the Lebanese scene is going to be the most difficult now to manage in some ways, and the risk of confrontation between the various sectarian groups is still very high.",
        "We hear from Lebanese people on all sides.",
        "Recrimination is beginning, the Shiites feel that they were betrayed by some of the others, some of the Sunnis and Christians who let them down during the war.",
        "And some of the Sunnis and Christians believe that Hezbollah dragged them into war for no purpose.",
        "So that's where I think the next rebel is going to move."

        "Who's going to disarm Hezbollah?",

        "Well, there was another resolution.",
        "It's called UN Security Council Resolution 1559, which also ordered Hezbollah to be disarmed.",
        "It's not going to happen through military means, neither the Lebanese army nor the UN force, nor anyone else is going to disarm Hezbollah.",
        "If it's going to happen, it's going to happen gradually through a political process whereby, number one: the arguments are pretext justifications that Hezbollah invokes to maintain its military weapons will have to be dealt with one by one.",
        "And second: the regional picture is going to have to change, and that's going to involve the much more robust diplomatic effort by the United States to try to involve Syrians; to try to get the peace process between Syria and Israel re-launched; to try again to take away from Hezbollah, both its justifications and its regional supporters, in terms of it keeping its military identity.",
        "It's going to take time, and no one I know in Lebanon has the appetite now to go after Hezbollah and risk a civil confrontation.",

        "My comment is, I believe that we in the United States have lost tremendously in terms of prestige and in terms of one of the fundamental points that we had to fight terrorism.",
        "Which his the terrorists initiate actions which cause tremendous damage and death among civilian populations, and then they sit back and sort of justify it that, you know, civilians have to be killed in order for us to do whatever it is that they want to do.",
        "And I believe that, in a tremendous way, our country has suffered because in the face of tremendous civilian death and destruction, our government stood by and justified itself by saying, well, this is just a means to an end.",
        "And so then if you think about, we have made ourselves the equal in a philosophical sense, of those who have done damage to us and killed our people.",
        "And now how are we going to say to them that we are a just society when we stood by, our taxpayer, our government just stood by and allowed this destruction, and we know we could have stopped it, and we justified it saying, well, it was just a means to an end.",
        "So how does that help us?",
        "And I'll take my…",
        "Alright.",
        "Sam, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Robert Malley, I'm not sure I followed Sam's logic entirely, but the United States certainly did look like it was giving the Israelis the green light to go ahead and pursue their aims.",
        "I think the point is absolutely well taken.",
        "You know, you've asked your other guests who are the winners and losers.",
        "I think it's very hard to identify winners at this point.",
        "But the losers are clear: the Lebanese people, I think Israel has lost, I think U.S.",
        "diplomacy, the U.S.",

        "And for what end?",
