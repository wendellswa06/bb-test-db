        "Because success generates constituents and success generates power.",
        "And the fact is it's going to take a period of time to judge and to determine with an degree of precision or authority whether or not this operation, and the diplomatic and military implications, have succeeded or failed.",
        "Will the LAF emerge as a credible, competent force?",
        "Will a beefed up UNIFIL have a mandate that will not only ensure border security, but deal with a very contentious area south of Litani River.",
        "Will that same force in the Lebanese government be able to impose an arms embargo to cut the supply of Iranian - re-supply of Iranian rockets to Hezbollah?",
        "You know, I'm sure, that supply has already begun.",
        "And will the Lebanese government ultimately be able to take measures, probably - Mr. Malley is right - through a political process to disarm Hezbollah.",
        "So I think in fairness, and not to get locked into winners and losers too early, time ultimately will be the great judge.",
        "LAF you referred to, the Lebanese armed forces?",
        "Yes.",
        "That's right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Within the situation, do you agree that this fighting -after 34 days - that we could've reached the same situation we are in now, much, much earlier?",
        "Probably, but then you'd have to convince the Israelis and the Hezbollahi that it wasn't in their respective interest to try to achieve their objectives and goals on the battlefield.",
        "And here I think the U.S.",
        "role is extremely critical and very important."

        "It's more than likely, over the next two years, Israel's occupation of the West Bank will continue.",
