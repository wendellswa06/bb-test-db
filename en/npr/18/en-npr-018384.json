        "You know, these people may never get back into that city, and they may never get back into that polity, and it's really a remarkable thing to behold how a diverse and complex and society by this terrible natural disaster, is now going to be remade.",

        "Now, fairness, all this stuff is contextual, and I'm not going to substitute my judgment for the judges, and I'm certainly not going to substitute the judges' judgment with the NAACP's judgment because I distrust the NAACP.",

        "Hopefully that won't be a large breach, but they should step into the breach with buses or what have you.",
        "The NAACP, the churches, various civic associations, they can help the New Orleans political infrastructure that probably--when you get right down to it - probably don't want a lot of these people coming to participate in this election.",
        "That's exactly my point.",
        "Of course the NAACP should do what it can, but the cost of getting those people to the polls is higher than the cost of other people in the electorate.",
        "Your position in the queue to vote, in effect, depends how high your house was relative to sea level when that flood took place.",
        "The poor and black people of New Orleans are being effectively, relatively, disenfranchised by what's happening, and that's my point.",
        "Whose city is it?",
        "It's not about a chocolate city; it's about did everybody who lived in the city before the flood have, in effect, one man, one vote with respect to their position in the polity right afterwards, and what's playing out here is that they did not.",
        "The poor people on low ground are at the back of the queue with respect to the political process, and that's a fact.",
        "And then there are always misnomers when we talk about things like this, when we talk about whose city is it and was it.",
        "It depends on how you define how you own a city because even prior to Katrina, disproportionately it was a black city by virtue of residence, but it was never a black city in terms of total power.",
        "And even prior to Katrina, there were people who were disinterested in voting and people who would not vote.",

        "A total of 68 percent of the people polled said they worry a great deal about having that available to them; coming in second, Social Security, the Social Security system.",

        "I don't say that at all.",
        "It may be that the respondents to that Gallup Poll simply are ignorant about what the actual situation is, so they underestimate the threat.",
        "But the fact is that we can't assess what might be out there because everything that you need to know in order to make an objective assessment about it is secret, is classified.",

        "I think the president is on the wrong track in terms of trying to deal with the international threat, but I'm not at all surprised to see that the voting public doesn't have a keen sense of concern because we don't have the facts that we would need to make an assessment about it.",

        "They talked about drug use, crime, violence; the possibility of terror attacks came in at 45 percent.",

        "We've seen all kinds of accounts recently of people losing their jobs or facing the possibility of losing their job and the benefits that might have come with that.",
        "We've seen information about the gap, the continuing gap between the haves and the have-nots.",
        "So it becomes a real personal issue for you.",
        "But I would argue that if we were to analyze these polling results a little better, and we don't have the wherewithal to do that today, we might find that there's a geographical difference in people's priorities.",
