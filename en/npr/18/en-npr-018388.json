        "The first 25 days of July, 98 people have died in the desert along the US-Mexican border; that, in comparison to 60 people who died the same time for the entire month of July last year.",
        "Now granted it is a very hot summer this year, but, Marcelo, this becomes--or continues to become a growing problem for the United States.",
        "It's indeed a growing problem and, again, like in the case of Darfur, these are issues that have been with us before.",
        "We've seen this.",
        "What we are witnessing now is an intensification of a dynamic that characterizes the US international border, especially the southern sector of the border with Mexico.",
        "Over one person dies every day now if you look at the average yearly death toll.",
        "This clearly indicates another failure of policy.",
        "Simply what we've done is we make the desert a huge detour area to deal with a problem that requires much, much more integrated international cooperation.",
        "What the Border Control Initiative has done is it has increased the violence and the deaths at the border, and it has done nothing to prevent the flows of undocumented, unauthorized immigration to the United States.",
        "It's creating problems.",
        "It's not solving problems.",
        "More people are dying.",
        "More unauthorized immigrants that would otherwise return to their countries, would go back to Mexico, would go back to El Salvador, would go back to Haiti, would go back to the countries that now dominate immigration to the United States, are simply trapped on the US side of the border.",
        "This is a catastrophic failure, a failure that needs an international bilateral series of agreements because we are now apprehending over a million people at the border every year.",
        "Over a million people are apprehended and we probably have over 10, 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States now."

        "Well, I agree and the situation of undocumented workers and undocumented aliens, immigrants is an enormous tragedy and casualty with respect to the people who are trying to get into the United States to work, for freedom, for a better way of life.",
        "The problem is: How will you control your borders?",
        "And you have to control your borders and, therefore, you do need intelligent thinking and planning and international cooperation and agreements because a country has got to control its borders.",
        "Julianne Malveaux, one of the interesting points about controlling the borders, particularly in the West and the Southwest, is that this administration, quite frankly, administrations before it, have looked at the bottom line when looking at their budgets and just do not feel this important enough to give more money to a situation when you look at hundreds of miles of border being patrolled by one officer ofttimes only two or three days a week.",
        "You cannot be serious about, as Marcelo suggested, correcting this problem.",
        "You're absolutely right.",
        "I mean, I think the hidden piece here is the bilateral economic relationship between the United States and Mexico; the fact that the standards of living are so different.",
        "And there has been a wink, wink, nod, nod at undocumented entry here.",
        "In other words, there are whole industries that would probably shut down if we did not have undocumented workers.",
        "Who would pick our lettuce and our tomatoes in California?",
        "Who would do some of that work?",
        "I mean, Vincente Fox raised it in a very racist way, but he raised it when he talked about, you know, Mexicans take the work that even blacks won't take.",
        "I mean, let's not go there.",
        "But he made a point, and the fact is that we have industrial sectors that depend on this undocumented labor.",
        "So somehow we have decided if somebody is bad enough, bold enough, strong enough to get over here, they'll be hired under the table, but, meanwhile, back at the ranch, they'll be held...",
        "Or they will die in the desert.",
        "...or they'll be held in the desert.",
        "Yeah, that is the alternative.",
        "And so I think that the conversation that we fail to have--and Mr. Bush actually started out OK with this because he and Vincente Fox had a relationship and they talked, but he started out talking about ways to deal with this.",
        "September 11th, of course, interrupted any kind of conversation there.",
        "Right.",
        "And now under the guise of so-called terrorism, we're dealing with these borders in ways that I think are untenable.",

        "Now subsequently we have seen apologies coming from the city as well as Miami Parks Director Ernest Burkeen whom we should note is black, suggesting that they would rename the talent show.",
        "But he also said that the word ghetto was used to imply a down home show and not in an offensive way, but embracing the culture, Michael Meyers, of today's youth and using their language.",
        "Well, you used the word ridiculous.",
        "But I think it's ridiculous all around.",
        "However, I have to acknowledge, whether you call it ghetto show or inner-city culture show or soul show or soul talent show, whatever you call it, there has been an internalization, if you will, of stereotypes, an internalization of self-hatred.",

        "So they renamed this thing to the funk show.",

        "Marcelo, one of the interesting points that can be made, that Michael Meyers touched on there, is the idea of taking something that's seen as a negative, internalizing it and saying there's nothing wrong with it.",
        "Comedian Jamie Foxx said to me recently that, `Why shouldn't I be able to joke about eating watermelon as a comedian and being black when Jewish comedians for years have had fun joking about bagels and lox and things that are endearing'--quote--`\"\"in their community and not worry about it?\"\"'",
