        "Well, as someone who writes haiku every day, I'm also inspired by the cherry blossoms, and I appreciate how people are inspired by them.",
        "But I also think it's funny to see the haiku kind of come and go with the blossoms.",
        "So you'll see a big bloom of haiku on Twitter, when the cherry blossoms bloom.",
        "And then so many people - that's it.",
        "That's their haiku for the year, and then they're moving on to other things.",

        "That was Christine Colon, in San Diego; Tim O'Malley, in Scranton, Pa.; Judy Totts, in Medina, Ohio; Paul Conneally, who sent us a poem all the way from England; and Peyton Price, from the Washington, D.C., suburbs.",
        "Now, if you'd like to see the gorgeous flowers these poets are writing about for yourself, you can head to our website.",

        "Why would Syrian mortar fire continue falling inside Turkey given that the Syrians, when this started happening last week, said it was a mistake?",
        "Well, the mortars do keep coming.",
        "And there are a number of theories why.",
        "Some people say it might be a deliberate effort to widen the conflict, drag Turkey into the fight.",
        "And we have to remember that if NATO member Turkey does get involved that raises a number of other questions, not least what will the U.S.",
        "and other NATO member states do at the point.",
        "There are even some who speculate that the rebel fighters could be capturing mortars and aiming them into Turkey trying to bring Ankara into the conflict on their side.",
        "Not much evidence of that so far, but you can't rule it out.",
        "But the best explanation so far seems to be that these are probably misfires that go of course.",
        "Now, you might ask why now.",
        "The reason could be the intensified fighting between the Free Syrian Army and loyalist forces in areas right next to the border, including Tel Abyad border post and the village of Khirbet al-Jouz.",

        "So there are more mortars being fired on the border, increasing the chances of some landing inside Turkey and increasing the chances of more civilian deaths, which could escalate things further.",
        "I suppose there have been calls for some kind of safe zone for rebels with inside Syria.",
        "If the Syrian military were to back away from the border, it would effectively create that safe zone, wouldn't it?",
        "It would.",
        "And there was a stray report of a 10 kilometer pull back on the Syrian side.",
        "That seems not to be the case, certainly in the fighting around Khirbet al-Jouz, which is near the Hatay side, on that side of the border.",
        "And that is well inside the 10 kilometer zone.",
        "There is some speculation that the heavier artillery on the Syrian side may be pulled back a bit, which would create a, sort of, a de facto safe zone.",
        "I would say from what we're hearing from the activists and from Syrian state media that that is certainly not consistently being observed and I wouldn't count on it.",
        "Peter, in the last several days we've had very loud voices from the United States and elsewhere demanding that Syria cut this out and urging calm.",
        "But what leverage really does the international community have here?",
        "Well, that's an excellent point.",
        "So far it's mostly rhetoric outpacing action, as we've seen all along.",
        "It is notable that Russia and China, Syria's allies, have added their voices to the calls for restraint.",
        "But no one, for instance, is calling on Turkey to pull its troops and artillery back.",
        "And Prime Minister Erdogan has made clear that every incident will be responded to.",
        "Now, the Turks, of course, are as worried about armed Kurds on the border as the Syrian army.",

        "The opposition is leading many of the anti-war rallies here in Turkey.",

        "Peter, as best you can determine, who is winning the war on the ground?",
        "And by this I mean the war between the Syrian rebels and the Syrian government?",
        "Difficult to know exactly, of course.",
        "State media claims ongoing victories.",

        "There is a randomness, especially once these bigger, dramatic world events occur, of who is actually going to end up in that moment in that place, whether it's the guy I knew who was supposed to return his rental car to the Trade Center on the day of the attack and just, for whatever reason, didn't make it there.",

        "And he basically bottomed out.",
