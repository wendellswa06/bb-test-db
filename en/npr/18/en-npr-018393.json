        "So the FBI coding system that you used just wasn't going to work.",
        "Well, that's true, and the reason for that is that the FBI's system is built upon being able to obtain high-quality DNA.",
        "And the FBI coding system is called CODIS, which is like a national DNA index that we commonly use or routinely use to identify rapists and murderers who've been arrested in the past, and then we can compare their DNA against DNA found at the crime scene, for example.",

        "(Announcements)",
        "Well, most public forensic DNA laboratories utilize the FBI's CODIS system, which is the national DNA index, and we use this to identify rapists and murderers by matching crime-scene samples to DNA taken from these people when they're arrested and incarcerated.",
        "But the World Trade Center was different because the DNA was not very good quality DNA and, in fact, it was what we call part--we got partial DNA profiles.",
        "And no one had ever done much work before to utilize partial DNA profiles to make identifications, so we had to put a whole series of new things, processes, into place in order to make identifications.",
        "And in order to do this, we convened a panel of about 30 scientists who sit down and discuss these issues.",
        "These are people who are geneticists, people who have had mass disaster experience, although none of them had experience with something like this before.",
        "And we put in rules to enable us to make these identifications so that we were certain that we were not making mistakes.",
        "You write in your book that--and I'll quote from it--\"\"I decided early in October 2001 to venture away from the tried and true\"\"--and you say--use a term STRs--\"\"used daily in forensic work worldwide, because I knew in my heart that path would not return enough of the missing to their families.",
        "Unfortunately, the path I chose left my staff emotionally drained and created problems for my laboratory's daily routines.",
        "My decision dragged out the testing by at least two years, probably longer, and it almost killed me.",
        "While I'm sorry for the extra work and intense emotional pressure I heaped upon my staff, I will never apologize for bringing loved ones back to their families, loved ones who, without these new technologies, would forever remain nameless.",
        "Can you explain what that means, what you did and how--the new territory you had to blaze there to make this work, and why it was such an exhausting situation for you?",
        "Well, the first thing I noticed was that, like I said, we were having partial DNA profiles.",
        "And the amount of DNA in the DNA information we were getting was so skimpy that we'd never be able to make identifications.",
        "So we had to--I had to look at other ways of analyzing DNA.",
        "The fact that there was DNA there gave me hope that maybe we could do something about it.",
        "So we looked at a couple of different things.",
        "One, we looked at what we call miniplexes, and these are different ways of looking at STRs, but in such a way that we can look at smaller pieces of DNA than we had been looking at in the past.",
        "And so by looking at smaller pieces of DNA--because what happens when DNA deteriorates, it fragments into smaller and smaller pieces.",
        "So I reasoned that if we could look at some of those smaller pieces, we might be able to make more identifications.",
        "So what happened--we had to have the laboratory reinvent a wheel, so to speak.",
        "They had to go back and do research to make sure that these techniques worked, and then we had to put them through an exhaustive proficiency testing program.",
        "We had to make sure that what they were--the results they were getting were valid on the kinds of samples that we had in the laboratory.",
        "So this took a year to get this work done.",
        "So it extended the process because we had to research it to make sure it was working properly.",
        "But on the day that we finally--we started that process in March 2002, and in December 2002 we got our first day--actually, we started that process in November 2001.",
        "And by December 2002, on the first day we got data, we got five new identifications.",
        "And for all of us in the laboratory at the medical examiner's office, it was, you know, high fives and we were hugging each other because we just--we had been getting very, very few identifications, and to get five new ones at exactly that--from this new data, it was just a terrific feeling.",
        "So that was one of the new things we did.",
        "Another thing we did was to look at even smaller pieces of DNA, and we used--identified mutations on the DNA called SNPs, which stands for single nucleotide polymorphisms.",
        "And although SNPs have been around for a long time and people know about them and the pharmaceutical industry is using them, they'd never been used for this kind of a purpose before.",
        "They'd never been used to make identifications in a mass disaster where the quality of the DNA is really bad."

        "And so it wasn't until late in 2004 when we started getting all of the data from the SNPs, and finally when we got that data, we were able to make new identifications from that as well.",
        "And what really happened as far as new identifications was concerned is we were able to take these new technologies and marry them to the tried-and-true technology.",
        "So we get a piece of the data from the original STR testing, we get another piece of data from the miniplex testing, and then we get another piece of data from SNP testing.",
        "And we could make an identification that way.",
        "Otherwise, without any of those technol--with the original technology, we would never make the identification.",
        "But you would have to have something to compare it to, right, an original?",
        "That's exactly right, and there's two ways to do that.",
        "One is what we call direct testing, where you take a sample from the person who's missing, which could be from a toothbrush; it could be a biopsy; it could be biological fluid from a pair of underwear--and you take that DNA and you get a DNA profile from it and you put that into a database.",
        "And then you take a DNA profile from a piece of tissue from a mass disaster, and you put that into a database, and hopefully you have the appropriate kind of software that can help you match those samples up.",
        "So that's called a direct test.",
        "There's also an indirect test, which is much like a paternity test.",
        "So you get biological samples from the biological relatives of the person who's missing, which could be a mother and a father, it could be brothers and sisters or it could be combinations.",
        "And what you're doing is you're creating the genetic profile of that family.",
        "And so when you get the DNA profile of the fragment from the mass disaster site, you see if that genetic profile fits into the genetic structure of the family.",
        "And if it does, then you have an identification.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow.",
        "Well, New York City set up family assistance centers, and these were set up in various places around the city, but the one that was there the longest was on Pier 94 on the--along the Hudson River.",
        "And families would come and they would be interviewed and they would give samples.",
        "We had provided police department with sort of like a road map on the kinds of samples you could collect.",
        "The problem is that the police who were collecting the samples didn't understand DNA testing; they don't understand identification using DNA.",
        "They're not the...",
        "In fact, that was not really their job to do that in a normal situation, right?",
        "Oh, normally they don't do things like that, that's correct.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You had to train them how to do that as sort of on-the-job training.",
