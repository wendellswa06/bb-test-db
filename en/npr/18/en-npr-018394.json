        "The family assistance center, I believe, was set up--the first one was set up on Thursday...",
        "Right.",
        "...which would be the 13th of September.",
        "And they weren't prepared to do it, and so a lot of mistakes were made.",
        "And samples were collected inappropriately; they were labeled improperly.",
        "And this created a huge nightmare for us because we had to go back and sort out these problems because if you don't, then you put the wrong name to a piece you get from the mass disaster site, and you end up giving samples back to a family that shouldn't have it.",
        "1 (800) 989-8255 is our number, 1 (800) 989-TALK.",
        "Have all the samples been identified now?",
        "No.",
        "There are significant--there's about 1,100-plus samples which have not been identified.",
        "Some of these have very poor DNA quality in them.",
        "Some of them have absolutely no DNA left in them.",
        "So the ones with no DNA will never, ever be identified.",
        "And these are typically the samples that came from the hottest parts of the burning buildings.",
        "These are bones which are pure white; they have no biological material left in them.",
        "We call these kinds of bones creamains, very much like a cremated sample.",
        "Were there any lessons from your experience with forensics and the World Trade Center that might have or were possibly used in identifying body with the Katrina victims?",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "They--every step in the identification process created a lesson for us, and--because there were mistakes made all along the way, and mistakes in that we just didn't have the processing set up and we had to learn how to do them.",
        "And what we learned is that people tend to make the same mistakes over and over again, and when they began getting in to make the identifications at Katrina, I was working with some folks in Louisiana, trying to help them from making the same mistakes that we did.",
        "And by and large, they did correct some of those mistakes, but then they had another set of problems that they had to work with, and the problems that they had were different from the problems we had in New York.",
        "You eventually had to give up--I don't mean give up the project, but you had to stop trying to identify samples.",
        "Why was that?"

        "We ran out of technology.",
        "We had taken the technology that we were using as far as it could go, and we weren't getting any new identifications out using it.",
        "So it's time to what we call a pause and back off for a while with the intent of, when new technology comes along, we would pick up the project again.",
        "Were the families of the victims cooperative, or did they see this as an intrusion?",
        "They were the most terrific people I'd ever met in my life.",
        "They helped us; they were supportive of us.",
        "All they ever demanded from us was to tell them the truth and not to pull punches on them.",
        "You know, they would come through the laboratory and we would explain the process and what the DNA process was and what kind of data we were collecting and how we interpreted it.",
        "It was really important to them that we demystify the DNA process.",
        "You can just imagine, you get a piece of bone back which is maybe six inches long, and that's the only piece you get back.",
        "And they ask, `Well, how did you make the identification?",
        "And you say, `Well, DNA made the identification.",
        "Well, to a layperson, what does that mean?",
        "They have to have incredible faith that you as a scientists, that you as a government worker are doing the kind of job and the quality job to now enable you to make that kind of a decision and say that this piece of bone came from your loved one.",
        "And as most people are a little skeptical of government in general, you have to do more than just say that to them; you have to show them and you have to show them the controls you've put into place.",
        "And this is exactly what we did.",
        "We had weekly meetings with these families.",
        "We talked to them.",
        "Our lines were open to them.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And on top of that, I think they felt a compassion that we had for their loved ones.",
        "And when I'd make an identification or my other staff would make--others on my staff would make identifications, we saw the pictures of these missing people on our computer screens, so we could put a face to a name.",
        "And I think the ones who saw that really appreciated the fact that we did that.",
        "Were there people who just didn't want to know, don't--you know...",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah, `I just can't deal with it.'"

        "They also identified the people who died in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the night...",
        "Yes.",

        "And what has all this done to you?",
        "Well, it's given me a different perspective on life and given me another cause in life, so to speak, and that cause has to come through the education process.",
        "One of the things I learned in going through this is that the young people in this country are not prepared to do this.",
        "And I just thought that by coming to Penn State and starting a new forensic science program that I could be instrumental in helping young people get to the point where they could handle something like this because part of our program is to talk to them about handling mass disasters.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Is this something for incoming freshmen, for everybody, or is it somebody who wants to go into forensics?",
        "Well, it's for both.",
        "It's for forensic--for students who are coming into the college as freshmen and they want to go into forensic science.",
        "We've established a four-year baccalaureate program, which I think is probably the most rigorous program in the country.",
        "When I was a director of the laboratory in New York City I invariably saw students who walked through the doors looking for jobs who had even master's degrees, didn't even know how to make up solutions, didn't know how to use a pipette.",
        "And I thought that was really bad.",
        "How could anyone in a position like I had hire someone who really didn't understand the very basics of science?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So the program that I wanted when I came to Penn State was to create a program that created first scientists and then forensic scientists.",
        "And that's--and we've put together an extremely rigorous program so that when these students leave Penn State, they're going to be the best-trained and the best students to go into the profession.",
        "Now we've also created a master's program and we're going to build upon our baccalaureate program.",
        "It is the most rigorous master's program I know of in the country.",
        "And our goal is to create quality scientists and quality forensic scientists.",
        "And one of the things we're doing with these students is teaching them from the mistakes that others have made.",
        "You know, if someone has made a mistake, these things get publicized in the newspapers and you can go and get the information and you can find out why the mistake was made.",
        "And these become great teaching lessons for students.",
        "So that once they understand the underpinnings of the profession, which is basic science, then they can go off and they can--they'll be able to handle the rigors of the real world when they get out."
