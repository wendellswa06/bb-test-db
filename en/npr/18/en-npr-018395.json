        "You mean the terrorists?",
        "I'll take my answers off the air.",
        "OK.",
        "I think he meant the terrorists.",
        "Did you collect any terrorist DNA?",
        "Could you identify them?",
        "We identified three of the terrorists.",
        "I was surprised because I didn't think any of the--anyone from the planes would be identified because just the way the planes hit and then exploded.",
        "But apparently--rumor was that passengers were herded to the back of the plane and guarded there so that when the planes hit the buildings and exploded it apparently blew--fragmented them but also blew them out of the main fireball.",
        "And so we were able to identify some of them.",
        "And when we started seeing identifications of people on the planes coming through, we though maybe we would be able to identify some of the terrorists, as well.",
        "So we contacted the FBI to see if the FBI would--had any information or any DNA from the terrorists or had access to it.",
        "And it took us about a year to get that all together.",
        "We finally got a letter from the FBI that gave us 10 DNA profiles that were coded.",
        "We didn't have names associated with them, but presumably from the terrorists, and we made a couple of identifications immediately.",
        "And then a third one came at a later time.",
        "You say in your book that--you describe working with the FBI as `an exasperating experience.'",
        "Yeah, well they--you know, the FBI is--has its own way of doing things and I guess getting approvals through the system is tedious and tough.",
        "And it's hard to work with them because they aren't always very cooperative.",
        "There's always something going on that--I don't know what it--it's hard to say what it is, but just getting them to work with you and cooperate is tough.",
        "You know, when this first happened they came right away and they wanted to help us set up this DNA network so that we could make identifications, but the system that had been set up was not geared toward making identifications in a mass disaster.",
        "It's geared toward identifying people who are in jail and who have left samples at crime scenes.",
        "So it doesn't--it didn't do the kinds of things that I wanted to have done and--or needed to have done.",
        "And so we had a meeting and we talked about these things and the best ways to get it done.",
        "And the FBI had their way--what they thought was the way to do it and we had--we learned that really wasn't the best way to go about it.",
        "And we found that to be true.",
        "Getting the terrorists' DNA was another issue.",
        "It just took like a year to get it done and I could never understand why.",
        "Maybe they had to go out and go to the places where these people lived and actually collect samples and that took time.",
        "But I just don't know what took so long.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "1 (800) 989-8255 is our number.",
        "What kind of samples did you have to work with?",
        "Were there a lot of tiny fragments?",
        "Were they big body parts?",
        "What were the majority of them?",
        "Well, they were both.",
        "We had, I think, 200 and some fairly intact bodies.",
        "These were torsos, top and bottom torsos, arms.",
        "We had arms, we had legs, we had feet, we had hands, we had heads.",
        "But the vast majority of the pieces were very small, like an inch of a bone or just some tissue, things like that.",
        "You said that when you worked with bones even you, the grizzled forensic expert, had trouble with that."

        "As you just said, it--the day after day was extremely draining but I also found it a tremendous opportunity to help other people in one of the most vulnerable positions anyone could be.",

        "There was a great sensitivity.",

        "Strike leader Aye Phyo Khing says they barely get any time for bathroom breaks.",
        "The role of the attorneys--the Chief Medical Examiners Office I guess was technically our client--we were interviewing the families, helping them establish through sworn testimony that the loved one was missing and there was no body, had, in fact, died at the World Trade Center.",
        "So we were the ones who were helping them track down, apart from the DNA evidence, enough information for the family to go to court without a body and demon--prove to the court there was a--their loved one had died so they could go through the other necessary paperwork.",
        "It was--I mean, just listening to you speak, has brought a lot of tears and, again, I just wanted to say thank you.",
        "It was a wonderful opportunity and there was a lot of compassion, a lot of hard, hard dedication that went on for months and months and months to do as complete a job as possible for all those people."
