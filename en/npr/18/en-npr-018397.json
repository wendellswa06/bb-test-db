        "They called them PUCs--P-U-Cs--people under control.",
        "They talked about making them exercise in the ferocious heat to the point where the detainee would just simply pass out.",
        "There was one incident that's highlighted in this report and it talks about how one of the soldiers who was a cook actually beat a detainee with a baseball bat and it broke the detainee's legs.",
        "And now what's interesting about that and so many of the incidents here is that it seemed in one sense that they were beating and abusing these detainees to get information out of them, intelligence out of them, but on the second hand, they were doing it just to pass time, just to release some of their frustrations, you know, that build up, you know, sitting out at the base or having to go out on patrol.",
        "And the other thing that's very interesting about this is these incidents all took place before and during all the incidents that came to light out of Abu Ghraib and the investigation that was going on at that time.",
        "You know, the report says even though, you know, it's always been--the administration has always said, `This is just the work of a few rogue soldiers,' Human Rights Watch actually questions that because again here we have another situation away from Abu Ghraib where this sort of abuse is taking place.",
        "Now how authoritative is this report?",

        "So the other thing that's very interesting about this report is that the captain, he tried--he says in the--the information that he gave Human Rights Watch, that he tried for 17 months--you know, he approached his chain of command both civilian and military and nothing was done and it was only when he was starting to take the information to two senior members--with the Senate Armed Services Committee, that's when, you know, the Army decided it was going to look into it.",
        "Now has the military, the Army responded?",
        "Well, the Army says it is now looking into all these allegations right now, and so they'll do that.",
        "And the Army has always said, `Lookit, we take any credible allegations and we investigated them.",
        "In fact, you know, they have investigated 300 criminal investigations and, you know, dozens of people have been disciplined, but, you know, nobody higher than very low-level soldiers have ever been really disciplined in this and that's always been one of these things that have really stuck with people because all the investigations and inquiries have been done by either the military, so the military investigating the military, or by a panel that was, you know, brought on by the military.",
