        "...and the sad part might be, they don't get much out of it because they only think of praying when they need something.",
        "Well, I wrote a prayer - an original prayer - in the Help section that says, \"\"Hello - sort of bitterly.",
        "I feel really doomed.",
        "I'm out of good ideas.",
        "It's all hopeless, but I was wondering if possibly, you might step into this mess.\"\" And - so that a lot of the time, we don't know, when we're surrendering, that we're actually at the same time, maybe establishing connection or - like a telephone call, to a power greater than ourselves; or something in the next concentric circle out, whose name is not \"\"me.",
        "So that, to me, is where help begins.",
        "And you know, we're often ashamed of asking for so much help because it seems selfish or petty or narcissistic.",
        "But I think if there's a God - and I believe there is - that God is there to help.",
        "That's what God's job is.",
        "Of the many ways in this book that you describe what prayer is, there's one section - which I'd like you to read - where you speak of prayer as our real selves trying to communicate with the real.",
        "Yeah, or what the Greeks called the really real.",
        "(LAUGHTER) Do you want me to read it?",
        "Yeah.",
        "(Reading) Light reveals us to ourselves, which is not always so great if you find yourself in a big, disgusting mess, possibly of your own creation.",
        "But like sunflowers, we turn toward light.",
        "Light warms, and in most cases, it draws us to itself.",
        "And in this light, we can see beyond shadow and illusion, to something beyond our modest receptors to what is way beyond us, and deep inside.",
        "That is a pretty compelling definition of prayer.",
        "Well, thank you.",
        "Let's go to your second essential prayer, which you call Thanks."

        "Yes.",
        "Thanks is the prayer of relief that there - that help was on the way; that either the cavalry arrived, or that the plates of the earth shifted and that somehow, you got your sense of humor back; or you avoided the car that was right in front of you, that you looked about to hit.",
        "And so it could be the pettiest, dumbest thing.",
        "But it could also be that you get the phone call that the diagnosis was much, much, much better than you had been fearing.",
        "And you say - the full prayer, in its entirety, is thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.",
        "But for reasons of brevity, I just refer to it as Thanks.",
        "Hmm.",
        "...shared it with the colleagues that you could reach.",
        "It can't possibly happen because in the Big Twelve, which along with the Southeastern Conference are the two conferences that will decide the national championship, Oklahoma got into tomorrow's championship game against Missouri as a result of the fifth tie-breaker - which was the BCS poll.",
        "A computer, in other words, decided that Oklahoma would get to play in this game over Texas and Texas Tech, even though Texas beat Oklahoma during the regular season on a neutral field, and had the same record as Oklahoma.",
        "So, the answer to that question, in my long-winded way, is no.",
        "OK.",
        "But if Oklahoma loses tomorrow, would that mean that Texas gets to play for the national title?",
        "Very possibly, it could - although it's not a guarantee.",
        "Again, USC plays a game tomorrow; Texas does not play a game tomorrow.",
        "It's possible the computer might move USC past Texas, and then USC would get to play the winner of Florida-Alabama in the national championship game as opposed to Texas.",
        "So, we just don't know and again, the sad thing is much of this will not be decided on the football field.",
        "OK.",
        "What about the other BCS bowl games?",
        "Is it confusion there, too?",
        "Total confusion, as usual.",
        "One team from a non-BCS conference - there are six BCS conferences - will be in one the BCS bowls.",
        "That's Utah, they're guaranteed a spot; they're 12 and 0.",
        "But Boise State is also undefeated from a non-BCS conference, and I'm willing to bet you a lot of money that on Sunday, they're going to say Ohio State, with a 10 and 2 record out of a BCS conference, gets to go to one of the big bowls over Boise State, even though Ohio State didn't beat a quality opponent all year.",
        "That's not computers, that's politics.",
        "Now, there are people who would defend BCS, in fact, support it.",
        "Is there a quick way for you to explain why the BCS schools refused to adopt a playoff system, why they like this whole system?",
        "There's a very quick way - money.",
        "They don't want to share the money with the rest of Division I - that the non-BCS schools or with the smaller schools in Division II and Division III, and Division 1AA of the NCAA.",
        "Ninety-five percent of the BCS money goes to the 66 BCS schools right now.",
        "Those presidents don't want to share the wealth, even though they're remarkably short-sighted because not only would a playoff system be fairer to the players, but it would ultimately make them more money because a playoff, even though they'd have to spread the money out, would probably be worth two or three times what the BCS is currently worth."
