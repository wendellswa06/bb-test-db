        "A different scenario played out among the women voters.",
        "Earlier in the day, a poll watcher in the woman's section whispered that she'd seen poll workers pointing out who to vote for then pointing to their palms to indicate a payment would be made.",
        "But three other women, there on behalf of three different candidates, were adamant they'd never seen such a thing.",
        "Here's how poll watcher Rahima explained what might've happened.",
        "(Foreign language spoken) (Through translator) Most of the women are uneducated and illiterate.",
        "And if they can't find their favorite candidate on the ballot, poll workers are allowed to point that candidate out.",
        "These women usually have a picture, and you match that with the picture on the ballot so they can cast their vote.",
        "These poll watchers were veiled, of course, but happy to pose for a group photo.",
        "And when another woman joked: Now the Taliban can track you down and then she ran her finger across her neck, Rahima just laughed.",
        "You see, we're sisters, she said, and if the Taliban get one, there's still one of us left.",
        "And those were some of the concerns at polling stations in Kabul on Saturday's election day.",
        "Early reactions to the vote ran the gamut.",

        "It is quite a miracle that the elections took place.",
        "In Afghanistan, during the worst possible timing, in the middle of a major conflict, around four million people - in spite of the threats and in spite of everything - decided to go to vote, men and women, which meant also that they believe in the outcome.",
        "how credible these elections will be.",
        "Well, first of all, we need to wait and see.",
        "Second, these elections are going to be scrutinized by the Afghans themselves to begin with.",
        "De Mistura says another key improvement this time around were the election observers, like the ones we just heard from.",
        "392,000 observers.",
        "And therefore, each of them are watching each other in order to be able to see whether they could become elected.",
        "And that's, in a way, a more stringent guarantee than having international observers.",
        "We may not speak the language.",
        "We may be blind.",
        "But when there are so many, and they're all defending each other's candidates, then in a way, it is quite a guarantee that there will be much more scrutiny.",
        "That's all I'm saying.",
        "There are still other issues about corruption, candidates who are tied to drugs or illegal activities who were running.",
        "They weren't weeded out.",
        "In fact, a lot of talk of a lot of vote buying, which something wouldn't show up at the polls in an obvious way.",
        "How concerning is that to you?"

        "So what we are hoping is that since the process has improved - frankly, everybody's acknowledging this - might give us the opportunity of seeing some progress even among that issue that you raised.",
        "Do you see, as some people have suggested, that this particular election is a key indicator of how well this government is functioning, and whether it can survive when international forces start pulling out?",
        "Well, it is an important step, but not the crucial one.",
        "The crucial one will be whether the government is able to deliver what the people need.",
        "But the elections are important.",
        "They are a test of whether people believe in ballots rather than bullets.",

        "Well, what I would say is simply that everyone, I believe, was a loser in that election, including the international community's credibility.",
        "Lessons were learned, but the real test comes now.",
        "How will the complaints be looked at?",
        "How strongly the electoral commission and the complaints commission will be able to resist pressures, we will see that.",
