        "It's commonly assumed that men who commit sexual assault made a one-time bad decision maybe clouded by too much drinking.",
        "But one person who has studied campus rape says that assumption is wrong, dangerously wrong.",
        "The NPR investigative team worked with journalists at the Center for Public Integrity to look at the problem of sexual assault on campus.",
        "NPR's Joseph Shapiro has this report.",
        "Most of what we know about men who commit rape comes from studying the ones who are in prison.",
        "But most rapes are never reported or prosecuted.",
        "So David Lisak of the University of Massachusetts, Boston, wanted to interview what he calls undetected rapists - the men who are never charged or convicted.",
        "He found them by asking some 2,000 men in college questions like this...",
        "Have you ever had sexual intercourse with someone, even though they did not want to, because they were too intoxicated to resist your sexual advances?",
        "About one in 16 men answered yes to this or similar questions.",
        "You might think it would be hard for a researcher to get these men to admit to something that fits the definition of rape.",
        "But Lisak, a psychologist who studies rapists, says it's not.",
        "They are very forthcoming.",
        "And, in fact, they're eager to talk about their experiences.",
        "They're quite narcissistic as a group - the offenders - and they view this as an opportunity, essentially, to brag.",
        "What Lisak found was that students who commit rape on a college campus are pretty much like those rapists in prison.",
        "In both groups, many are serial rapists.",
        "On college campuses, these repeat predators account for nine out of every 10 rapes."

        "Stetson University law professor Peter Lake agrees that there are plenty of predators on campus, and that it's important to spot them and get them out of school.",
        "But Lake says there's a problem the predator theory underestimates: that's the amount of drinking and sex that's become common with many - although certainly not all - college students.",
        "It's very common for them to go out, drink fairly heavily and hook up sexually with people that they may not know particularly well.",
        "So you have a lot of sexual activity.",
        "You have alcohol.",
        "You have a population that's sort of an at-risk age, and it's in some ways, the perfect storm for sexual assault issues.",
        "Lake, who's written about the evolution of school disciplinary procedures, says that as a result, most schools address sexual assault mainly as a violation of conduct codes.",
        "Having done discipline for 10 years myself, hands-on - I was our honor-code investigator for almost 10 years - what surprised me was how many people have made terrible mistakes and can actually learn to be better people from that, that there still is a chance for teachable moments.",
        "But David Lisak, the psychologist, says schools put too much faith in teachable moments when they ought to treat sexual assault as a criminal matter.",
        "These are clearly not individuals who are simply in need of a little extra education about proper communication with the opposite sex.",

        "Yes, has says, it's stopped, you know, a potential catastrophe of kind of a run on a banks, but - look, we're just in a new reality now where lending is going to be tighter.",
        "I think we will eventually be lending at somewhat lower rates, but not totally lower rates.",
        "I think we all learned a lesson here that if you make risky loans, there's a chance that they could default.",
        "So in a sense, there's a reason for them to be scared?",
        "That's the question.",
        "Are they being rationally scared or are they being more scared than the situation merits?",
        "So, what about the government?",
        "How is it deciding which banks get the help and which don't?",
