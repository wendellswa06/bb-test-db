        "So, the government is not disclosing the names of banks that it turns away and it's not laying out how it's making the decisions, even though these are sort of life or death decisions for some of these banks.",
        "Some of what could happen, and you're starting to maybe see this now, is that the stronger banks will use the money to buy up weaker banks.",

        "Right.",
        "So the argument is that, this is actually what needs to happen and this makes the whole systems stronger you get.",
        "The banks that are healthy will take over the banks that are having trouble, and that's what they are, - or should happen.",
        "Well, lets go back to what a lot of folks thought that the bailout was going to do and the original plan was to buy up the actual toxic assets, what about that plan?",
        "The Treasury says that's still on the table.",
        "Remember the basic idea was that, there are bunch of mortgage-backed securities, all these things out there in the system that depend at some level on mortgages, and those things are all in trouble, so that's what we call toxic assets.",
        "And the government's solution was originally to just buy those up, take those up everybody's hands and say, OK, it's all right.",
        "Don't worry about it.",
        "We got them.",
        "But the government is now saying that's on the table but Treasury won't say they're definitely going to do it.",
        "When the government spends this money, what does it actually do?",
        "I mean, I'm thinking it doesn't write a check.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, I do have this image of a guy there with a pen.",
        "But it's all electronic.",
        "It's actually done through the bank of New York Mellon Corporation, which oddly enough is one of the banks that itself is getting some of the stabilization money.",
