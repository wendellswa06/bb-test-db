        "And the opponents argued that it would not save money elsewhere.",
        "So, Newhouse and his co-researchers went back and studied what happened when people got the new drug benefit.",
        "They looked at people who had no drug coverage before, and they looked at people who had just some, but not very much drug coverage.",
        "Both groups started spending more on medications.",
        "But both groups also spent less on going to doctors and hospitals.",
        "Newhouse says these people got access to preventive care.",
        "That kept them healthy, and it ended up saving Medicare money.",
        "Actually, the very first morning we heard somebody with a sledgehammer kind of systematically pounding on the roof looking for pockets and we just - we were starting to scream and to shout.",
        "It was probably around -let's see, it was light - maybe at six or seven.",

        "So we yelled to the person, there's eight of us and we're hurt.",

        "And I think that night, we were pretty down.",
        "I mean, we were just like, why didn't they come back or why didn't they just at least come back to tell us we've heard you, we're coming or anything?",
        "It just -they just left and we heard nothing else.",
        "So you were there for two nights.",

        "But really, I was actually dragged by my feet through about two feet of the barrier that had been encapsulating me.",
        "And so, they pulled me out once and then I went through another barrier.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
