        "That's Ira Loss, senior health-care analyst with Washington Analysis Corporation, a research firm.",
        "He says the pharmaceutical industry in general has had trouble developing a pipeline of new promising drugs, including Wyeth.",
        "Development of these things takes a lot longer than initially anticipated in almost every case.",
        "And merging won't necessarily solve both companies' problems.",
        "Pfizer had to pull tests on a cholesterol drug in development, and its profits plummeted last quarter as it settled litigation related to marketing of its pain drug, Bextra.",
        "But Wyeth has drugs to treat arthritis and vaccines to prevent meningitis.",
        "And Wyeth also has a consumer products business with brands such as Advil and ChapStick.",
        "Pfizer just exited that business two years ago when it sold its consumer products division to Johnson & Johnson.",
        "That, Ira Loss says, proved to be a mistake because even in bad times, consumers buy those products.",
        "Daniel Ruppar is a pharmaceutical analyst for Frost & Sullivan, a research firm.",
        "He says business-wise, the merger makes sense which is why Pfizer got a hard-won loan to complete the deal.",
        "Ruppar also says this deal may spur a fresh round of drug company mergers following the last wave nearly a decade ago, and that could spell major changes for the industry.",
        "So you have to ask that question - is what's good for their business good for the drug development industry over all?",
        "Ruppar says likely not.",
        "He says creating bigger pharmaceutical giants could make it harder for smaller companies to get support to develop newer drugs, and less diversity and development could mean fewer new breakthroughs in the future.",
        "Both Pfizer and Wyeth dispute that.",
        "They say by combining, they'll be able to bring new drugs to market faster while saving money on overhead.",
        "The deal is expected to close later this year.",

        "Hans Island isn't much of an island.",
        "It's the size of four or five football fields and sits about 600 miles south of the North Pole.",
        "There are no fish and no valuable minerals to speak of and it is hundreds of miles north of where even the hardiest Inuit have ever lived.",
        "Hans Island is so small that at Toronto's main library, in the map department, librarian David Kotin couldn't really find it.",
        "So he pulled out the relevant maps.",
        "OK.",
        "Still, he had to check a Gazetteer for the coordinates, then code and scan once again for this controversial bit of the Arctic.",
        "And here is the Kennedy Channel and here's Hans Island.",

        "Of course, he did point out it was a Canadian map.",
        "The Danes insist that Hans is theirs.",
        "Even though it sits on the Canadian side of the border that Canada and Denmark agreed to in border negotiations in 1973, the ownership of Hans and other small islands was left unsettled.",
        "In July, Canada's defense minister, Bill Graham, visited Hans Island.",
        "Soldiers raised a flag and built an inukshuk, which is a traditional statue made from stone that the native Inuit once used to guide their way across the Arctic.",
        "If the soldiers follow tradition, they also left a bottle of Canadian whiskey for their Danish counterparts.",
        "The visit raised the hackles of the Danish government, who sent a diplomatic protest note, but the affair was treated as a bit of a joke by many Canadians, including writer Jennifer Amy(ph), who built a Web site, Hans Island Liberation Front, mocking the whole business.",
        "There was a flag and then there was some rocks, and I heard that both sides had built inukshuks and that's when I thought this is ridiculous, like, this is just funny.",
        "It's just too comical to be true; a war fought by building inukshuks.",
        "Letters in the Daily Globe and Mail newspaper, written with tongue firmly in cheek, suggested that Danes didn't have to fear persecution in Canada.",
        "Another suggested renaming the danish the Freedom Bun(ph).",
        "But there is a serious side to this.",
        "While the territory represented by Hans Island is not that important, the Canadian government wants to remind the world that its Arctic islands and surrounding water are Canadian.",
        "There are very real border disputes with the US in the western Arctic and those disagreements involve large amounts of oil and gas.",

        "will take some small steps now, letting international development agencies come here and assess the country's needs.",
        "For decades, the choices of this country's leaders kept it apart from the global economy and the community of nations.",
        "Today, the United States is prepared to respond to reforms with measured steps to lessen the isolation, and to help improve the lives of its citizens."
