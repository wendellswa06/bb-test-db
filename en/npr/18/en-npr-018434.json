        "Yeah.",

        "No, nothing.",

        "And I know Alan Alda is going to talk about that, and I took a workshop with him about communicating science.",
        "And I think, you know, it's a matter of A) finding what's personal about it, B) understanding yourself, and C) connecting with your audience.",
        "So the only thing we did was find visual ways to explain the same concept.",
        "So you know, the scene where she's at a party and she uses elements on the bar to explain her research with, you know, X and Y chromosomes and, you know, audiences get it.",
