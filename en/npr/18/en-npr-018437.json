        "It's good to be with you.",

        "Now, one of the things that we're going to do about the screening program is we're going to allow - use the option of having a questionnaire if the caseworker suspects that you could be on drugs.",
        "Now, it says random drug-testing, that doesn't mean that everybody's going to be tested.",
        "It's only somebody they suspect that might be on drugs, and then they're going to do a questionnaire.",
        "And that means that they may not have to be urine tested - or a blood test.",

        "And if they come back and they test positive again, then I'll give them another 14 days, I believe it is.",
