        "So I think it's legitimate for society to say look, you've caused us a problem, we arrested you for drunk driving, we now insist that you go into the drug-court system, and we're going to drug-test you.",
        "I don't think that having a drug-testing program that's a bar to entry to welfare or food stamps makes sense where you don't tie it to effective drug treatment.",
        "And even then, I'd want to see some probability that you exhibited drug behavior before I test you.",
        "Now, my bill does say that you have to go to a program.",

        "And I've been a recipient of federal aid in the past, and I am no longer, and had I been subject to drug tests at the time, I might not have gotten the assistance to my family that I needed.",

        "And let me put part of his question to you, Representative Napier, and that is if - does your program test for alcohol and alcoholism?",
        "No, I don't think the test is for alcohol, but I'm not opposed to that, and also I'd like to say this: I'm considering putting an amendment to this bill and saying that all members of the General Assembly be drug-tested.",
