        "Not only did you suck the air out of the scandal that dominated the political news coverage, but you and pigs provided some much-needed comic relief from this increasingly nasty, vacuous, money-driven excuse for a presidential campaign.",
        "Marsha Carpenter from Red Rock, Pennsylvania, was one of several listeners who wrote in to suggest one other approach to analyze the political usage of this barnyard metaphor.",
        "Loved your story and also the attempt by Joel Salatin to apply lipstick to a pig in order to give credence to the assumption that a pig is a pig is a pig.",
        "Carpenter continues, however, I was somewhat amazed that you didnt contact the only longtime lipstick-wearing pig that I can think of, Miss Piggy herself.",
        "She would probably have much porcine wisdom to impart on the subject.",
        "And Teresa Pasco(ph) of Birkenfeld, Oregon, wrote in with an anecdote: Your pig farmer was not the first.",
        "Last year, she writes, my husband and I were overheard commenting about putting lipstick on a pig by our recently adopted eight year old.",

        "I'm never sure we were at bipartisanship, but that's where he wants to go back to.",
        "Yes, it is an odd word given the very hard press that was made by this newly-elected governor to achieve much of his agenda in the early weeks of his first legislative session.",

        "He does want to talk about cooperation.",
