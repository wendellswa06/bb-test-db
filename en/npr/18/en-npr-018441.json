        "We're getting some results from redistricting.",
        "Most places, of course, every 10 years people's district lines are redrawn for Congress by state legislatures and governors for the most part.",
        "As you know in many places, there is some vicious, vicious battles.",
        "In some places, there are commissions.",
        "That's supposed to make it a bipartisan effort.",
        "And you expect these fights.",
        "This is the most partisan political exercise you can possibly conduct.",
        "Some interesting, though, John Conyers, who has been in Congress I think forever, got districted out of his seat.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "That's right.",
        "He's been there since 1964, nearly half a century, representing Detroit in the main, and is iconic, of course, in terms of the politics of the city of Detroit, African-American politics there.",
        "His new district is 80 percent different from his old district.",
        "He's only got about one voter in five of the ones who voted for him in 2010, and people that have been added to his district are from largely Republican suburbs, including some of the Grosse Pointe communities, which are well-known and affluent communities in Michigan and the Midwest.",
        "So this would appear to be the death knell for John Conyers, and there is going to be an effort, in all likelihood, to challenge this map in the courts.",
        "One of the longest-serving members of Congress.",
        "In the meantime, the newest member of Congress also got redistricted.",
        "Yes, interesting.",
        "The number-two-long-serving person in Congress, John Conyers, and the very, very newest, Janice Hahn in Los Angeles.",
        "She just got elected a few - matter of weeks ago, really.",
        "And she is already finding herself drawn into a district with another Democratic incumbent.",
        "Now, California isn't losing a lot of seats, or gaining seats, either, for that matter, but because they have this new commission, as you mentioned, they're no longer drawing the districts to protect the incumbents the way the state legislature and the governor and some of the other people involved in these maps in the past have done.",
        "So with this new commission drawing communities of interest, you're bound to see some incumbents drawn together, and that includes Janice Hahn.",
        "So she's got a decision to make there."

        "And you expect these battles in places as complicated as California, even with a commission.",

        "This goes back, none dare call it treason.",
        "Or Delaware or Montana, where they just have the one seat.",
        "And in Maine, where they have two, they are wrangling largely over whether to draw it vertically or horizontally.",
        "Now, in fact, there is a partisan difference here.",
        "There's a new commission there.",
        "But it's evenly split, and they've got very different ideas about how to draw it.",
        "And the Republicans would like to put the two current Democratic members, who have the two seats for the state of Maine in the same district, creating of course a vacancy, and then pitting the two Democrats against each other in a primary.",
        "Unless one of them should move.",
        "But that's another - so instead of drawing the state horizontally, dividing it north-south into two districts, they would draw it vertically east-west, and that would put both Democrats on the coastal district.",
        "That's correct, although of course there is still a certain amount of verticality or horizontality, no matter how you do it.",
        "But the point is that most of the people are towards the sea coast and nearer to the south than way up north.",
        "We'll pay more attention to those as they continue to develop.",
        "In the meantime, we're going to be talking with Michael Gerson of the Washington Post about the Republican presidential field when we come back in the next segment.",
        "But there is the Democratic candidate as well, and that is Barack Obama, who set out - essentially this kicks off his campaign, this bus tour through the Midwest, as he followed the Ames Straw Poll.",
        "That's right, flew into Minnesota, went down to Iowa, over to Illinois.",
        "He is trying to sort of send the signal that he still remembers his days as a candidate, when he was starting out in the Iowa caucuses contest of 2007-2008, trying to stay closer to some of those more populist moments in his career.",
        "It's harder to do when you're president of the United States and when your economy is somewhat at sea, when unemployment is over 9 percent, and when your own personal popularity numbers have just slipped down under 40 percent in the Gallup for the first time.",
        "Of course still three times higher than the popularity figures for Congress, but that's another issue."

        "Everybody held up their hand and said no. The president had this to say.",

        "This is a president who, while he might have wanted at one time to think of himself as a consensus builder and tried to build bridges between the parties, has found himself, by a combination of the behavior of his own party and certainly by the resistance of the other party, cast in a rather partisan mode at the moment.",
        "We are asking callers to tell us the strengths and weaknesses of the president.",
        "A tweet from Jamie(ph): Obama's Achilles' heel is reconvincing us of his message.",
        "His base wants him to fight, not compromise, even if he doesn't win.",
        "And he's said to be preparing a package for a major speech in early September that will propose, yes, revenue increases and says it's not possible to make the cuts we need without revenue increases.",

        "I'm a small-business owner, and I like pragmatists.",
        "I think it's also his weakness because he has to work with extremely unpragmatic people who are only interested in hearing their own voices and their own campaigns.",
        "And so I think that it's a possible problem for him in getting re-elected because people are - my fellow Americans are very reactionary, and they're not listening enough to pragmatism.",

        "And Ron, I think that's what a lot of Republican candidates are banking on.",
        "That's right, and that is, I think, a factor in why Republicans feel that they can go for someone at this point who is a very strong partisan figure, somebody who is not necessarily seen as a compromiser, someone who is not going to tack back to the center but someone who would remain true to the core principles of the party all the way through.",
