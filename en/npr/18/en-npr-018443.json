        "And people look at the narrowness of the lead that Mitt Romney has in these public opinion polls in any case and say, boy, Rick Perry managed to come from a lot further back and demolish Kay Bailey Hutchison, a much more mainstream Republican.",
        "He's a very tough candidate.",
        "I do think, though, that there a lot of talk among mainstream conservatives now about someone else getting in the race because there's a lack of comfort with Perry or - and with Bachmann.",
        "And people talk about Paul Ryan.",
        "People talk about Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey.",
        "You know, so I think we're still a little bit unsettled because there's not a broad, you know, happiness with the field itself.",
        "Ron Elving, Paul Ryan talked because the chairman of the budget committee asked the speaker of the House, John Boehner, to not put him on the supercommittee.",
        "But I really emphasize that science is an unending quest.",
        "As it advances, its frontier gets longer and new questions come into focus that we couldn't even have posed before.",
        "I think it's fair to say that Paul Ryan has receded somewhat as a face in the Republican Party in the House and this whole summer with the whole crisis over the debt ceiling and so on.",
        "He was rarely front and center until the actual night of the final vote when he urged his colleagues to vote for the compromise.",
        "He, I think, has come to be - for better, for worse - synonymous with the idea of ending Medicare as we know it and making it a premium support program, a largely private insurance program, and that has not been terribly popular from a political standpoint.",
        "Might be a viable solution down the road, might be part of any long-term deficit reduction, but not very immediately politically popular.",
        "So he seems to have receded a bit.",
        "It's not clear that he's the answer, especially because he's personally saying not at this point in my life - young family, haven't raised any money and so on.",
        "And the idea of taking on Rick Perry at this particular juncture does not look very attractive.",
        "It's Wednesday.",
        "The political junkie is with - well, actually, he's in the ocean somewhere...",
        "Bobbing the waves.",

        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And here's a couple of tweets.",
        "Matt tweets: As a more pragmatic and less social conservative, I am more concerned with the electability of a candidate.",
        "Marcus tweets: I choose electability over purity.",
        "One of the candidates has to appeal to the middle if the GOP is going to defeat Obama.",
        "And that's really a concern, that a candidate in the primary election would box themselves into positions that would cede the political middle to Barack Obama."

        "No.",
        "Obviously, a party can choose a purist, like George McGovern, or they could choose someone like Bill Clinton.",
        "And they, you know, parties do both of those things, and they either strengthen or weaken their approach.",
        "So I do think though that you eventually do get more of a focus on electability in this process.",
        "After all, John McCain, who was not very popular with conservatives, won the last time around.",
        "Iowa, where everyone is focused right now, and where Bachmann wins, is not really typical of the Republican Party.",
        "It's really dominated by religious conservatives.",
        "It has been for quite some time.",
        "And so I think that this - as the primaries broaden, you know, there will be a more of an argument here about the future of the party.",

        "Sure.",
        "I think that a Republican candidate who runs on true conservative principles will instantly become electable.",
        "Even if that cedes the independent voters in the middle?",
        "I don't think the independent voters are going to drift back to the left side of the political spectrum.",
        "Why not?",
        "Well, I think they've had a little taste of that, and they've seen the results.",
        "And I think while they're certainly not ready to join the Tea Party, I think they are drifting and leaning to the right.",

        "I think it's certainly true that President Obama has lost support among independents since his own election last time around.",
        "And that's an opportunity for Republicans.",
        "But any presidential candidate, this is simplistic but it's generally true, that any presidential candidate wins by motivating his base while simultaneously reaching out to the middle.",

        "That's what George Bush did perfectly in his first election.",

        "Last week, we - Ron Elving - said you could have in the first three contests - Iowa, New Hampshire and then South Carolina - three different winners in the Republican field.",
        "Maybe Michele Bachmann, who did well in the straw poll, maybe Mitt Romney, who has a strong base in New Hampshire, and then maybe Rick Perry in South Carolina.",
        "Super Tuesday doesn't exist with the same power as it used to.",
        "Could you see this battle extending into June?",
        "Well, if that battle extends in that fashion, I think that Romney would be pretty happy about that.",
        "If both Bachmann and Perry remain in this race and fight it out for Tea Party and conservative support, that's probably to the benefit of Romney.",
        "I think his concern is whether you have one candidate, whether Rick Perry, in particular, can unite Tea Party support with movement - conservative broader movement, conservative support - and really make a major challenge to the Republican establishment.",
        "That wouldn't be a foregone conclusion.",
        "If it's a two-person race in that way, which I'm not convinced it will be, but if it were, that would be much more problematic.",

        "That's correct.",
        "The - a heart attack is, in essence, a cessation of blood flow to an area of heart muscle.",
        "What happens when that blood flow is abruptly stopped for a period of 20 minutes or greater, the heart muscle cells die, and the healing process is one of scar formation.",
        "So similar to the scar you get in your skin when you cut it, a scar like that forms in the heart, and it's intended to repair the damage.",
        "But of course scar tissue isn't like muscle, and so the scar can't contract, and permanent damage is caused to the heart muscle.",
        "And then heart failure might kick in.",
        "Right, so when you have a scar that's big enough, the term that we use in medicine, which is a term most people are familiar with, is remodeling.",
        "So the scar tissue causes the heart to blow up by - like a balloon.",
        "Another analogy that people will recognize is that the normal heart is shaped like a football, and the failing heart, after a heart attack has occurred in the heart, becomes shaped like a soccer ball or a basketball.",
        "It becomes rounded.",
        "And so it doesn't work as well.",
        "It doesn't work as well.",
        "And that leads to two very, very common medical problems that afflict us in our society: congestive heart failure and a problem called sudden cardiac death, where the heart just abruptly stops beating, for electrical reasons usually.",
        "And so that heart attack leads to a whole host of other very, very serious medical problems.",
        "And once you get this misshapen heart, there's really not much that we can normally do for it, is there?",
        "Correct.",
        "The - so the approach to heart attack currently is to try and restore the blood flow as quickly as possible.",
        "And there's an expression: time is a heart muscle.",
        "So that's why when you - when folks are having heart attacks, we rush them into the cardiac catheterization laboratory to open that blood vessel as quickly as possible."
