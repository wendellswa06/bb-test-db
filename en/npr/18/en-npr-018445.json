        "And that's when the problem was created.",
        "Everything they've done since then can't undo that problem.",
        "You report that even up to this year, the town was planning an expansion of more than 20 percent.",
        "Yes.",
        "They wanted to put in senior citizen housing that would have had a lot of new residents.",
        "It doesn't seem like anyone was saying, hey, if we grow this population, we might not be able to get out in case of an emergency.",
        "There was a grand jury report after the 2008 fire that called for that kind of discussion with any new development that goes into Paradise.",

        "After all the research you've done, what's the biggest lesson that you take away from what happened in Paradise?",
        "Well, there's a lot of discussion about forestry management and building hardened homes and early warning systems.",
        "Those are the three things that are talked about a lot in California.",
        "But I think there's a need to take a lesson from hurricane states like Florida.",
        "Those are states that have already dealt with this and addressed the need for evacuation any time they do zoning or growth plans.",
        "And that's not been done in California yet.",
        "There's a note in this 2008 grand jury report about Paradise's looming disaster.",

        "And particularly when you think about the allegation that Dr. Ford has made where she has - you know, where this letter was leaked after the FBI investigation, after, you know, he answered 1,300 questions by the committee and sat for over 30 hours of questioning, yeah, I can see how he does not think that this has been a fair process.",
        "Let me ask you - Kavanaugh was asked some uncomfortable questions in this interview about his history with heavy drinking.",
        "He also volunteered very private information about his own sexual history, saying he never had sex in high school, even though that is irrelevant to the allegation that's made against him.",

        "Yeah, I do.",
        "I mean, look; again, you know, there has become this presumption of guilt before there's been any real evidence presented - any evidence.",
        "In fact, the people - other folks who were supposed to be able to corroborate these - this allegation - we're talking about the one by Dr. Ford - is they've all come and said either weren't there, didn't see it, didn't - don't know him, never been in a party with him, don't remember it, don't have any recollection.",
        "Although she has her own witnesses and character witnesses who say that she is telling the truth and that this information and this incident had been relayed to them.",

        "Of course, we can all find people who say we're good people.",
        "Although that's exactly what you are doing for Brett Kavanaugh.",
        "You organized a group of women and held a press conference, signed a letter saying I stand with Brett.",
        "But you weren't at that particular party in the 1980s that Christine Blasey Ford was talking about either.",
        "Do you want to expound on that a little?",
        "So I did help organize a group of women, and I think it's important to talk about that.",
        "It's not - it wasn't one person or three people who came up and stood up for Brett.",
        "It was 85 women from every aspect of his life.",
        "And so I think when you get into these situations where, you know, that are 35 years ago and people say one thing that doesn't comport with the way a person has conducted his life over the course of his life, what you have to go on unless someone presents evidence, which has yet to occur, what you have to go on is a character witness.",

        "Is it possible that you don't know?",
        "I don't believe it's possible that I don't know because I believe I know Brett very well.",
        "And we also all know men in our social and professional circles sometimes who we think, well, though, they wouldn't do that or no, that's not - and then you hear something, you think, well, maybe, you know, I guess I can kind of see that.",
        "He's a little angry.",
        "He's a little - that is just not the case here.",
        "And that's, I think, why people who know Brett find this so offensive and shocking.",
        "And, you know, Brett's had to answer a lot of personal questions that he - you know, because of this allegation is now going to have to delve into his very personal details, as you mentioned.",
        "That's part of the process.",
        "He's going to have to do that.",
