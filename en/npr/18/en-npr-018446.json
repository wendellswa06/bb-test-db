        "Next year, the NCAA inaugurates a playoff to decide the national football champion, and that's probably just the beginning.",
        "Many believe we're close to a complete shakeup for super conferences that would abandon the NCAA and make big-time college athletics an even bigger business than it is now.",

        "And numerical sense.",
        "Welcome to the Big Ten, home of 14 schools in a couple of years.",

        "Yeah.",

        "And then you have a school like Rutgers where - which was a member of the Big East.",
        "And for years, people were deriding the fact that they spent so much money on an arena, and it didn't seem like a good use of public funds.",

        "It is, though I've read very good studies saying that a New Yorker will watch a football - a Rutgers football game - basically something like one in 50 New Yorkers have watched Rutgers football.",
        "They are in the New York market and maybe the thinking goes that one day when they start playing teams like Ohio State and Michigan that they'll become a big thing, but as a New Yorker, I could tell you that, you know, Notre Dame is a much bigger football team in the New York market than Rutgers ever is and possibly ever will be.",

        "So as you look at this alignment, these conferences that are emerging as 14 and eventually we think 16-team conferences, there is a lot of thought about these four super conferences that are going to be so powerful they can afford to just blow away the NCAA.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that, you know, this is an idea that's been going on for a while.",
        "In the 1960s, there was talk of UCLA and USC and Alabama and all the big teams of the day getting together in a super conference, and that scared a lot of people.",
        "You know, more or less, what we have now is a few super conferences, and it's really hard to compete with the SEC, which, you know, has champions of college of football for - if Alabama wins, that will be I think five years in a row.",

        "We're going to take a break and come back and talk lots more about science and society and with - and about the 350th anniversary of the Royal Society.",
        "My guests are Sir Martin Rees.",
        "He's the outgoing president of the Royal Society and Britain's astronomer royal - and Richard Holmes, author of \"\"The Age of Wonder\"\" and a fellow of the British Academy.",
        "The way the economics of college basketball, by the way, are, the tournament is worth, you know, $770 million a year to broadcast it.",
        "The tournament drives everything, but regular play is not such an economic engine, whereas college football, any given Saturday, you know, the town of Lincoln, Nebraska, becomes - sorry, the stadium in Lincoln, Nebraska, becomes the third largest city in the state of Nebraska on a football Saturday.",
        "That's always been such, but now, a very strong case can be made that college football is the second favorite sport in America, behind only pro football.",
        "Lots of money there.",
        "And what does this do, though?",
        "Is there any test when schools leave the places that they've been forever, their traditional rivalries, the places - the schools they've played forever, what does that do to do their fan base?"

        "There's also the question of - if the super conferences do break away to get their own lucrative TV deals, even more lucrative TV deals, the NCAA has always had, well, at least a lip service to the idea of the college athlete and certainly in big time sports like football.",
        "Would there be any shred of a fig leaf of protection for college student athletes anymore?",
