        "Yeah.",
        "And, Mike Pesca, the amount of money here is just unreal.",
        "The amount of money is staggering.",
        "But I would say that in the case of Rutgers or Maryland, having to pay exit fees, these are probably rational economic decisions.",
        "If you want to get really indignant, look at what - and this isn't about realignment - but look at what Tennessee has done with its football coaches.",

        "Just last week, he was inducted in the College Football Hall of Fame.",
        "Great coach, but they had to pay him.",
        "They had to pay him over $100,000 a month for four years.",
        "Then, Lane Kiffin was the coach.",
        "He left for USC.",
        "And then they had Derek Dooley as the coach and they just fired him.",

        "They're paying these guys not to coach, about $5 million.",
        "And the University of Tennessee doesn't have the money to cover it.",
        "So the way they're going to pay off these coaches not to coach is that they're not going to give a gift - this is what they call it.",
        "I don't - I'm not an accountant, but it seems like this is a weird way to look at your revenue.",

        "This way, they could cover the cost of buyouts on coach's contracts.",
        "Just last week, Mark Emmert, the president of the NCAA, discussed the escalation of coach's salaries and he says it's unsustainable.",
        "And paying coaches a lot of money, you know, I'm sure Alabama thinks they have a bargain in Nick Saban.",
        "Not everyone earns their money.",
        "But paying coaches a lot of money is one thing.",
        "Paying coaches at a public institution - where money is tight - not to coach, that's the sort of thing that really could - well, I think it could bring right and left together, you know, when...",

        "Hi.",
        "I was calling - I'm a WVU Mountaineer fan.",
        "I grew up in Morgantown, and they moved to the Big 12 this year, and it's been fantastic for me because I finally get to watch games.",
        "Ah, so they've moved back to you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, they're still playing in the Midwest.",

        "They get to see - be seen on many more screens across the country.",
        "That will help with recruiting and, well, on and on it goes, Mike.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And when - I quoted Jim Boeheim and said money and football, the unsaid thing was money and football and television.",
        "And there's a lot of thought that ESPN specifically is driving a lot of this realignment.",
        "The AD, athletic director of Boston College, had to backtrack a year or so ago when he was quoted as saying that ESPN was advising him on telling him what to do, on what conference to be a part of.",
        "So not just television in general, but ESPN certainly likes a lot of this and is driving, you can say, just because they represent a lot of the money in the realignment."

        "Another thing is they're starting all these new networks, like NBC has a foothold, they have a 24-hour sports network.",
        "And what those networks need are inventory, which just means you got to play a lot of games.",
        "So I think the contract in general for conferences, even - not even the biggest conferences will be going up and up and up just because there are new outlets that want to show these games on television.",

        "Yeah.",
        "These are the two best defenses in the country, and that's why I wouldn't pencil anyone in right away as an automatic.",
        "What we saw - Alabama had an escape against Georgia.",
        "And they had really - in the SEC finals, and they really had worn down Georgia's defense.",
        "And that just is not going to happen against Notre Dame.",
        "I do note that the last time Notre Dame played, a couple of weeks ago, and the next time they play, which will be for the championship, that will be an interregnum of 40 days.",
        "And I count, and I think there are nine popes that served for shorter reigns than those 40 days, just to pick a Catholic comparison.",
        "So that's another thing that college football has to look at.",
        "The one thing I think I want to address is it's not like it used to be.",

        "I'm not saying it's corrupt.",
        "There's always been greed.",

        "And it used to be such a brutal sport that Theodore Roosevelt had to come in and essentially start the NCAA because people were getting killed.",

        "Why ballooning?",
        "That's right.",
        "It's a collection.",
        "I think it's 22 essays.",
        "And if I can just say, I mean, they are a wonderful collection: Richard Dawkins, for example; Stephen Jones(ph); Henry Petroski, wonderful engineer - I think from Duke University, a wonderful thing about building bridges; John Barrow(ph), who is a science historian.",
        "A wonderful selection of people.",
        "So my rather eccentric production is about ballooning in the 18th century, and I chose it, first of all, to tell you the truth, because it's such a wonderful subject to write about, the adventure of ballooning, and I love the storytelling element in science.",
        "So that was one of the things that drew me to it.",
        "The second is that it's a very good example of pure science then being applied.",
        "So we're in a period when the air is being analyzed.",
        "It is discovered it's full of what they called artificial gases - nitrogen, for example; or, more relevant, hydrogen, the lighter-than-air gas.",
        "So you have a series of pure experiments both in England, people like Cavendish(ph) and Black; and in France the great Lavoisier.",
        "And they're making these discoveries, and then the question is how do you apply them.",
        "They applied them in different ways.",
        "One was an attempt to cure tuberculosis using nitrous oxide.",
        "But what I followed up was the use of lighter-than-air hydrogen to inflate balloons and then to fly.",
        "And this is the first generation, the first people who ever rose above the Earth.",
        "Astonishing effect.",
        "You have to imagine this, the impact it had, not merely physical but the philosophical implications, being able to rise above a city or to cross water.",
        "They crossed - there was a great race to cross the British Channel.",
        "That's a story I follow very closely.",
        "I should add that the British balloon, which crossed first - the French balloon, I'm afraid, crashed in flames, but the British balloon was actually piloted by two men, one of whom was a Frenchman, Jean-Pierre Blanchard, and the other was American, Dr. John Jeffries - typical example of wonderful combination of science.",
        "So I chose it for those reasons, and finally, just to repeat, I think it's a very good example of where science starts to have social and philosophical implications.",
        "For example: Could ballooning be used in warfare?",
        "Could it revolutionize transport or weight-carrying?",
        "Could it tell us, which it definitely could, something about the upper atmosphere?",
