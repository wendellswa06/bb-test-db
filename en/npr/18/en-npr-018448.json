        "Didn't Ben Franklin weigh in on ballooning himself?",
        "Ben Franklin was marvelous.",
        "He was at this time - we're talking about the 1780s - he was the American ambassador in Paris.",
        "Of course the Brits had been at war with the Americans a little bit previously.",
        "But Benjamin Franklin had very good relations with the Royal Society.",
        "Indeed, he was a member.",
        "Even during the American Revolution?",
        "This - well, that was a little bit earlier.",
        "We're now talking in the 1780s, okay?",
        "But actually, there's an important point here that one of the things that the Royal Society really tried to do was establish international relations despite warfare.",
        "So later on, when the Napoleonic Wars with the French were going on, there was still communication between French and English scientists.",
        "Indeed, Humphrey Davey(ph) actually went to France on a special passport.",
        "Franklin, just back to Franklin, he followed the early (unintelligible), the French ballooning experiments over Paris.",
        "And he wrote brilliant letters to Sir Joseph Banks, who was then the president of the Royal Society over here in London, slightly teasing Joseph Banks, saying you Brits are being a bit slow about this; my French friends are advancing, experimenting, taking great risks; what are the British doing about it?",
        "And there is one wonderful exchange, where Banks writes back and says: We cannot, the Society cannot immediately see the practical applications of ballooning.",
        "This is a form of French ballon-mania(ph).",
        "And Benjamin Franklin replies: Well, sir, I cannot immediately see the practical use of a newborn baby.",
        "A great remark.",
        "That's a great remark.",
        "Martin Rees, your essay in the book asks the question: What will we understand in the year 2060?",
        "Where do you see us in 2060?",
        "Well, yes, my essay is one of the ones looking forward, and of course, we are looking through a very cloudy crystal ball.",
        "And what I say in this essay is that there are some things we can be fairly confident about - for instance, the world will have a bigger population, it'll be warmer.",
        "But we can't predict the technology, because if you just think of the technology change in the last 20 years, we couldn't have predicted the iPhone and its ubiquity 20 years from now.",
        "So we can't predict these things."

        "We might understand the origin of life.",
        "We might, 50 years from now, know where there's life beyond the Earth.",
        "David Durante, let me ask you, as I understand it, your specialty is the pommel horse, is that right?",
        "Well, I think we know that already we have enough scientific knowledge to deal with the grossest poverty in Africa and elsewhere, but we're not doing it.",
        "And therefore I do worry about whether the benefits of globalization and the benefits of the even more advanced technologies we'll develop will be spread around the world.",
        "So I think it is becoming more difficult to ensure that science is optimally applied.",
        "But I think this is why academies are so important, because more and more of the decisions that politicians have to take have a scientific aspect to them, whether it's climate or energy or whether it's the ethical issues in biology et cetera.",
        "And I think it's very important that the decisions on how science is used should not be taken just by scientists, because scientists have no special ethical sensitivities, et cetera, and no special wisdom in economics, et cetera.",
        "But it's very important that those who make the decisions, with(ph) the politicians and all citizens, should be guided by the best science.",
        "And the Royal Society and your National Academy are therefore very concerned to ensure that the best scientific advice is available to our legislators.",
        "What if our legislators don't pay attention to science?",
        "Well, I mean, that is depressing, but I think then we have to go to the media and the public, because one of the reasons why we are concerned about scientific education is not that we want everyone to become a scientist but that people can't really participate in the debate about scientific issues unless they know that a protein and a proton aren't the same thing and unless they have some understanding of basic science.",
        "And so that's why scientific literacy is so important, and that's why we in the Royal Society, who are primarily concerned with sort of university and advanced education, have now not decided that we need to take a greater interest in school-level education.",
        "And I guess in the U.S.",
        "there's a similar concern.",

        "In light of the various anti-intellectual, anti-scientific public strains that we experience today, can we learn anything about how the Royal Society 300 years ago dealt with those issues?",

        "Richard Holmes?",
        "Yes.",
        "I'd answer this slightly from left field way.",
        "In this book, there's a wonderful essay by Margaret Atwood, the Canadian novelist, which is about the mad scientist and how science and scientists have been mocked traditionally, and she looks at it as a literary problem, starting with \"\"Gulliver's Travels\"\" - and some of you out there, I'm sure, will know the famous crazed Grand Academy of Lagado, which exists out there in \"\"Gulliver's Travels,\"\" written in the 1720s, and this society of mad - not scientists but projectors, who were a kind of satire on the Royal Society.",
        "And she follows in this very funny but very acute essay this tradition going up through Mary Shelley's Dr. Frankenstein, another mad doctor, but very interesting because actually in many ways committed, attempting to help mankind.",
        "It goes through do you remember Stevenson's \"\"Dr.",

        "For example, it published a superb document on climate change, engaging with all the problems, looking at possible solutions - a document that would be immensely readable.",

        "My theory was that the two Baconian things, that science should find out the truth, should discover and invent, then science should be - apply for the benefit of mankind - I think there's a third one now, which is science and scientists have a duty to explain what they're doing, to educate the public.",
