        "There's nowhere in space as comfortable as even the top of Everest or the South Pole.",
        "But space exploration will be for adventurers going and accepting high risks and maybe even one-way tickets.",

        "But if we look ahead to several centuries, then we can imagine perhaps terraforming taking place, and then, of course, we get to the post-human era, because we have to think that human beings are going to evolve in future not on the Darwinian time scale but on a much shorter time scale.",
        "And we may imagine that the people who are on Mars and in other places centuries from now, they will be post-humans rather than humans.",
        "As a scientist who's outside the box - and I mean America - how do you look from across the pond and view science in America these days?",
        "Has it seen its best days or its best days behind it?",
        "I would hope not.",

        "is number one in the volume of top-rate science.",
        "There's no doubt about that.",
        "But on the other hand, this is a perplexity to many of us over here that issues like creationism and climate skepticism are far more rampart in the U.S.",
        "than they are anywhere in Europe.",
        "Why do you think that is?",
        "Well, it would be presumptuous for me to comment, really, but I think obviously I know the National Academy feels that there are deficiencies in science teaching at the school level.",
        "We have the same problems over here, but I think in the U.S.",

        "And that's a wonderful overview again of what he calls the Copernican revolution, by which he doesn't just mean that we know the sun is in the middle of the solar system, but why we're beginning to see much more clearly that we are in a very average sort of situation in a suburb of the Milky Way; what are the chances of our average situation being repeated outside to the planets in other systems which might bear life?",
        "He looks into that.",
        "Very interesting.",
        "The Goldilocks problem, the planet that's not too hot, not too warm.",
        "We now know since the mid-1990s there's been - I think it's now about 500 planets outside our own solar system being discovered.",
        "None of them looked exactly promising, but of course the great search is for water in some form, because that seems to be the basic requirement for life.",
        "But also, in this wonderful essay, he looks at what we're discovering on the Earth and under the oceans and so on, about the nature of life, that actually life can live in a sulfuric acid context.",
        "It can live in extreme heat and extreme cold.",
        "So the possibilities of life existing out there are also growing.",

        "So that was, I thought, a rather stupid title that the American publisher gave the book.",
        "But I was really emphasizing the point that the 21st century, which is the - it's the first century after the 45 million centuries which have elapsed on the Earth where one species, namely ours, has control over the entire future.",
        "So what we do as humans this century will determine the entire future of our planet.",
        "And I was concerned with the collective impact we're having on the planet because of our greater number and greater consumption of resources, but also of the possibility of misuse of technology in a disruptive way.",
        "So I was concerned that there are going to be difficult problems because there are more people on the planet having more impact on the environments and more impact by technology.",

        "I mean, there was a very famous question about why is it hotter in the summer than it is in the winter?",
        "I talked about this a lot, asked some Harvard graduates, and 90 percent of them didn't know the answer.",
        "Could that be some of the reasons, or is this just - we don't - just don't some simple science questions?",

        "Well, it is true.",
        "It's depressing that many members of the public don't know what we would think as basic scientific ideas.",

        "I mean, there are many people in America who I'm sure couldn't find Iran or Korea on the map.",
        "Mexico, maybe, but...",
        "Or maybe just about Mexico.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But they couldn't find Korea or Iran or Syria.",
        "And, of course, that's equally depressing, because that, again, means they can't participate properly in political discussions, which are important.",
        "So I think it's just general ignorance that education should try to remove.",
        "And, of course, H.G.",
