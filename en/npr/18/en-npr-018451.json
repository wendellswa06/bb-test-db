        "From NPR News, this is NEWS & NOTES.",
        "I'm Audie Cornish for Farai Chideya.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "It took me almost six years of working on this.",
        "The first two years, of course, I got $200,000 to do a study - a two-year study.",
        "And when that study was completed, I then took the results of that study and went to my sub-committee with it and I convinced them that this was something that needed to be done.",
        "I worked very closely with the members on the other side.",
        "In fact, a staffer on the Republican side, when he saw the bill, he became very enamored with it because his son had just talked to him about Gullah.",
        "And he wanted to know the difference.",
        "And I had to explain to him that it's Gullah in North and South Carolina, and it's Geechee in Florida and Georgia.",
        "But it's all the same culture.",
        "And so using that relationship, I then got it through the House.",
        "It got hung-up in the Senate for almost three years.",
        "And finally, on the last week of the session before coming out, I went to Senator Orrin Hatch.",
        "Senator Hatch is someone who I've gotten to know.",
        "We shared a seat on the plane going out to former President Nixon's funeral.",
        "I had gone out at one time to play in his golf tournament that raises millions of dollars for Utah charities.",
        "And so we have that relationship.",
        "And so I called him.",
        "And I told him that a hold was on this bill.",
        "I needed this bill, that I felt a little bit insulted going back home this year after three years not having it - having gotten it done.",
        "Twenty-four hours later, he called me back and said that he'd consulted with the senator who was holding the bill up and that the bill would be passed that evening.",
        "And that's how it happened, the personal relationship that I had developed.",
        "Yet that must have made you very joyful.",
        "We don't have much time left.",
        "I wanted to actually toss something to Mr. Campbell.",
        "There was a film called Home Across the Water produced in '92 by a frequent NPR contributor, Ben Shapiro.",
        "And it cites Cornelia Bailey, who was raised I guess and born on Sapelo Island, Georgia.",
        "Let's listen to what she has to say.",
        "(Soundbite of movie \"Home Across the Water\")",
        "People come in and said you all need to preserve this just the way it is.",
        "But if you preserve it just the way it is, it's sure as heck going to die.",
        "You can't stop time.",
        "Because if we stop it just the way it is and we want it back just like this.",
        "Do no changes.",
        "Then, what do we got?",
        "Nothing.",
        "You stalemate it.",
        "So we've got to look toward the future a bit.",
        "We can't just do the present.",
        "And we can't use the past too much because we done passed that stage.",
        "Mr.",
        "Campbell, your communities are ones where, you know, we talked about the property tax issue.",
        "Representative Clyburn brought up the sweetgrass issue, you know, the traditional crafts being endangered.",
        "And what Cornelia Bailey was saying was we can't just turn to the past.",
        "So what is the future of the Gullah and Geechee communities?",
        "Well, the future has to include some of the present and the future, but it also has to include, or it could include, some of the past traditions.",
        "No culture is static.",
        "We move with time.",
        "But all cultures have valuable assets that can move with time, such as the sweetgrass basket.",
        "It has changed its use from utilitarian items in the house to now commemorative art.",
        "Food ways that we once used and passed traditional food is now making its way into mainstream America, just like the language."

        "What would you like to see this bill do in terms of preserving this culture?",

        "That's exactly what this is all about.",
