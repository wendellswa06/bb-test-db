        "Mara, as a freelance television reporter, can you talk a little bit about what these dangers say about being in the news media?",
        "Well, just to touch upon what Marcus was talking about in terms of the condition that journalists work in in Russia.",
        "I was there in the fall after Anna Politkovskaya was murdered.",
        "She was an investigative reporter.",
        "And I was covering that story, and it - there was - I was very grateful at that time to be an American journalist because I came face-to-face with the reality that a lot of people risk their lives for this work, and it's very dangerous work for them in different parts of the world.",
        "So it makes me shudder to think that perhaps he was murdered because of the work that he was doing.",
        "Because, you know, as a working journalist, that's a very scary thought.",
        "And my heart definitely goes out to his colleagues and his family because, by all accounts, he was a valued member of the community, a father.",
        "And it's a great loss for the community.",
        "John, what effects do you think this could have on the Oakland Post, on the paper itself and its staff?",
        "Well, first let me express condolences to Chauncey's family on behalf of the National Association of Black Journalists.",
        "Chauncey, as you may know, was one of the founders of the Bay Area Black Journalists Association.",
        "And we will be talking some more about this when we get together for our annual convention next week.",
        "I also wanted to add to what Marcus was saying.",
        "We know what happened in Russia, but I think as a member of the Inter American Press Association's Impunity Committee, we have seen this happen increasingly in our own hemisphere.",
        "There's a lot of it taking place in Mexico and other parts of the central and other parts of Latin America.",
        "And it's something that we have been working to resolve in terms of what impact this would ultimately have on the paper from what I have read.",
        "My sense is that the publishers have every intention to go ahead with the investigation that they were doing.",
        "And I was wondering, John, if you could also talk a little bit about Chauncey's contribution to the field of journalism.",
        "Well, one of the things that I thought was really profound -certainly, the world has lost an exceptional journalist.",
        "And I say the world largely because of his contributions, not just in this country, but what he has done outside.",
        "He's done a lot of pieces from Vietnam and elsewhere.",
        "I think that, as I mentioned, we'll be talking some more about this when NABJ holds its convention next week.",
        "But I think any kind of - this is - if you want to call it an assassination, like this, I think, does not bode well for our profession.",
        "And as Marcus alluded to the fact that it happened here in this country, certainly it gives all of us pause.",
        "I want to move on to some international news.",
        "Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas yesterday.",
        "The meeting was a show of support for Abbas and his ouster of the elected Hamas-led government.",
        "Now Rice is also stumping for a conference that they want to have this fall, which the U.S.",
        "is hoping will lead to some sort of peace discussions between Israel and the Palestinians."

        "Many people with whom I spoke in the region said that they wanted to make certain that this conference, this meeting, was one that would be substantive, that would be meaningful, that would really advance the two-state solution.",
        "Meanwhile, Hamas is accusing Rice of trying to deepen the divisions among Palestinians.",
        "Marcus, do they have a point there?",
        "One person joining the fight against childhood obesity is our guest, Merilee Kern, CEO and founder of the online company Healthy Kids Catalogue.",
        "She's also the author of It's Not Your Fault That You're Overweight.",
        "Merilee joins us from member station KPBS Radio in San Diego, California.",
        "Hi, Merilee.",
        "Well, that's an interesting question.",
        "There might be a point there.",
        "But the point is, I think, the strategic one, which is the administration, of course, led by Secretary Rice is trying to separate Hamas from what the administration and Western Europe, at this point, considers as the legitimate Palestinian government headed by Mahmoud Abbas, and currently occupying the West Bank.",
        "While Hamas, which is considered by many of the Western governments and certainly the United States government as a terrorist organization, occupies the Gaza Strip.",
        "So Hamas, by taking over Gaza by force, they were actually elected democratically to lead the Palestinian legislature.",
        "But Hamas actually took over by force to force out their partners and the Fatah movement, which is the successor to Yasser Arafat's power in the Palestinian Authority.",
        "And they did that themselves.",
        "And so the U.S., you know, that, I think, did more to separate the Palestinian people and to divide them, this civil war that was actually in effect already in the Palestinian territories than anything the U.S.",
        "could do.",
        "I think this is a really interesting challenge that Rice faces.",
        "And she was asked yesterday on her way back to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington what she could accomplish in the next 17 months, because that's all this administration has left.",
        "And given the fact that we've seen this problem for 30 years in the Middle East, this partition of Palestine and the fact that this president was the first one to say, to his credit, most international journalists will tell you that the Palestinians should have their own state.",
        "It should be separate from Israel, and there should be two states in that region next to each other, side-by-side, living in security and peace.",
        "In the Middle East, time is running out.",
        "The clock is ticking.",
        "Rice will, I think, spend the rest of her 17 months in Washington as secretary of state, working to help to ensure that, if there's not a settled Palestinian state by the end of that - George W.",
        "Bush's term, at least there is progress toward it.",
        "It is a huge challenge.",
        "It is hard to believe that this point in the administration will be successful, and lots of the challenges they face actually are of their making.",
        "Rice said, once again, the narrative that she's been saying more and more, what she wants to be the narrative at the end of this administration, which is this administration will leave the Middle East, at least, has seeds for peace, Democratic seeds, she calls them from whether or not (unintelligible).",

        "Sure.",
        "In thinking of the upcoming discussion and attempts to get to the issue of peace, is there any sense of - are these talks this week forecasting anything for the fall?",
        "Well, I think they are.",
        "But, also, let me talk a little bit of - I guess I'm a little bit more optimistic than probably some are, because I see something slightly significant happening here.",
        "When I look at what's happening in the region - particularly as it relates to Hamas and Fatah, and the fact that Rice and other members of the Quartet are pouring billions of dollars into the West Bank - I'm thinking about, to some extent, what happened in Europe between eastern Germany and western Germany.",
        "And my sense is that over a period of time, certainly I don't see it happening within the next 17 months, but I think that they will put in these seeds for some kind of long-term - I don't want to say a Palestinian state happening - but certainly what I see is the U.S.",
        "and other members of the Quartet putting a great deal of money into the West Bank.",
        "And, ultimately, what will happen is that Palestinians in Gaza will be looking at what's happening in the West Bank, and looking at the economic progress that's happening in the West Bank.",
        "And what the U.S.",
        "- and I suspect all the members of the Quartet - will hope coming out of that that they will push for change within Gaza.",

        "Mara, I want to talk to you quickly about Barack Obama and his comments this week saying that he reserves the right for the U.S.",
        "to consider going into Pakistan to deal with terrorists, if need be, and he's taken a lot of heat from rivals about being naive on foreign policy.",
        "Is this conversation or his comments going to improve against those comments?",
        "My guess is no. I think at this point, the Clinton camp must be kind of patting themselves in the back for how masterfully they've played this because his weak point was his foreign policy experience.",
        "And so by calling him naive, they played on that.",
        "And, now, he's puffing out his chest and trying to prove how tough he is.",
        "That he's not weak on terrorism.",
        "That he's not against the use of the military in certain circumstances.",
        "And this is a war-weary nation so, at this point, I think talking about a new military operation in a different country is not something that's really going to score him a lot of points.",

        "That's correct.",
        "The - a heart attack is, in essence, a cessation of blood flow to an area of heart muscle.",
        "What happens when that blood flow is abruptly stopped for a period of 20 minutes or greater, the heart muscle cells die, and the healing process is one of scar formation.",
        "So similar to the scar you get in your skin when you cut it, a scar like that forms in the heart, and it's intended to repair the damage.",
        "But of course scar tissue isn't like muscle, and so the scar can't contract, and permanent damage is caused to the heart muscle.",
        "And then heart failure might kick in.",
        "Right, so when you have a scar that's big enough, the term that we use in medicine, which is a term most people are familiar with, is remodeling.",
        "So the scar tissue causes the heart to blow up by - like a balloon."

        "Another analogy that people will recognize is that the normal heart is shaped like a football, and the failing heart, after a heart attack has occurred in the heart, becomes shaped like a soccer ball or a basketball.",

        "It doesn't work as well.",

        "And so that heart attack leads to a whole host of other very, very serious medical problems.",
        "And once you get this misshapen heart, there's really not much that we can normally do for it, is there?",
        "Correct.",
        "The - so the approach to heart attack currently is to try and restore the blood flow as quickly as possible.",
        "And there's an expression: time is a heart muscle.",
        "So that's why when you - when folks are having heart attacks, we rush them into the cardiac catheterization laboratory to open that blood vessel as quickly as possible.",
        "The sooner we restore the blood, the less damage there is, but the damage that has already occurred is permanent.",
        "And then the other types of treatments we use are lots of medicines to try to make the heart pump easier, and then for those individuals in whom the damage has been so severe, we have to think about heart transplantation or mechanical pumps.",
        "So it's a very, very serious set of consequences that can occur after a heart attack.",

        "Right, so this is - there's a huge amount of enthusiasm in the medical community because of this.",
