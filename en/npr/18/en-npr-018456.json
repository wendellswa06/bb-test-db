        "You know some of the kindest, most gentle, loving parents in the world are rewarding their children, for example, with desert if they eat a good dinner.",
        "And however well intentioned that is, it really defeats the purpose, in terms of their child's health, at least.",
        "So this book also speaks to parents and offers them ways to help empower their child, to help educate the child, and really to open the lines of communication between parents and children; especially those who are afflicted with a weight problem.",
        "And the child is understandably defensive and sensitive on the topic.",
        "This offers a way to talk about the protagonist, either Matt or Patty, rather than the child.",

        "And obviously, it being gender-specific I felt was a stronger means toward that end.",

        "Then, recently, a Gallup poll released last month reported that more Americans described themselves as pro-life than pro-choice.",
        "Between the murder of Dr. George Tiller in Kansas and the likely focus on abortion, the next months' hearings for Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor, we've asked NPR health policy correspond Julie Rovner to bring us up-to-date on these policy questions.",

        "They said, let's take some more public comment.",
        "Now, the issue with these regulations is that they affect far more than abortion and contraception.",
        "They would, indeed, affect abortion and contraception, but the way they are written is so broad that basically any healthcare professional - and I believe it would not impact the caller from earlier who was worried about filling out paperwork.",

        "Now, I should point out that the people who are opposed to these regulations note that they are based on 30 years of law.",

        "The protections are written into law.",

        "Yeah.",
        "You know, I've been covering abortion for 23 years now.",
        "And one of the things that's true about abortion is that it tends to be countercyclical to who's in charge.",

        "And when there is, you know, a pro-life president, a pro-life Congress, then people who are for abortion rights tend to get riled up.",
        "So it wouldn't be surprising that you would see sort of more of a pro-life push in opinion polls.",
        "And if you look at sort of the history of the Gallup poll on this, you would see that.",
        "But what's most interesting about this is a poll - part of the same Gallup poll where they looked at people rather than say, are you pro-choice or pro-life, which can mean an awful lot of things.",
        "If you look at the poll - really, if you print this out, it's on the next page, where they say, do you think abortion should be legal under any circumstances, legal only under certain circumstances, or legal in all circumstances?",
        "So this is the real question: Do you think it should be always legal, always illegal, or legal sometimes?",
        "The number of people - the percentage of people who think it should be always legal or always illegal has barely changed since 1975.",
        "In 1975, the people who thought it should be always illegal was 21 percent, and now it's 22 percent.",
        "The people who thought it should be always legal was 22 percent, now it's 23 percent.",
        "So I mean, that's basically unchanged over, you know - what is this -35 years.",
        "And the number of people who think it should be legal sometimes, which I like to call the muddled middle, has gone from 54 percent in 1975 to 53 percent now.",
        "So essentially, what you have is over these - you know, however many years it's been, essentially, no change in opinion on abortion.",
        "And I think that has really been just what you see these changes, these little waves of public opinion as you see policy shift over the years.",
        "But essentially, most people believe that abortion should be illegal in some circumstances and legal in other circumstances.",
        "And the biggest fight is over when.",
        "And that has to do with timing and so-called late abortions and all of that, which we heard on discussions earlier."
