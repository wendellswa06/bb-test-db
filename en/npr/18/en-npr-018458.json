        "And we can talk more about that, but there are other issues, as well.",
        "Will the developing countries agree to make binding commitments of some sort, particularly the large-emitting developing countries?",
        "Well, they've shown that they're willing to do lots of things nationally, but they haven't really gone that extra step yet.",
        "And part of the reason they haven't gone is because we don't have a number, and part of the reason is because they are expecting some financing to help them reach their objectives, and no one has been able to figure out what the mechanism should be or how much money is really going to be required or given.",
        "What a mess.",
        "Yes, what a mess.",
        "Wow, trying to get that all done by the meeting.",

        "Will the other committees who are involved in this in the Senate be able to act in time?",
        "Would there be a vote?",
        "I think the chance of that before Copenhagen are really zero."

        "And this week, South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said in an op-ed piece in the New York Times that he would support climate-change legislation.",
        "Yes, which is terrific because the way I do the math, you've got about 40 Democrats who I think would likely support a reasonable bill.",
