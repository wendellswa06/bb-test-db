        "I mean, we didn't do anything until the economy started looking like the Titanic in the Atlantic.",

        "Right.",
        "I mean, jobs are jobs.",
        "If you're manufacturing wind turbines or doing carbon capture and sequestration or even another nuclear plant, those are jobs, and that's manufacturing.",

        "You know, a coal plant every, you know, six months or every year, I don't know how the facts work out - but I was wondering if anybody in the panel could address that."

        "And maybe why these guys can't get any business.",
        "Well - I mean, actually, for - we import a lot of these things from China, because we don't actually have the manufacturing here, and you could ask why we don't have that much of the manufacturing here, and I think it's because we don't have a policy that says these are the things you have to do, either by requiring that certain percentage to be from renewables, for example, or by putting a price on carbon, which would make, you know, low-carbon or carbon-free sources of energy more profitable.",

        "Yeah, but I think that's because we don't have a policy in place that says you have to do this, or that puts a price on carbon so it becomes attractive to do this."
