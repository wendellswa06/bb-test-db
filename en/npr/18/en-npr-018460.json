        "Right.",
        "In fact, we're not that efficient.",
        "And if there's a price on carbon, that becomes the thing that happens first.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And I think that's why, you know, we're sitting here lamenting what's not happening and that's I think why Lester Brown was on last time saying, it ain't going to happen till something happens, you know?",
        "Something big happens to show that we better get moving on.",

        "Well…",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "…or that isn't what actually does it.",
        "Because I mean I think it's so much in our interests, you know, the global interest, to take this on.",
        "What do you think then is the best scenario, giving your summation of Copenhagen, that we can expect to come out of that meeting?",
        "Well, I mean, if we could come out with a framework, something that sort of puts everything in place minus the very specific numbers, like exactly how much money, exactly what is committed to, you know, and what the target is.",
        "I think that would be tremendous progress, and I think that's a challenge.",
        "I also think it's important that we have some kind of a date certain to finish this, so that it doesn't look like it's just going into Never-Neverland.",
        "If we can do that, and then if the Senate acts in the first, you know, third of next year, because, you know, you're in an election year, so it's going to happen early, we actually might be able to wind something up, let's say, by the middle of the year next year, which - I mean, this is the positive scenario.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, critics of the Kyoto Treaty, you know, say, lot of promises were made, but even the people who signed on couldn't keep those promises.",
        "Well, I don't think it's fair to say that.",
        "The period of the Kyoto Treaty that is important was 2008 to 2012.",
        "And actually, we're only in 2009.",
        "So it's a little premature, I think, to say those countries that ratified it and have specific targets didn't meet it.",
        "I actually believe that, for example, the Europeans as a whole will meet it."

        "But you know, we're not at 2012 yet.",
        "And so those who say it's been a failure, I think, are just trying to show that we shouldn't do this.",
        "Is Copenhagen supposed to be the next step after Kyoto?",
        "Yes, it's supposed to sort of deal with the period after, I think probably in a new treaty that supersedes Kyoto.",
        "Although the developing countries would like to keep Kyoto and just have sort of an add-on piece that would deal with them.",
        "And there are all kinds of legal reasons that they would prefer that and others might not.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So we have to watch to see what happens in Congress with the energy legislation there, and then see if we can get out of this entanglement of Copenhagen.",
        "Yes, because I mean there also is sort of a movement to, if I can sort of put it bluntly, blame the U.S.",
        "for a failure in Copenhagen.",
        "And while you could say we are certainly part of the problem, I think it's pretty clear that we're not all of it.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Well, at least we have more vocal support from this president than we had from the other one.",
        "And because a lot has really happened.",

        "He's going to talk about Darwin's legacy.",

        "Scientists were - this is interesting.",
        "They were investigating a coal mine in Colombia, South America, when they unearthed the fossilized remains of ancient snakes.",
        "And when they examined the fossil remains - and there were a lot of them - 28 piles of snake bones found - and they put the pieces together, they realized that they stumbled on a discovery worthy of Indiana Jones.",
        "There were snakes there that were as long as 40 feet, weighing 2,500 pounds - that's right: thousands of pounds of snake.",
        "And snakes just don't get that big any more.",
        "I know you're probably thinking, that's a good thing.",
        "And it is, in more ways than one because scientists who study snakes say, the animals can only get that big - I mean, yellow school bus size - if there really is a really warm climate.",
        "And so, that tells scientists something about evolution and the state of the planet in that period.",
        "Joining me more to talk about it is Jason Head, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Toronto in Mississauga, Ontario - excuse me - and he joins us by phone.",

        "What kind of family would it be in?",
        "Well, based on the anatomy of the vertebrae - of the backbones - my research group and I have figured out that this snake was most closely related to modern boa constrictors, and it was in the snake clade Boidae, which include the boas, the sand boas, the tree boas, rainbow boas and anacondas.",
