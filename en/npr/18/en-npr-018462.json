        "And what they found the snake with were the remains of giant two-meter long aquatic turtles, some large-bodied fish and a variety of primitive crocodilians.",
        "And based on ecological similarities that we infer with modern anacondas and the diversity in number of crocodilians, we think it was probably eating these primitive crocodilian.",

        "No.",
        "The last extinction of the non-bird dinosaurs occurred about 66 and a half million years ago, and the snake is from rocks dated between 58 and 60 million years.",

        "Well, the snakes - the specimens were actually found by several of my colleagues - Jonathan Bloch and his students from the University of Florida and Carlos Jaramillo from Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.",

        "Well, primarily, - well, there's probably a couple reasons for that, but the main reason is probably climate.",
        "One of the things that we did with this snake is - once it was realized that we were looking at what was clearly the world's largest snake and once we'd backed out how big this animal really was, the one thing that struck us is that there must be a climate story in there somewhere.",
        "Just to have a cold-blooded animal that big in the equatorial regions of the neotropics at that age must tell us something about climate.",
        "So, what we were able to do is we were actually able to take the known relationship between body size, metabolic rate and ambient temperature in living cold-blooded vertebrates or animals today and actually derive that equation to figure out past temperatures, based on the fossil snake.",
        "And what kind of temperatures were you looking at?",
        "Well, we got mean annual temperatures for the equatorial regions in the Paleocene of about 31 to 32 degrees C, and that's about six to seven degrees warmer than the neotropics in the same latitudes today.",
        "So, you're talking in the 90s Fahrenheit.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And that's the mean annual temperature, that's the average temperature.",
        "And so, for those snakes to survive, they had to - we had to have that kind of heat for them?",
        "Exactly.",
        "So, with cold-blooded animals like snakes, there's a critical minimum temperature under which an animal of a certain size can't survive.",
        "So, the critical minimum temperature that it would need to sustain efficient metabolism in a 42 to 49 foot-long snake would be basically 31 to 32 degrees C.",
        "So, as the earth - so, as the climate temperature there cooled off, that probably killed the snakes out?",
        "Well, I don't think we have a sense really yet for the history of this group.",
        "We only have them from this one thin horizon of rock, and we don't know how long they persisted in the fossil record, we don't when they first evolved these large sizes, and we don't know when they went extinct or basically began to reduce their body size evolutionarily.",
        "And why such a collection in one spot of dead snakes?"

        "Well, it's - the mine represents, again, this depositional environment.",
        "It represents a large-scale river system where you have basically water moving at some current in an environment that would have been full of vertebrate life and plant life.",
        "And basically, you would have animals expiring and being entrained into the soft sediments at the bottom of the river.",

        "Now, the kind of snakes you describe - the anacondas, that family - don't they constrict their prey - they wrap around them?",
        "They do.",
        "And based on the relationships with this snake to other living boaids(ph), the most parsimonious assumption is to infer that in fact, the snake was probably constricting as well.",
        "It would need something big to (Laughing) constrict around for a 40-foot snake, would it not?",
        "Well, it could wrap very easily around something three or four meters, say, one of the largest primitive crocodiles, and be very good at constricting it very quickly.",
        "So, it's not just swallowing it, it's constricting it first?",
        "Right.",
