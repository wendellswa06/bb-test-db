        "And you're at the trial now.",
        "Tell us what it was like.",
        "The Olympic trials here in Eugene have been just phenomenal.",
        "Eugene is really known as the Track City U.S.A., and they've had 20,000-plus people every single day inside the stadium, and probably another five or 10,000 hanging out in the festival around the stadium.",
        "The competition itself was, I think, everything that everybody thought it would be.",
        "We had two great performances with Christian and Reese Hoffa going against - well, Reese won with a first-place finish, and I was third, and Christian was second.",
        "But it was a great performance and I think we've got a great team going on to Eugene in the shot-put.",
        "Or going on to Beijing.",
        "Going on to Beijing.",
        "Four years, maybe, the Olympics will be in Eugene.",
        "Maybe another time.",
        "But I have to ask you when - now, you're an old hand at this, by this point, but you know, going into this competition, one bad day and four years of work means you're not going to Beijing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I had a bit of a scare, too, on Saturday.",
        "I was in fourth place going into the finals, and I was thinking about that as we stepped in the ring for the finals there, and I knew I needed to improve.",
        "Fortunately, I was able to improve just enough to make the team, but I'll tell you, it is not all for lost if you don't make the team.",
        "It's a tremendous accomplishment to compete at the Olympic trials and to compete at this level.",
        "Some days, you just don't have it, and my heart goes out to those guys that do finish fourth or fifth and end up being alternates on the team.",
        "They've got to be tremendously disappointed.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "We spend - it's - you know, a lot of people make the mistake and believe that, you know, the Olympics really happens only once every four years, but it really doesn't.",
        "For Olympic athletes and Olympic hopefuls, it's an everyday thing for four years.",
        "We spend, in my event, you know, I spend several hours, three to six hours, every single day for four years training for what really amounts to less than a minute and a half total of competition time.",
        "And if you're not on, on that day, there is no room.",
        "There's no appeals process.",
        "There's no such thing as well, you know, I can get through because of my past performances.",
        "You have to perform on that day.",
        "There's a lot of pressure, a lot of stress, and ultimately that's what the Olympic trials - that's why the Olympic trials are America's hardest team to make.",
        "Tell us what you do on a normal day, I mean, not talking about the Olympic trials, but just a regular Tuesday.",
        "A regular Tuesday.",
        "Well, a regular Tuesday, I'm actually in business school at the University of Virginia, at the Darden School of Business.",
        "So, a regular Tuesday would probably involve some class time and some study time.",
        "And after class, typically, I go out and train.",
        "I get my first training session in outside on the track, and that's about an hour and a half to two hours of anything from conditioning to throwing workouts and stretching routines afterwards.",
        "And then I'll go back and hit the books for a little bit, spend some time with my wife.",
        "And after that, I'll go back and finish my second workout of the day, which is about another hour and a half or two, and that tends to be weight work and another stretching routine.",
        "And do you ever say to yourself, jeez, \"\"NCIS\"\" is on tonight"

        "Not quite.",

        "I don't get that opportunity a lot once the competitive season starts up, and certainly, once I start traveling and really preparing in the final moments for the Olympic Games.",
        "Those are the times when I have to be very selfish, and fortunately, my family and my friends and everybody that I work with knows that I'm not really trying to ignore them, or not trying to ignore them, really trying to focus on what I need to do to prepare for my competition at the Olympics.",

        "Well, eight years ago was my first Olympic Games.",
        "I was extraordinarily excited just to be there and I really wasn't even focused on the competition.",
        "I think I sort of bought into sort of the whole Olympic movement and how special it really is and how much of an accomplishment it is just to even be there.",
        "Winning my first silver medal was a great accomplishment for me, and I was very excited about that, but then in the second Olympics, I wanted to improve upon it.",
        "And I kind of had an interesting second Olympics in 2004.",
        "I really did actually struggle with some of the motivation problems, motivation throughout that year, which is kind of interesting for me, because I've never had that problem before.",
        "But I got into the Olympics and I was in a great position.",
        "I was healthy and ready to throw far, and I ended up tying and losing in a tiebreaker to the ultimate winner.",
        "So, this Olympics, for me, it's about attaining a great performance on the day that matters the most, and I have yet to really do that in the past two Olympics.",
        "And so, I'm really getting myself physically and mentally to have a peak right at the Olympics on that specific day, August 15th, in Beijing, and if I can do that, if I can have a great performance in Beijing, it doesn't matter what the outcome is.",
        "I'll be very satisfied.",
        "So even in you finish second again, or don't get a medal at all, if you do what you think is your best, that's good.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "You know, I had - in 2000, I had the opportunity to actually talk with Tommy Lasorda, the great baseball manager for the Dodgers for so many years",
        "He was the manager of the U.S.",
        "team in Sydney that year.",
        "He was, and that's how I got to know him, and he pulled me aside one day on the way out of the Olympic cafeteria and he said, how do you think you're going to play?",
        "He said, when do you play?",
        "I said, well, I play on Friday.",
        "He said, how do you think you're going to do?",

        "Winners go out there and do, do, do.",
        "And so, it's taken maybe a little bit of time for that to set in, but the point was made right there in the Olympic Village in 2000, and I think I really started to embrace what he was saying and his theories on performance and athletes over the last few years.",
        "And that's, we don't go out there and try our best.",
        "We go out there and do our best.",
        "And there's a very subtle but very important difference between the two.",
