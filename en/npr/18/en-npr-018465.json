        "Basically, the whole day is structured around practice and recovery to make sure that I'm ready for each practice, each day.",

        "And here we were, thinking, wow, you know, we're not at the Olympics yet, but we're being included, and then the tragedy that followed just - it was just kind of a different - there was the joy, and then there was the reality of that happening at the same time",
        "Of course, that was the Olympics where Israeli athletes were first kidnapped and later murdered."

        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "But the interesting thing was the next year, our sport was put into the World Aquatic Championships, and it's been included ever since.",
        "And then several of my teammates and I went - we had to have 15 countries, I believe, the minimum in order to have it be an Olympic sport.",
        "So I went to Germany and South Africa and coached.",
        "I had friends who went to Japan and Canada and Switzerland.",
        "And so we all had to kind of fan out in the '70s in order to bring the sport up to a level where it would be considered a verifiable sport at the Olympic level.",

        "It doesn't get a lot of respect",

        "Well, but - you know, strangely enough now, the finals are one of the most highly attended of any Olympic finals, so it's kind of - it was nice.",
        "It was an adventurous youth to have.",
        "An adventurous youth.",
        "Yes.",
        "And a lot of traveling, and you do get to see a lot of the world.",
        "Yes, it definitely is.",
        "The way we select our team now is we have four days of qualification over two competitions, our U.S.",
        "Nationals, and then we have our Olympic trials, which we just had in Philadelphia a couple of weeks ago.",
        "And after that, we total up all the scores and there's a committee of five guys that look over all the scores and take in a bunch of different things into account.",
        "And then they select the team according to how they think, you know, the top six guys would fit into that.",
        "It's like a big puzzle.",
        "Even if you finish in the top, it doesn't necessarily guarantee a spot onto the team.",
        "And that's - since it's inevitably not objective, it's got to be something of a disappointment when you figure there can't be all that much difference between you and the next guy.",
        "Yeah, but you know, we go into it knowing that that's the way that our sport is.",
        "We understand that those guys have a very difficult task in selecting the team.",
        "I don't envy their position.",
        "It's very, very difficult.",
        "And you know, we do everything we can to be selected, and in the end, we leave it up to them.",

        "First of all, do you think you've had to make sacrifices, and do you think this is in any way an obsession?",

        "Probably the biggest sacrifice I've had to make with gymnastics is being away from my family for so long.",

        "But along with that is that they've been able to share in all of the great parts of what I've been able to do with gymnastics.",
        "So, I mean, in any great thing that you go after in your life, sacrifices are needed.",
        "And in terms of it being an obsession, there's probably an aspect to it where you have to be obsessed to get to the top level.",
        "I'm not going to deny that.",
        "I'm definitely a perfectionist in that sense.",
        "But I really think that it's worth it in the end.",
        "And you know, if you're willing to go after that, you have to make certain things a priority.",
