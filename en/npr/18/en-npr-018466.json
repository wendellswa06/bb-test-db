        "And is the reward for that, do you think - obviously, you're giving up some other things in life.",
        "Presumably, by this point, you could be well-launched in a career.",
        "Yeah, but you know, it's - I started doing this kind of late for an athlete.",
        "I started at 15.",
        "I did gymnastics growing up.",

        "And do you get paid to be a fulltime professional gymnast?",
        "Yes, a very small amount of money, but living at the training center, we have no expenses, so anything that I make from my sponsor I'm able to save",
        "All right.",
        "And Laura Wilkinson, do you get paid by Speedo?",
        "Yes.",
        "I get a salary by Speedo.",

        "Yeah, and I mean, still for diving, since it's a smaller sport, so they aren't very many of us that are sponsored, but it's becoming a little easier, and you know, a lot of the people in my sport as well are also at their peak in their teenage years, so a lot of them don't get the support where they need to, making an income after college to keep diving.",

        "The big difference for me was I had come from a very successful corporate career where I had been an officer of a technology company in charge of logistics, so I had a pretty good background in terms of business and a lot of competing at sports at this level, particularly in a capital-intensive sport like bobsled, is kind of about running your own business.",

        "And your ability to market yourself and your sport to potential companies is critical, particularly in sports that are very capital-intensive and that have very specialized equipment, building a website, communicating with your people who are supporting you and whether that be financially or emotionally or physically.",
        "But competing at that level is very much like running your own business, particularly if you have to put your own teams together like we did in women's bobsled.",
        "You have to go out there and get athletes, you have to procure highly specialized equipment and then you've got to pay for all your travel, if you're not in the one or two spots on the national team to compete and become competitive at the Olympic level.",
        "Let me ask Laura Wilkinson.",
        "Obviously, you're in an individual sport, not a team sport, and you don't jump off the platform in a bobsled",

        "There aren't platforms anywhere near where we are and we have a team that's won the last three nationals in a row, and I'm trying to create - or build a new facility for my team.",
        "So, I do understand what she's saying, and it's hard sometimes, especially when you are in sports that aren't on the TV all the time, except maybe on Olympic time.",
        "You know, we try to capitalize on that, you know, momentum and that excitement around the Games.",
        "But you definitely do have to kind of step out and use those business-type skills.",

        "I mean, I have a college degree, but it wasn't in business, but it definitely comes in handy.",
