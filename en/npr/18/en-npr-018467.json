        "He would even be able to choose which kids.",
        "And then we would still do our book swap.",
        "So all the other kids would bring books.",

        "So did that surprise you?",
        "I was not particularly surprised because I think that whenever you decide to make a different choice for your kids that is sort of out of line with mainstream values, you have some explaining to do.",

        "You know, I didn't really think that what we were doing was particularly noteworthy or such a big deal, but there was this very intense sense that we were deviating.",
        "And I think that whether, you know, you're deciding that your kid has to go to church rather than soccer practice or whatever choice you're imposing, if it's not the same choice that most other people are making, they are likely to take issue with it.",

        "And he testified against them at trial, which was very controversial within the Somali-American community of Minneapolis.",
        "And then when it came to sentencing time, the federal judge in the case, Judge Michael Davis, just looked at Abdullahi Yusuf and said, I just don't see how prison will help this boy.",
        "He felt that Yusuf had changed.",
        "So what he did is he gave him time served in jail plus a year in a halfway house and 20 years supervised release.",
        "And I think that's the first time that's happened with an admitted terrorist defendant in our country.",
        "And Abdullahi Yusuf has just finished his time in the halfway house.",

        "And again, this is not a widespread program.",
        "This is very much an experimental program.",
        "But you also have to understand that to have terrorism charges in some cases in this - in the United States, to be guilty of material support to a terrorist organization, all you have to do is decide that you want to go to Syria, buy a plane ticket and have the intention of possibly joining a group like ISIS.",
        "You may ask.",
        "I'm not going to answer.",
        "And there's a lot of naivete that's wrapped around this because - particularly at the time that Abdullahi went, he didn't really know what ISIS was about.",
        "He said that to me over and over again in interviews, that he thought that they were there fighting Assad.",
        "Everyone agreed that Assad was a bad guy, so he was going to fight with this group that does that.",
        "Now, since that time, we've clearly had a real change in ISIS.",
        "They declared a caliphate.",
        "They beheaded journalists.",
        "They killed untold numbers of Muslims.",
        "So I would be surprised if this kind of program would necessarily be used for people who now believe that ISIS is a group that they want to join.",
        "But in those early days, before everyone understood what ISIS was, maybe a rehab program - at least in Abdullahi Yusuf's case - was the right remedy.",
