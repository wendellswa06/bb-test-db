        "As you look at the situation - human rights groups, as you know, have come to the conclusion that there seems to be a concerted campaign to assassinate or drive away the elite class, if you will.",
        "Is that something that you believe to be true, or is that something that, well, it just seems so bad that you could come to that conclusion?",
        "Well, there certainly are interest groups in Iraq who would like to see the more sectarian, the more secular, the more Western-looking leave the country.",
        "And that's part of the equation.",
        "The other part is just that it's about power, and the universities and the campuses represent centers of power that various groups want to control.",
        "So whether or not there's a plan in place, the fact remains that Iraq's academics - its professors, its lawyers, its professional class - because of who they are, and because of their training, and because of the past, have all felt really the brunt of targeted assassinations and so on.",
        "Many of them, though, are being killed for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, which is - you know, as we say this last month, almost 3,900 people were killed in Iraq - many of those were just random acts of violence.",
        "We're talking about the brain drain, specifically from Iraq and from Afghanistan.",
        "If you've left there, if you know somebody who has, give us a call: 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK.",

        "after bringing injured children to the United States - just left, went back to Baghdad.",
        "She had a home in the green zone.",
        "Her home was no longer available to her through other circumstances, and she's now living in the red zone.",
        "I am desperately fearful of her safety, trying to convince her to leave.",
        "She feels very strongly that she must stay because of this brain drain.",
        "And two days ago, her uncle was kidnapped.",
        "Her family are immobilized.",
        "They're living in their homes.",
        "They can't conduct any of their daily activities.",
        "And I have tremendous respect for her for wanting to stay there and sending a message to her colleagues about how important it is to stay there, and yet I wonder at what price, at was cost, she's doing that.",
        "Keith Watenpaugh, that must be a familiar dilemma.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And unfortunately, one of the real dilemmas is those Iraqi intellectuals, academic doctors and so on that were seen to be too close to the Americans, were often the ones first targeted.",
        "And that was a very difficult fact for the early American occupational forces to try and deal with.",
        "And now we're seeing, you know, other things happening.",
        "People who know English well enough to translate and so on are working to try to create some kind of collaborative action between the West and Iraq are the ones most easily targeted.",
        "So my heart goes out to the physician, and I would hope that more people could do that, but I think that for many of these individuals who leave, they're thinking about themselves second but their families first.",
        "And many times they're getting themselves and their families out.",
        "And this is something that's been going on in the Arab Middle East, really since the 1890s, where the considerations of the society and so on take second place to the considerations of the family.",
        "And getting out for your family and protecting your family, is very important.",
        "And so I've never - I've never ever wanted to point fingers at people and saying, why didn't you stay, why didn't you stay?",
        "Because the decision to leave is one that is so hard and so heart-wrenching, that when people leave it's the most difficult thing they've ever done in their lives."

        "And they are either harassed, threatened or killed, and most of them decided to leave the country because of the situation.",
        "And now, the campuses in Iraq are overruled and controlled by the militia, religious militia, namely the Madhi Army and the Supreme Council of Islamic Republic.",
        "They are after the academics, the faculty - in order to impose their own values.",
        "And I've learned that some classes have been cancelled and they rock the (unintelligible) and they are trying to separate the girls from the boys.",
        "And the warlords in Iraq actually they are eyeing the universities because the professors are holding different views; they are more open to the West.",
        "And their agenda - I mean the warlords - is to model the Iraq now, you know, they are working hard to model Iraq one of the Iranian example.",
        "And that's why they are forcing the women faculty, the girls in the school, to wear scarf, longer scarf on the Iranian model.",

        "It's very sad story to see Iraqi campuses overruled by a forest of turbans."
