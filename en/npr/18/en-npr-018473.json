        "But you see, I'm praying for peace to prove - my student need me and I need my university.",

        "Thank you for having me.",
        "That's an Iraqi scholar who was forced to leave the country due to the worsening violence and threats, and we appreciate his taking the time to speak with us.",
        "We've decided not to identify him for obvious reasons.",
        "And as mentioned, Iraq is hardly the only country being drained of its intellectual resources.",

        "I was going to say that this is the story that we're hearing about Iraq - Afghanistan has been facing that story for the past 26 years.",
        "The first wave of the brain drain that's occurred in Afghanistan was in late 1970s and early 1980s that - that was the wave of the Afghan professionals that left.",
        "And then the second wave was with the civil war and the fall of Kabul, the socialist government - that people that had socialist leanings but still educated core of the elite of Afghanistan - that left the country with the onset of the invasion of Taliban.",
        "And, of course, post-Taliban in recent days, things have not been exactly great."

        "Yeah.",

        "But unfortunately…",
        "Did you think about going back?",
        "I did think about the idea at one point, but I've been here for so long, and put in roots and I have my own family and the kids, which makes it very difficult for us uproot everything that you've built and go back.",
        "But, I mean, people like me certainly can contribute and they have contributed to the rebuilding that that's going on right now.",
        "As you look at - I know you've been back to Afghanistan, but the situation now, that brain gain that did occur after the fall of the Taliban, that seems to have been reversed.",
        "Yes.",
        "As you mentioned, I went back about this time of the year last year, and one of the things that was disheartening was to see again long lines in front of passport office, as well as the long line standing trying to get visas to other countries.",
        "And most of them - I mean, people between the age of maybe 19 to mid-40s - the people that actually are needed to rebuild the country - people with skills.",
        "I mean, we've talked a lot about the professionals, but the people that are actually needed are really the bricklayers, the carpenters, the people that start small businesses, the entrepreneurs.",
        "Those are the people that actually - both of these countries need, especially Afghanistan.",
        "And when the onset of the up-tick in violence and the new phenomenon in Afghanistan with respect to suicide bombings that has occurred and that civilians being targeted - that has created an environment that people are rethinking.",

        "The first few years there was the euphoria that, well, there was this huge change in the country.",
        "And then as the elections were completed and as people, the donor countries, agreed to provide funds to the rebuilding of the country - and a lot of people that participated in these activities didn't see much change in their livelihood, their normal lives.",
        "There's still no electricity in Kabul.",
        "It's only a few hours a week.",
        "No clean water, no basic public good type of services that people could sort of count on.",

        "And even going from one side of the city to the other side of the city requires hours.",
        "I mean it's very difficult for the university students and professors to get from their homes in one side of the city - to get to Kabul University.",
        "And so these - and the environment and the lack of security has created an extreme challenge for people.",
        "Let's see if we can get a caller on the line.",
