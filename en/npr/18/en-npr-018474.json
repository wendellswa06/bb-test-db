        "I'm Neal Conan.",
        "This is the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Normally, we click open the inbox and read from your e-mails on Tuesdays, but we ran a little short on time yesterday, so this week Wednesday will be the day we read from your e-mails.",
        "And we begin with a clarification.",
        "We talked yesterday about the new comic-book version of the 9/11 Report.",
        "The full title is the 9/11 Report: A Graphic Adaptation.",
        "It's by Sid Jacobson and Ernie Colon.",
        "At the end of the program, I mentioned that the book is available at comic-book stores, which is true, but more importantly it's also available at most regular book stores, too.",
        "And my apologies for the mix-up.",
        "A week ago, we spoke with Cuban exiles here in America about their response to the news of Fidel Castro's health problems, the temporary transfer of power in Havana, and what they planned to do if there was change back home.",
        "Leota Rush(ph) complained that we missed some key points.",
        "Exiles, she wrote, rarely mention that the dictatorship of Batista preceding Castro was a repressive government for the many poor who lived in Cuba.",
        "It was supported by the military, the lawyers, the doctors, the plantation owners, etc. There was a need for change, and that is what motivated Castro, albeit with a leftist political philosophy.",
        "The first exiles were those who fled Cuba after the revolution, who had been supported and profited from the Batista regime.",
        "They were consumed with a return to Cuba that included the reinstatement of their wealth and the status quo.",
        "Since then, the Castro regime has imposed its own brand of suffering on the people of Cuba, but for exiles not to acknowledge that there was a population suffering greatly at the time of the revolution is shameful.",
        "Another listener in Lafayette, Colorado e-mailed about coverage of the controversy surrounding exhibits of human cadavers like the one called Body Worlds.",
        "The exhibits use preserved human bodies, often posed in theatrical positions, for public display.",
        "On the program, questions were raised about ethics and about respect for the dead, among others.",
        "Eric Belsey(ph) wrote: Death has become generally so hidden and sanitized.",
        "I'm glad that we have respect for the dead, but I also think that we as a culture are terrified of this natural, inevitable process and want no reminders of this reality.",
        "This issue comes down to individual responsibility, that is the informed consent of the donors and the personal choice to attend the exhibit.",
        "I'm glad these kinds of exhibits are flourishing, and I'm concerned when one group says that their attitudes towards death and the body are somehow more worthy of respect and mine are less so.",
        "From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.",
        "I'm Michele Norris.",
        "Please warn older adults about HPV virus dangers, also.",
        "That's human papilloma virus.",
        "Joyce writes, my story is identical to hers: a long-time monogamous marriage with a divorce at 60, a five-year intimacy with a good friend who infected me with two severe strains of HPV - those which can lead to cervical cancer - which I am now battling."

        "She had no choice but to go on welfare.",
        "Once we moved back to Cincinnati from Minnesota, my mother was able to get off welfare, find a job as a crossing guard, then as a kitchen worker at a convent, and then finally as a secretary at the university.",

        "The maverick Wisconsin Democrat won a special election in 1957 following the death of Joseph McCarthy, and he served in the United States Senate until 1989.",
        "He was best known for his monthly Golden Fleece Awards which lampooned the most egregious examples of wasteful government spending.",
        "Joining us now to talk about the life and legacy of Senator Proxmire is John Nichols, editor of The Capital Times in Madison, Wisconsin.",
        "He's at the studios of member station WHA in Madison.",
        "Nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "It's a great pleasure to be on with you, Neal.",
        "I understand William Proxmire actually worked at a reporter at The Capital Times once upon a time.",
        "Yes, in about 1950.",
        "He wasn't the best reporter though.",
        "He seemed to be a lot more interested in getting his political opinion into the stories than actually reporting, so he was rather quickly shuffled off to the Wisconsin Legislature where he won a seat while still working as a reporter.",
        "It's difficult to imagine two senators more different than Joe McCarthy and William Proxmire."

        "In a sense you're right, but not entirely.",
        "They were both mavericks and the odd thing was that just as McCarthy at least in the quite councils of the Republican Party embarrassed his own party, Proxmire often embarrassed his own party.",
        "He was very willing to challenge Democratic presidents and Democratic Senate leaders particularly on government spending issues.",
        "We're talking about the late Senator William Proxmire, who died earlier today.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Senator Proxmire was a bear on spending, including spending on his own political campaigns.",
        "Well, that's the best story of all.",
        "Bill Proxmire got elected initially in '57 with a relatively conventional campaign.",
        "He beat a millionaire, but he did get campaign contributions.",
        "But he hated fund-raising.",
        "And so very quickly he stopped accepting campaign contributions and his ran his last two US Senate campaigns in 1976 and 1982 against credible and well-financed Republican challengers by spending under $200 out of his own pocket in each campaign.",
        "He was not averse to the occasional political stunt, however.",
        "Oh, no. I think that Proxmire understood a dynamic of politics that I think is lost on a lot of folks today.",
        "They think the only way to run for office is to spend a lot of money on TV ads.",
        "Proxmire had a two-fold way of running for office.",
        "First off, he shook hands at astronomical rates.",
        "He was once in the Guinness Book of World Records for having shaken the most hands in a single day, something like 30,000 at a state fair.",
        "But the other thing he did was he took on the powers that be, and he was sure to send a press release out when he did it.",
        "The Golden Fleece Award was one of his tricks, if you will.",
        "But the other thing he did is he never missed a roll-call vote and he made a big deal about letting people know that he was on the job, and he also would grab ahold of issues and never let go of them.",
        "He wanted the Senate to ratify a global treaty against genocide, and he started in 1967 giving a speech each day that the Senate was in session urging the ratification.",
        "He kept doing it until 1987; he had given more than 3,100 speeches when the Senate finally did the job.",
        "He was also an opponent of what he described as wasteful government spending, or pork, and I guess that's a lot of what the Golden Fleece Awards were about.",
        "But did he ever meet a milk-price support he didn't like?",
        "Well, of course not.",
        "He's a Wisconsinite and you understand that milk is essential.",
        "But you know, even on ag issues he could occasionally anger a constituent.",
        "But the fact of the matter was that Proxmire was first and foremost a good politician, and he knew who his constituents were, and frankly it was the diary farmers of Wisconsin who switched from their Republican sentiments, having been in many cases big backers of McCarthy, over to supporting this maverick Democrat."
