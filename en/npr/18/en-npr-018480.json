        "Gallagher won bids for seven stimulus projects, putting close to 300 people on his payroll at the peak of the construction season this summer - 150 of them on this job alone.",
        "Most years, he says about half of the company's revenue comes from public projects, half from private, such as building roads for subdivisions or parking lots for new strip malls.",
        "But this year, Gallagher says that kind of private sector work dropped off to almost nothing.",
        "And he says public projects, including those funded by the stimulus now make up more than 98 percent of his company's business.",
        "Without it, we would have been very, very severely impacted.",
        "Even with the stimulus, Gallagher says he has fewer workers this year, many are working fewer hours and this construction season has been shorter than usual.",
        "It was a shot in the arm, but it's not a sustaining shot in the arm.",
        "Gallagher and many other highway contractors are now more worried about next year than they were at the start of 2009, which at the time look bleak at best.",
        "The Illinois Road and Transportation Builders Association says as important as the stimulus was, it did not provide as much money for infrastructure projects as hoped.",
        "The last massive six year federal transportation's spending plan has expired with no replacement in sight.",
        "Highway construction contractors say if there is no reauthorization of that transportation built soon, many of them could be put out of business."
