        "Despite this, many doctors, including Manno, suspected neurologic patients could actually benefit from getting out of bed sooner, they just didn't have any proof.",
        "Although plenty of research had been done on early mobilization of patients with other injuries, Klein discovered that no one had actually studied whether it was safe or beneficial for patients with brain injury to start rehabilitation right away, and so she designed a study of her own.",
        "Over the course of a year, Klein tracked more than 600 patients with brain injury, getting more than half of them up and out of bed as early as the first day they were admitted to the ICU.",
        "What she found was that getting up and moving had clear benefits.",
        "We found that when patients actually get out of bed and progress in their rehabilitation early, they spend less time in the ICU, they spend less time in the hospital, they have less pressure ulcers, less infections, less time on the ventilator if they need ventilator therapy, and they also just feel a lot better.",

        "This is a strange one.",
        "He told us yesterday that he basically had trained through some of his palsy so that he'd - by being very, very fit he'd overcome a lot of the handicaps, but people in seven-on-the- side decided that he was too fit, he was too agile, so he's been ruled out.",

        "Well, this was a time when violence took hold of our society because of the campaign by the IRA of bombing and shooting, and because of a counter-campaign by loyalist paramilitaries, which was in many instances (unintelligible) sectarian - whereby innocent Catholics were chosen as victims as they walked on the street.",
        "So young people were growing up in that on a daily basis, living with the huge security response to trouble.",
        "So it was normal to live here with soldiers on our streets in full battle dress escorting police officers.",
        "You'd find a situation where a police officer might be administering a parking ticket, surrounded by British soldiers to give him cover.",
        "So, for ordinary people, life became dominated by restrictions on their mobility by searches and security, and by occasionally being caught up in explosions or exchanges of gunfire."

        "Kleim says much of the animal research has been focused on finding ways to jumpstart the rewiring process with drugs or electrical shocks.",
        "But in people, there's a much simpler way to drive the recovery process.",
        "The actual behavioral experience is one of the most powerful factors that can drive brain plasticity, and there's a century of evidence that that's true.",
        "But by getting patients up and out of bed early, even taking them outside, Kate Klein and Edward Manno say they're attempting to provide the sort of familiar experiences that are already well-known to stimulate the brain's natural rewiring process.",
        "Those experiences can be powerful, explains Klein, recalling a patient who suddenly began to speak after being outside for the first time."
