        "Upon further investigation, there it was, a sinkhole.",

        "They think the simplest thing to do is to just fill it full of dirt.",
        "Right.",
        "The problem is you've got a conduit into the subsurface that ultimately caused that sinkhole.",
        "It's connected to the aquifer - in most cases to some underlying aquifer.",
        "And if you don't take care of that, then all you're doing is exacerbating the problem, and you're likely to have another collapse.",
        "Engineers, there are engineers whose specialty is sinkhole remediation, and they spend a lot of time and a lot of engineering skill to try to identify those subsurface passages so that they can fill them up with things like grout, for example."

        "But we had a Walmart store right on our main drag, and a sinkhole opened up under the parking lot and kind of collapsed the parking lot.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It ended up making a lot of the stores move out of the area.",

        "And I wonder, Lewis, is it - if you see one sinkhole, does that necessarily mean there are going to be more?",
        "Well, if you see one sinkhole, then chances are that you are in an area that is prone to sinkhole formation.",
        "I mean, there are specific geological conditions that make an area more likely to have sinkholes.",
        "And so there are parts of the country, and north and central Florida is notorious for sinkhole formation.",
        "Western Illinois is another area, western Kentucky, and it's, you know, they occur pretty frequently in those parts of the country.",
        "And so if you see one, chances are - I mean, it's just telling you that you are in an area that's prone to sinkhole formation.",
        "OK.",
        "So if Florida is prone to sinkhole - and if we can judge from the headlines lately, I think we all assume that."

        "Well, there is a lot of groundwater underneath Florida.",
        "The entire state of Florida practically is underlain by an aquifer called the Floridan aquifer, and it's formed in limestone bedrock.",
        "Limestone is one of these rock types that is particularly susceptible to dissolution, to being dissolved by circulating groundwater, and that's what creates caves and that's what creates, you know, cavities in the subsurface that contribute to sinkhole formation.",
        "The - in most parts of Florida, that limestone bedrock is covered up by tens to maybe a couple of hundred feet of non-soluble rock, like sand and gravel and clay.",
        "So the dissolution will occur in that limestone bedrock of the subsurface, and then in most cases, that overlying sediment just collapses into it.",

        "We've got an email that says: It sounds like many of your callers and emails are confusing sinkholes and erosion.",
        "Can you talk about the difference?",
        "So, Lewis Land, can you explain the difference?",
        "Well, see, sinkhole - erosion is just kind of a broad term that covers all these different processes that weather and breakdown rock.",
        "Dissolution of limestone is just a type of what we call a chemical erosion.",

        "It's Gasper in Edenton, North Carolina.",
        "What's the answer here, Lewis?",
        "Well, in most cases, just the rock framework will keep sink - I mean, most oil and gas is extracted from reservoirs that are thousands of feet under ground.",
        "And so the rock overlying it, generally, is strong enough to prevent any catastrophic collapse.",
        "It's - and what takes the place of the oil and gas is water because at that depth, the rocks are saturated with one type of fluid or another.",
        "It's either oil, natural gas or saltwater.",

        "They're transparent plastic molds like retainers, and this is what Alison Smith has opted for.",
