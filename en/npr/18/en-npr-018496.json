        "There has to be somebody on their staff - and I say that meaning that John McCain as well on the Republican side - who is saying: How are we letting him get away with this?",
        "We should be jumping in.",
        "You know, we are better for the country than Barack Obama.",
        "Let's take advantage of this technology too.",
        "Well, the great irony of McCain as the Republican nominee is that it was the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law that first really pushed the political world toward the small donors that Obama has depended on.",
        "The irony here is that McCain really hasn't been able to attract a lot of these small donors, hasn't been able to get a lot of money online, and is kind of trying hard to rely on the Bush network in 2000 - the rangers, the pioneers, the old style of big money donors.",
        "And that model really can't complete with the new model.",
        "Joshua Green wrote \"\"The Amazing Money Machine.\"\" It appears in the June issue of the Atlantic.",

        "On the Democratic side, 168 pledge delegates are at stake.",
        "As NPR's Audie Cornish reports, Virginia is getting the most attention both for the delegates that will yield tomorrow and for what the state could do for the party in the fall.",
        "We're going to hear now from a member of New Zealand's Parliament.",
        "Nicky Wagner is based in Christchurch.",
        "I spoke with her earlier this morning and asked if she agrees with the prime minister about the need to tighten the gun laws.",
        "We are enormously, I suppose, insulted and affronted that somebody would travel the world and then come to our town to destroy the peace that we have in our city.",
        "We do need to change our laws."

        "There's a lot of debate at the moment, and I think we will all be finding the best way to go.",
        "Certainly, we want to make sure that weapons that are designed to kill and to kill quickly and efficiently - we don't believe have a place in New Zealand.",

        "The vast majority of New Zealanders who do have guns - and we are a rural community, as well as citified - use their guns wisely.",
        "They keep them securely, and they're not dangerous.",
        "We don't arm our police.",
        "So this is not a huge cultural change, but what we need to do is make sure that we stop people who may not use our guns properly to get them.",
        "Our reporter Rob Schmitz is in Christchurch, and he has been talking to a whole cross-section of people, including gun owners, and I want to play a bit of a conversation that he had with one of them.",

        "He has 12 guns, including four semiautomatic weapons.",
        "Let's listen to a little bit of what he had to say.",
        "And it's really disappointing to have the government throw on us what one person did and punish 250,000 gun owners at least, if not more, just because of what one man does.",
        "What do you say to him?",
        "I say that this is a discussion that all New Zealanders have to be involved in.",
        "There is absolutely no doubt that every New Zealander wants to make sure we don't have an increase of gun crime in our country and we don't have an increase in terrorism.",
        "And if by strengthening our gun laws we will get to that outcome, I think every New Zealander will support it.",
        "Do a majority of parliamentarians support it?",
        "Is this something - the ban on semiautomatic weapons - is this going to pass easily?",
        "I think we're getting in front of ourselves.",
        "There has not been that discussion in Parliament.",
        "The prime minister is talking about changes to the gun laws.",
        "I think every parliamentarian will support some changes to the gun laws.",

        "So you don't see any new tensions in the country as a result of immigration over the last couple of decades?",

        "We have needed more workers.",
        "So certainly, the feeling of tolerance in Christchurch is strong, and if there has been any white supremacist thinking, it certainly hasn't shown its head since the earthquakes have been.",
        "So is it your hope then that this massacre is something that clearly won't be repeated, but that it does not embolden other white supremacists in the country to come forward and start to undermine the open, tolerant culture that you have in Christchurch and in New Zealand more broadly?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "We are very hopeful that this will never happen again, and the people across New Zealand have been very strong in standing together and repudiating what the gunman did.",
