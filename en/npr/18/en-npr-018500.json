        "So - and what did you find when you put the road kill out?",
        "Did these insects come?",
        "And how did you tie that to the orchid, then?",
        "There's one very convenient thing about orchids, which you just mentioned in relation to the previous orchids you talked about, and that is that the pollen of orchids are aggregated into packages, which are called pollinarium.",
        "And these packages often stand out.",
        "They're bright yellow and quite large compared to normal pollen grains.",
        "So when an insect has visited several flowers, you actually see these pollen packages sticking onto the insect, and even from a couple of meters away.",
        "So you don't have to hang around the road kill too closely.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "You can actually see that some of these flies that visited the carrion also visited the orchid.",
        "Oh, so you saw the pollen on the insects, and that told you...",
        "That's correct.",
        "...that they had visited the orchid first.",
        "So do you - is the scent - the roadkill smell an exact replica?",
        "Is there a way to quantify smell?",
        "We - the laboratory that I work for at the University of KwaZulu-Natal is specialized in analyzing scent of flowers.",
        "And we use machines that are also commonly used in the perfume industry, where you can analyze the chemical profile of a certain bouquet - of scent bouquet.",
        "And it turned out that orchids produces about six chemical compounds, and the most important ones are sulfur compounds, which you also smell if you smell rotten eggs.",
        "And they are also the main compounds of carrion.",
        "So there's a very strong overlap between the scent bouquet of carrion and that of the plant, and we could actually chemically identify the compounds",
        "That's kind of amazing.",
        "It's hard to imagine how a plant evolves that capability, to match scents.",
        "I mean, are its close relatives a little bit smelly?"

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, you're exactly right.",
        "They are a little bit smelly.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So you can sort of think of a pathway and where the carrion flower is sort of the ultimate product of a pathway of fly pollination, and the close relatives, like you say, aren't as badly smelling, but they certainly aren't pleasant either.",
        "Well - but this orchid then knows that it - are flies attracted to it because it smells like carrion?",
        "Did flies evolve with it during its lifetime so that, you know, they have a symbiotic relationship here?",
        "No.",
        "This is not the case.",
        "It's a one-way traffic, basically, because the flies don't get anything out of it.",
        "And, in fact, there were situations where flies had visited so many flowers, that the burden of the pollen packages wore them down so badly that they couldn't fly anymore.",
        "So the fly would do much better off not visiting the flower, but we think that the cues that the plant produce are so strong that the fly simply can't afford to ignore those cues.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Fascinating.",
