        "There's two different types.",

        "And then we have orchids that grow in Alaska.",
        "And those all terrestrial orchids that go dormant like a lily, the bulbs are - things go dormant in the wintertime and they come back up.",
        "And as you get closer to the equator, you have the tropics and the subtropics and the tropical areas.",
        "And those are areas where plants grow in the trees that are epiphytic."

        "Well, it's okay to buy them there.",
        "But the thing about the box stores are stores that are mass-producing orchids and they - a lot of them are filled with hormones.",

        "Is there a way to select the best orchid?",
        "If I'm at the - if I'm at a nursery, how do I know which one is healthy?",
        "You want to look for a good, clean, green leaves, no blotches or lines along on them because that's the sign of - could be a virus plant.",
        "You want to see nice, strong roots and a nice, strong, well-established plant.",
        "A lot of the plants that we find in the box store are plants that come out of little three-inch pots and they put them in a six-inch pot with a lot of sphagnum moss and the plant is not established.",
        "And therefore the shock of being transplanted and the shock of being put into a box for a week, and then put it on a shelf in the air conditioning with no - not the proper watering, the plant obviously goes into shock."

        "And I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.",
        "Well, they probably - the Brassia and the Cattleya need more light than the Phalaenopsis.",

        "If the leaf is narrower, it needs more sunlight for the photosynthesis to take place.",
