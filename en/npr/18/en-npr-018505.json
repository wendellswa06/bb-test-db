        "Justice O'CONNOR: Such diversity promotes learning and better prepares students for an increasingly heterogeneous work force, for responsible citizenship, and for the legal profession.",
        "In each of the race cases, O'Connor has followed a well-trodden path for her: Decide the case before you, make as few broad and sweeping rules as possible, and leave the door open for future change in a different set of circumstances.",
        "She's adopted a similar approach in religion cases.",
        "She's rejected the approach of conservatives who would like to permit any state action that doesn't actually favor one religion over another, but she's also rejected the liberal approach of erecting a high wall of separation between church and state.",
        "In no area, though, has O'Connor been more careful and successful at carving out a middle ground than on questions involving abortion.",
        "When she joined the court, a woman's right to an abortion was spelled out in Roe vs. Wade as a relatively absolute right to privacy.",
        "But less than two years after joining the court, O'Connor dissented from a major extension of Roe, saying that in her view, a state could regulate abortions unless those regulations imposed an undue burden on a woman's right to choose.",
        "Six years later, her separate concurring opinion in an abortion case allowed more state restrictions but made it clear that she had deprived the court's four conservatives of a fifth vote to overrule Roe vs. Wade.",
        "In 1992, the issue was back before the court again.",
        "And this time, O'Connor, joined by Justices Souter and Kennedy, joined forces to sustain what they called the core holding of Roe--a woman's right to an abortion--but using O'Connor's undue burden test.",

        "We reaffirm the constitutionally protected liberty of the woman to decide to have an abortion before the fetus attains viability, and to obtain it without undue interference from the state.",
        "Eight years later, she provided the fifth and deciding vote, this time invalidating a so-called partial-birth abortion law.",
        "The statute, she said, provided no exception to preserve the health of the mother and thus imposed an undue burden."

        "And they captured the police chief and the district chief and their bodyguards and soldiers and then that night overran the district center itself and burned all the buildings.",
        "The details are shaky because most of it's coming from the Taliban's spokesman, but the government has confirmed that the police chief and the district chief are missing and maybe 10, 11 of their soldiers.",
