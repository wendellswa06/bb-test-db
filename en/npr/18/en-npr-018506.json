        "I want to start with the new DOJ policy on medical marijuana because it's been in the news, and it's somewhat similar to Seattle's when you were there - the 2003 voter initiative that made marijuana possession a low priority for law enforcement.",
        "Were you involved in the drafting of the current DOJ policy, and what does it mean for your office?",
        "No, I wasn't involved in the drafting.",
        "I certainly had an opportunity to look at it and to provide advice.",
        "But this is a very narrow piece that comes from the attorney general to the United States attorneys in those 13 states where medical marijuana exists.",
        "So it's his policy guidance to them.",
        "And are you - what does it mean for you in terms of those 13 states, in terms of the possibility of it growing to other states?",
        "Well, we know that there are several other states that are also considering medical marijuana, and I can't go anywhere - and I've been on the road since I've taken this job every week for the last six months - but I can't go anywhere without being questioned about medical marijuana and what does it mean.",
        "And so it was important that we were able to look at this policy, but it's important that it also be considered in the much larger context.",
        "And as you get more data from those states that have a medical marijuana policy, will that inform a federal policy?",
        "What happens right now is that it's very clear - a couple things: First of all, that the raw marijuana plant is not medicine, that using smoked marijuana as a way to administer some type of drug isn't something that is approved through medicine.",
        "There may be parts or are parts of the marijuana plant that certainly are being considered through a variety of medical studies, but we'd like medicine, we'd like medical science to answer those questions.",

        "No, there is a commensurate policy change, and the policy change would be this, is that we've looked at war on drugs for 40-plus years.",
        "We've looked at the criminal justice system as the primary component for dealing with it, whether it's through arrests or drug courts, seizures, et cetera.",
        "We need to look at this in a much more balanced way, and we need to bring a lot of other people to the forefront when we talk about this.",
        "There are prevention programs that work.",
        "I mean, right now, people say gee, war on drugs is a total, complete, absolute failure, and therefore, we must move to legalization.",
        "Well, I actually reject that.",
        "There are things in prevention that clearly work, and there are treatment programs that clearly work, both of which are less cost than incarceration.",

        "And the United States has made great improvement over the last four decades in alcohol-impaired driving.",
        "It is down significantly.",

        "Well, let's use the model of enforcement and education, which we have for alcohol-impaired driving or alcohol-impaired arrests, and use that same type of model.",
        "Those combinations of education and enforcement, messages that get out to young people about the dangers of drugs, messages that get out to parents about how to keep prescription drugs out of the hands of children, these things make a lot of sense.",

        "He is a researcher.",
        "So you have this incredible combination of a treatment professional that understands the value and importance of the criminal justice system to this whole aspect.",

        "And together, we think we will bring a lot of minds and a lot of thinking into the same place on this issue.",

        "Having said that, and having seen that, I think we really must look at the way we're handling marijuana in this country.",

        "It has been from the illegality of the drug.",

        "And we know that if we make the arrest that quite often there is a stigma attached to that that is pretty difficult for them to get out from under.",
