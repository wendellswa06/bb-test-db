        "And I think it's more for political reasons, that they can get a foothold in these countries to set up more army bases, et cetera.",
        "All right, Ernie, let's give our guest a chance to answer.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "Well, on the legalization issue, it's not something that's discussed either by myself or in the White House.",
        "No country - no country in the world has legalized drugs.",
        "And if you think about the legalized drugs we do have, talking about the prescriptions earlier, we know that there are lots of problems.",
        "We're not able to control them.",
        "We're not able to keep them out of the hands of young people.",
        "We're not actually able to keep them from causing deaths among a lot of people.",
        "So I don't think legalization is anything that's going to be entertained or discussed at any level.",

        "Jacob, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Hello?",
        "Hello, you're on the air.",
        "I'm basically - well, I'm sorry to use the term drug czar, but it is a simplification.",
        "I'm basically wondering what your opinion, sir, would be regarding a generalized sort of penal reform in regards to narcotics.",
        "Because for me, as someone who follows politics, I really feel as though it's a kind of a political kryptonite.",
        "It's not discussed as much as I would like it to be.",
        "And I'd like to hear your thoughts, and I'll gladly take my answer off the air.",
        "Thanks, Jacob.",
        "Good.",
        "I think Jacob brings up an excellent point.",
        "Most of the arrests, most of the laws involving drugs, are not the federal laws.",
        "They're the laws done by the states.",
        "And a number of states have taken different steps to handle drug cases differently, whether it's through drug courts, whether it's through intervention, whether it's through deferred prosecution.",
        "And those states have evaluated some of these.",
        "They've looked at some of these programs to see a way of not just using the heavy hand of criminal justice in all cases.",
        "What you really want to do is to make sure that you get people back on the right track.",
        "And that's why the availability of treatment and prevention programs that actually work are probably as significant and important as anything we can discuss today.",
        "Are there states, either because of their own political climate or their own geographic location, that have issues where you see them ahead of the federal policy, where they are experimenting in a way that's worth watching?"

        "Well, I think the federal policy, when you talk about the sentences, if you look at the Drug Enforcement Administration, the use of the United States Department of Justice, those are finite resources directed toward significant trafficking individuals.",
        "But what you see at the state and local level are people arrested for possession, people arrested for drugged driving but also for, of course, sale and distribution.",
        "And the states have developed a variety of mechanisms to try and deal with that.",
        "And as we know right now, whatever state we're talking about, they're looking at how do they reduce their prison population.",
        "And with us here in Studio 3A, also is Jason Forrester, director of Policy and co-director of the National Guard Program at Veterans for America in Washington D.C.",
        "He's with us here in the Studio 3A.",
        "Nice to have you with us as well.",
        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "Well, if you go into jail, and you have - or you go into prison, and you have a drug problem and we don't spend time and money to treat that problem, it should not come as a surprise that when that person is released, they'll be right back into trouble and probably right back into the system.",
        "So we need to be smart about these things and not continue to use just the tool of force or criminal justice.",

        "I just wanted to say that, of course, in Colorado now we have legalized medical marijuana.",
        "It's helping a lot of people.",
        "And it's helping a lot of people who are selling it get jobs in this economy.",
        "But beyond that, in my personal experience, having grown up in Boulder, Colorado, in the '70s, I have never known anyone who started smoking marijuana and then went on to harder drugs because they had started smoking marijuana.",
        "And I know that law enforcement has told us that for years, but I haven't ever seen it.",
        "So I really think that when we're talking about drug laws, we need to separate marijuana from other hard drugs like cocaine and heroin, et cetera, because I don't see that they have much of a relationship.",
        "And the students at the University of Colorado now are drinking themselves to death, and yet alcohol is legal.",
        "Kathleen, thank you for your call.",
        "Well, and I think she brings up, I mean, several excellent points.",
        "And that's why when states look at how to deal with marijuana and what types of treatment systems, prevention programs are available as a result of the criminal justice system, what can be most cost-effective - that makes a lot of sense.",
        "There's lots of debate around whether marijuana is a gateway drug.",
        "And rather than get into that, I would also tell you that I have not met a heroin addict who didn't start smoking marijuana.",
        "It doesn't mean that everyone who smokes marijuana - and that is something I think law enforcement used to say.",
        "I frankly don't hear that too much from them anymore.",
        "So being wise about how we're dealing with this and protecting the public - the one thing I would mention, though, and just looking at my own state of Washington, the number one call to hotlines for people who wanted help with a drug problem was about marijuana."

        "And there is a lot of concern about advertisement that essentially says here is a pill or here is an answer to every possible medical problem, and it's advertised on TV.",

        "And as Secretary Clinton talked about reducing our own demand and figuring out how to deal with this more comprehensively right now makes a lot of sense from a global perspective.",
