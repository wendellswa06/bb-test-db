        "Chu who handles health affairs or did handle health affairs for the Defense Department.",
        "And then the Secretary of Defense agreed with his decision.",
        "Now, after years of criticism that they were not paying enough attention to this problem, the Defense Department and the Veterans Administration have lately bolstered their capacity to diagnose and treat PTSD.",
        "How did that factor into the decision?",
        "Well, that's another big part of the argument is, if you say that post traumatic stress disorder is worthy of a Purple Heart, then they're saying that that might help get rid of some of the stigma that's attached to the disease.",
        "And it's actually - it actually played into the argument on the blogosphere - was that there's such a stigma already attached to it that that's why they were saying it would denigrate it, like some people don't necessarily believe that it's a real injury or that people are faking it or something, you can't see it and that causes a problem.",
        "I think people who are not in the military might remember that scene in the film \"\"Patton\"\" where a soldier with what was then called shell-shock, battlefield fatigue, said he couldn't go back into combat, was slapped by General Patton which caused a great brouhaha in his career.",
        "But that's the sort of attitude that this is somehow perceived by some people as a form of cowardice?",
        "I mean, it's getting better, but certainly that does still exist.",
        "I mean, it's funny if you go out with the troops that have seen a lot of combat, they believe in it.",
        "But if you go out with the troops that haven't necessarily, it's harder to make that point that it does exist.",
        "We're talking with Kelly Kennedy of the Army Times about the PTSD and the Purple Heart.",

        "And that anyone who thinks it doesn't rank the Purple Heart, either - your guest there just said, you know, it's not intentionally caused.",
        "It's absolutely intentionally caused.",
        "We have troops that do nothing but specialize in psychological warfare.",
        "But the main reason I told your screener is that I think that they denied giving you the Purple Heart because then it legitimizes PTSD and it forces the military and the VA so that they'd have to take that person as far as treatment for the rest of their lives for - excuse me, for compensation, for stuff like that.",
        "Well, tell us about that if you would, Kelly Kennedy.",
        "Does the Purple Heart convey benefits as well as recognition?",
        "Well, if you get the Purple Heart for posttraumatic stress disorder, it certainly makes it combat related.",
        "That's known.",
        "If your PTSD is bad enough that it forces you out of the military at a medical discharge, it's automatically 50 percent in benefits, so I guess you could make that argument, but at the same time, people are being medically discharged for PTSD and they are being awarded that, so.",
        "Would they get any additional benefits if they got the Purple Heart?"

        "It will just be proof, I guess.",

        "We're going to reduce what you deserve as a result of this PTSD.",

        "Nightmares I have aren't going to go away, the social problems I have - there might be times where it's better or worse, but it's going to be with me forever.",
        "And like I said, adding the Purple Heart to it would force the military and the VA to look at it, like you said, as an injury and not something that, you know, I acquired like schizophrenia or something.",
        "So, I'll let you get on to the next caller but great show.",

        "I guess in response to that call we just heard, a veteran who has PTSD and says this is absolutely a wound of war.",
        "You know, it's interesting.",
        "I think there's a difference of understanding between what is a wound and what is a mental illness, whether you talk about a clinical definition or that.",
        "There's no question that leaving the country and moving into a new environment that is hostile in nature, as many of us have done for this nation, in itself is a traumatic event.",
        "Being away from our families for so long, let alone being in an environment in which every moment there's someone close by that wants to take your life is traumatic as well.",
        "That's not a normal event, and your body will react to that mentally and sometimes physically.",
        "And that traumatic stress, I would venture to say that every single service member that deploys suffers from some type level of stress but...",
        "Well, PTSD is a specific diagnosis.",
        "That's right, as a mental illness.",
        "And I think the differentiation or the argument that's being made now is George Washington's original intent with the awarding of the Purple Heart specifically states in that order those who have shed the blood by - have shed blood from the enemy will be recognized from all of their fellow countrymen from doing that.",
        "So in that sense, we're talking about a physical injury that has been sustained by a direct enemy, and that was their word of the qualification of the original intent.",
        "It's been preserved for so many centuries of the Purple Heart.",
        "There's no question amongst any of us that even without being physically wounded like I was, there is stresses on the body that decay and deteriorate to the point where one is diagnosed as having a mental illness called the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.",
        "And that needs definite clinical intervention and definitely needs help, and that isn't going to go away.",
        "My nightmares are not going to go away the rest of my life.",
        "My anxieties are not going to go away the rest of my life.",
        "But I don't think that should take away from the original intent of George Washington of why we had to recognize.",

        "One of the positive aspects of the conversation that we're having today is that it helps to educate the population in general about the various needs that have been created as a result of the way the all volunteer force has been used during the post 9/11 period.",
        "There have been incredible accomplishments.",
        "There's been incredible valor, honoring of service on the battlefield.",
        "But at the same time, the way that our country has used our military, our military, it has resulted in incredibly negative consequences for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of soldiers.",
        "I don't think that until we have some black and white test of what is a mental illness and what does a mental illness look like, and is there a blood test for mental illness, then yes, we'll never satisfy some of the concerns about the legitimacy because there certainly are some concerns about people who are faking, sub-faking psychological problems.",
        "On the other hand, we know that a very high percentage, according to some studies, as many as half of the people who have post combat psychological problems continue to grapple those problems without having them discussed.",
        "So bringing this into the neighborhood of a legitimate wound of war, as Secretary Gates has said, as Secretary - Admiral Mullin, among others, have said, helps to enlighten the debate and make us get closer to the point where we can decide if it does reserve the Purple Heart.",
