        "Yeah, well - and back to Captain Skelton's point - I mean, think it's a question of how you look at it.",
        "Have improvements been made?",
        "Yes.",
        "How far do we have to go?",
        "I would answer that with a long ways to go.",
        "And what I say is backed up by what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen bravely said a year ago at a session here in Washington D.C.",
        "at the Center for A New American security speech that he gave, his first public address, when he said that he will not allow to happen after Iraq and Afghanistan what happened after Vietnam.",
        "To have that come from the top man in the military sends an incredibly constructive signal throughout the ranks.",
        "But you also have to look behind what he's saying and what he had said even recently when he, Admiral Mullen, chairman of joint chiefs, has specifically said, that there needs to be sophisticated one on one screening for everyone who comes into combat.",
        "As he describes it, we have sophisticated screening for the physical wounds, but we do not have a commensurate level of screening for psychological ones.",
        "This comes straight from the man in charge of the military.",
        "And how does the Purple Heart change that?",
        "The Purple Heart would change this in the sense that if we were to come to an agreement that it was a legitimate wound that deserved the Purple Heart, then that would certainly address the question that it is not a real wound, that they're quote/unquote, \"\"lesser heroes.\"\" That's certainly something that, a myth, that needs to be busted as well.",
        "As if people come back from combat and they're having trouble adjusting to civilian life, it's not a matter of somebody slapping him around like General Patton did or telling them to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.",
        "Some people will be able to pull themselves back together.",
        "That's not the case for probably the majority of people.",
        "They will need help, and they will need a lot more help than they've been getting.",
        "I was in Fort Drum New York a year ago, the most heavily used brigade in the U.S.",
        "army of the 10th Mountain Division, people are having to wait two months after having self-reported psychological problems to have an appointment on base.",
        "OK.",
        "David, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "So long.",

        "Yeah.",

        "I say no, but not for the same reasons.",
        "One, I have a Purple Heart, and I also have PTSD.",
        "As a matter of fact that's where I'm at now, waiting to see the doctor, but it's such a separate issue.",
        "It's an emotional thing, and it's not so much the intent of what Washington had because, actually, his intent for the award was not for a wounds...",
        "It was for distinguished service.",
        "Correct.",
        "That's actually what it says on the back of the little metal they gave me.",
        "But, yeah, the PTSD - I always call it my burden to bear, but the last speaker was correct about Fort Drum.",
        "Even here at Fort Carson, once I went to the doctor and reported my issues, it took six months for them to find me a doctor to go to, and now I actually go to an Air Force doctor.",
        "But again, I say, no. And it's a matter of tradition.",
        "But if you even look at the army regulation, it took us forever to realize concussions warrant the Purple Heart.",
        "I mean, people didn't even know that.",
        "And traumatic brain disorder, TMI, Traumatic Brain Injury, which has been described as the signature wound of the war in Iraq",
        "Correct, and I have that as well, and I've been back about a year, and they just finally hooked me up for the doctor for that.",
        "So it's not been pleasant, but...",
        "(As Sonny Wortzik) I got a wife and a couple of kids.",
        "How am I going to live on that?",
        "Yeah, well, I don't think I could have put it any better than the gentleman just did that people won't help, people deserve help, and as a country, we have a sacred obligation to ensure that those who come home from combat get all the help they need.",
        "And I know a lot of people can easily sign up for that statement.",
        "But when we start drilling down into what exactly that means, when we send a high percentage of our force, as listeners know, we have an all-volunteer military, as General Casey, the chief of staff of the army has described it, we have an all-volunteer uniform army that is going through a long war.",
        "The natural consequence of that is multiple deployments with oftentimes inadequate time at home, which has the consequence of greatly raising the psychological burdens, the psychological wounds of war.",
        "These findings come straight from the Army itself.",
        "People can go tot he VeteransforAmerica.org Web site and find various reports that the Army has put out which basically says, the deleterious effects for extension of tours - of multiple tours - are obvious.",
        "And then at the same time, when we have a situation where we continue to have an adequate number of doctors and professionals who are helping soldiers readjust.",
        "Thank God there is some improvements that had been made, because Lord knows what it'd look like if we hadn't had these improvements.",
        "But we have so far to go compared to what a standard of care that these service members serve."

        "Well, no, and I agree with that in the sense that we need to make sure that the wound is a legitimate wound of war before we award our highest - one of our highest medals of distinguished service for that.",
        "I see this as an incremental process.",
        "It took more in a decade after the Vietnam War for us to even understand this acronym PTSD we now so often repeat, which in itself is inadequate to describing what are the psychological consequences of war.",
        "So I think this could be a discussion later on where it'll be clear, but it will take time.",

        "To me, as a captain, I'm a mobilized reservist, and I'm serving in a post-9/11 world.",
        "I volunteered to serve this military after 9/11, knowing that I could be deployed.",
        "And if I were injured here in support of the war on terrorism, here at Fort Richardson, Alaska, I'm not entitled to get the Purple Heart no matter how grave my injury, and that's because that's not the medal for that type of injury.",
        "And the Purple Heart is a medal specifically designed for physical injuries sustained on the battlefield, and I just don't think PTSD meets that criteria just like even if I lost a limb here in support of the war on terrorism back home, I don't get the Purple Heart.",
        "Well, it's unlikely that that diagnosis existed.",
        "And when I think it was Douglas MacArthur who changed the definition of the Purple Heart to be for wounds suffered in combat.",
        "Well, I don't disagree with that.",
        "It's just my gut feeling on the Purple Heart is when people see a soldier wearing the Purple Heart, they expect that that soldier sustained physical injury and spilled blood like the other captain said earlier in this show."

        "Well, D.J.",

        "You know, I don't about it.",
        "I think that's true with the expectation of visually seeing someone with a Purple Heart pendant on the chest.",
        "There is that connotation or that understanding that they stood in front of an enemy and was wounded, physical injury sustained from that encounter.",
        "Again, what I am seeing is, I think everyone agrees throughout, and I've spent a lot of time with some of our highest leaders, not just within the military but some of our cabinets and on the Hill in Congress.",
        "We recognize the fact that PTSD is real, and we recognized it in policy.",
        "In fact, there has been extremely in-depth comprehensive studies, for instance from RAND and many other think thanks that are phenomenal in trying to capture the reality that this is real in this current war that we're seeing a unique psychology coming out of this war, because for the first time, we're having a all-volunteer force, like Jason said, that is having to go back, not just close the chapter once, but have to reopen, regroup, go back into a combat zone, reintegrate back in the society, and with a short dwell time, go back, and that's unheard of.",
        "That's never happened in this country, and that has a different effect, psychologically, on the body than others, but I have to go back and say, I think it's hard to pinpoint what is, you know, the intent of the Purple Heart.",
        "You could go to combat in just the fact that you're away from you family for a year, not be able to deal with it.",
        "Should that be awarded the Purple Heart?",
        "I don't think so.",
        "I think to preserve the original intents is to stand before a hostile encounter and walk away from it in a manner that, you know, you should have died, but you got wounded in the consequences of it.",
        "I think that's the differentiation here between who should be awarded that and who should not.",

        "For instance, it was the U.S.",
        "Congress that, about a year ago, through legislations, said that, if you have a psychological wound or war, you deserve a 50 percent, 5-0 percent disability rating.",
        "If you got a 30 percent disability rating when you're discharged in the military, you get lifetime medical coverage through the Army's - through the military's Tricare system.",

        "Once again, back to what Secretary Gates said around a year ago when he was at Fort Bliss.",
        "Why did he open this discussion?",
        "He could have easily quashed this discussion with a single no as an answer to the question of do you think this deserves the Purple Heart, this being the psychological wounds of war.",
        "He didn't say that.",
        "He opened up the possibility.",
        "So I see that, among other things, as moving us toward the understanding.",
        "So you think this conversation is not closed?",
        "No, I don't think it's closed.",
