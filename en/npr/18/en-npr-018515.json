        "He earlier wrote \"\"Down by the River,\"\" an acclaimed account of the illegal drug trade across our border with Mexico.",
        "This new work is more narrowly focused on the life of a single narcotics investigator whose undercover name was Joey O'Shay in a city that Chuck Bowden does not name.",
        "He drifted into police work as just a beat cop and discovers drugs and invents this role for himself.",

        "They just burned out--not 'cause there was something wrong with them or they were wimps, but because most people can't stand living this way.",
        "He could.",
        "Starting in the early '80s, he spent three years infiltrating a motorcycle gang dealing methamphetamines.",
        "He was calm, patient, so good that eventually the city force he worked for lent him to a federal drug agency for other investigations.",
        "But it began to bother Joey that many agents there didn't keep his long, dangerous hours.",
        "The only people who really did, Charles Bowden says, were the bad guys.",
        "Whatever you think of drug dealers, it's a full-time job.",
        "And if you loose a half step, you go under.",
        "You either go to prison, somebody kills you or rips you off, etc. But he actually started to feel an emotional involvement with some of these people.",
        "You know, they'd show him photos of their kids, their grandkids.",
        "He got to really know them.",
        "And so slowly, this line between himself and them disappeared."

        "And then finally, this one woman he got to know really well on the case in the book said, `Look, I have never created a single addict in my life.",

        "She's the most sympathetic character in the book.",
        "Yes, but she's also the one that our Justice Department would make the poster child of evil.",
        "And one of the points of the book is, here she is; she's a major mover of heroin and, by God, she's also a decent person.",
        "How can he have that view and be a narc?",
        "Well, it turned out he couldn't.",
        "I think--I know his doubts had begun years earlier about what he was doing.",
        "He couldn't keep doing it.",
        "I think he wound up where I wound up.",
        "The stuff has to be legalized and people have to be taught how to deal with it, that we don't want to build more prisons, that destroying people over it with courts isn't working.",
        "We don't want a nation of junkies, so what's the other choice?",
        "The same thing we did with alcohol.",
