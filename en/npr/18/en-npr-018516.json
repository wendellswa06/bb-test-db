        "After 23 years as an undercover narcotics officer, Joey O'Shay had had enough.",
        "He's quit narcotics.",
        "With two more years to go for full retirement, he's investigating other crimes now.",
        "And as some act of penitence, he has told his story to this writer, Charles Bowden, who has agreed to keep his name private.",
        "But Joey O'Shay's story is so unusual and known to so many in his city, it does seem likely his identity will emerge.",
        "I have never been anywhere with him.",
        "I have never been in his kitchen at midnight while he gets a glass of water that he didn't have a Glock with him.",
        "To my knowledge, he's never unarmed, whether he's in his home or outside of it, and I don't think he ever will be, because he got involved in a global business, he hurt people in other countries, he caused a lot of damage to them and he can never be confident somebody isn't looking for him.",
        "He'll just have to live with that.",
        "Joey is in his mid-50s.",
        "He spends time now thinking about the rest of his life or casting back to images from an outdoors boyhood, the magic lake where he would lie in a boat very late in the deep summer darkness watching the star-spangled night sky.",
        "Twenty-five hundred years ago, Socrates already knew that the unexamined life is not worth living, but we're still unsure what to do when you do re-examine your life and discover so much to regret.",
        "He wonders about that, too.",
        "You can't live certain things without paying a price.",
        "You can't pretend it didn't happen.",
        "He'll have to live with the damage of his life.",
        "You know, he's an odd guy.",
        "He's studied the map and he's found this county out in the middle of nowhere that has the highest star count possible at night with no pollution.",
        "So he knows what he's about.",
        "That's where he wants to go; that's where he's thinking of going.",
        "And whether he does it or not, just by thinking that he knows what he needs to make him whole.",
        "Charles Bowden's story of Joey O'Shay is in the new book \"\"A Shadow in the City: Confessions of an Undercover Drug Warrior.\"\" Tomorrow on DAY TO DAY, we travel to an undisclosed location to interview the drug warrior.",

        "If you've been following the news this week, you may recall a story about a team of researchers that has isolated stem cells from amniotic fluid.",

        "So do studies such as these make those with human embryos unnecessary?",
        "The study is out in this month's issue of the journal Nature Biotechnology.",

        "Well, that is exactly the question we asked ourselves about seven years ago.",
        "You know, could we find a population of true stem cells in the amniotic fluid and the placenta.",
        "Of course, the amniotic fluid being the fluid that surrounds the developing baby while it's being carried in the mother's womb.",
        "And their answer was?",
        "And the answer was indeed, there was a true stem-cell population that could be found both in the amniotic fluid as well as the placenta, which is the tissue, of course, that surrounds the baby and the fluid during development.",
        "Are these embryonic stem cells that you found?",
        "They are not embryonic stem cells, in fact.",
        "They're a class of its own.",
        "They're neither embryonic nor adult, but they have properties of both."

        "Such as?",
        "Well for example, they're closer to human embryonic stem cells, which makes sense because developmentally, they're closer to that timeline.",
        "But like human embryonic stem cells, the cells are able to grow very rapidly.",
        "They double in number every 36 hours, which is one of the advantages, of course, of human embryonic stem cells.",
        "We also found markers consistent with human embryonic stem cells, but to our surprise, after we started growing these cells, we also found markers consistent with adult stem cells.",
        "In addition, human embryonic stem cells have the telomerase gene, which of course is the fountain-of-youth gene, if you will, and that is what allows these cells to keep growing in large quantities.",
        "And it turned out that these cells, also like human embryonic stem cells, were able to preserve their length of the telomere, which is the little end protein that gets preserved every time the cell divides so that the cell can keep dividing and dividing without giving up after a period of time.",
        "Why should they be in the embryonic fluid?",
        "I'm sorry?",
        "Why should they exist in the - I said embryonic - why should they exist in the amniotic fluid?",
        "Where do they come from?",
        "I mean, they just...?",
        "Good question, in fact, you know, it's been known for decades that the amniotic fluid is chock-full of the embryo cells.",
        "You know, the embryo is constantly shedding these cells into the amniotic fluid, and these cells are also being trapped in the placenta.",
        "And in fact, these are the same cells that are being used for diagnosis when the mother goes in for a, you know, these diagnostic procedures such as amniocentesis.",
        "So we knew that there were all these cells, which were present, like bone cells and cartilage and muscle cells, in the amniotic fluid.",
        "And we just surmised that if these more-developed cells were present, maybe there would be a true stem-cell population also present within the fluid.",
        "And I guess my question is - maybe you don't know yet - is why should there be a true stem-cell population in the fluid?"

        "Well again, because at that time of the developing embryo - remember, the embryo is still developing at an amazing rate.",
        "By 10 weeks, the embryo is less than the size of a lemon, of a small lemon.",
        "So the embryo is still, you know, going fully developmentally in its rate of growth with all the organs.",
        "And it just makes sense that the stem cell populations within the embryo, which are making these tissues, which are not yet even fully developed...",
        "And when you look at the developmental line of organs.",
        "You know, many of these organs are not fully developed until six, eight months into gestation, where the baby's born.",
        "Right.",
        "So could these be cells that started out as embryonic cells and have now matured a little bit, you know, to become a different kind of cell?",
        "Well, they're further down the line of development, no question about that.",
        "You know, you can get them as early as 10 weeks later, because that's really the earliest time point that we can access these sources of tissue in the fetus.",
        "And you have been able to direct the development of these cells into tissues?",
        "That's correct.",
        "So these cells have been directed to become different tissue types, for example nerve, liver, muscle, cartilage, bone, nerves, and other tissue types.",
        "Now I know from your past work, that you're in the line of creating artificial organs.",
        "Like the - you grow - can you direct these cells to actually create an artificial organ on some sort of structure like you used to do?",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "In fact, that's how we got started in this area.",
        "Because, you know, as you know, we had engineered several organs experimentally, and did some also clinically - like the bladder.",
        "And for the most part, if we had our choice, we would go after the patient's own cells.",
        "There's no doubt that the best source of cells is the patient's own cells.",

        "Did they accomplish much?",
        "Certainly, I believe so.",

        "Native Americans are hardly a monolith.",
        "There would people, I assume, who would disagree with you on that and say that there's much more that needs to be done.",
        "For years, tribal communities have been asking for these types of things to move forward or just to hear the voice of Indian people.",

        "Were they just making speeches?",
        "What was it like?",
        "And one thing that was discussed is actually really talking about the culture and history, because we know that - how America tries to pan- Americanize all the Indian people into one setting, as far as everybody use the same housing, the different music and things that - every state has its own unique culture.",
        "So we have to work on that and to make sure that that mutual respect and mutual understanding of what happened in the past is actually brought to the forefront before we could actually start to move forward and build on that mutual respect.",

        "And one of those things that we talked about within that educational forum was actually working through the Bureau of Indian Education with the local Indian high school here in Riverside County, Sherman Indian High School, we were able to contribute some monetary supplement to a program that actually moves forward technical trade.",
        "And I think these are the types of relationships that need to be formed.",
        "I mean, we could keep coming together and say this is what needs to be done, but I think that now it's time for Indian tribes and Indian governments that are in position to actually start providing solutions to the problems that could become models throughout the nation.",
