        "But that had been prohibited by federal courts.",
        "When tribes are able now to provide health care benefits for their members, and now for the IRS to be saying that that was taxable, we formed a coalition, got together, went to D.C., and we were successful in making sure that that was part of that whole health care plan that President Obama signed into law, that now recognizes that health care can be provided by tribal governments that will not be taxable by the IRS.",
