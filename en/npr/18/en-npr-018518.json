        "And when they got inside, what they discovered was that every room was full nearly to the ceiling, and there were tunnels throughout the house where Langley moved about.",
        "Now Homer had become disabled.",
        "So he was partially paralyzed.",
        "So he stayed in one place, and Langley was the one who collected all this stuff and moved around the house through these tunnels.",
        "And he became somewhat paranoid of people breaking into the house.",
        "So he developed booby traps in the tunnels.",
        "And eventually what happened is that one night, he tripped his own booby trap, and some heavy objects fell on him and crushed him and killed him, and because he was taking care of Homer, Homer eventually died.",
        "Homer - How did Homer die?",
        "Of starvation.",
        "Of starvation, oh, wow.",

        "But in many cases in the human body, there are cell types that still today, 2007, cannot be grown outside the body in large quantities, and that's where stem cells come in.",
        "And there are very specific cell types that scientists throughout, still can't grow out, such as liver, nerve, pancreas, and these specific cell types, for us to create organs, we would need stem-cell populations.",
        "Are these cells, these amniotic cells, ready for primetime in people yet?",
        "Not at all.",
        "I think, you know, this is still very early in its development stage.",
        "It's going to take a while before we're able to bring these technologies to patients."

        "Well, that's actually another nice advantage of these cells.",
        "The fact is that you can preserve these cells after birth or during birth, if they have an amniocentesis.",
        "But basically, you could preserve these cells for self-use.",
        "So you can just freeze these cells now, and then use these cells if there's ever any problem with that particular patient.",
        "But there's also a second way that you could utilize these cells, and that is by creating a bank of cells that would be available to other patients.",
        "And you would take this from the bank like you would, looking for a match, that you might be a body part, a liver or a kidney or something like that.",
        "That's right.",
        "In fact, what would happen under these circumstances, and this has all been worked in the transplantation field, you would need a bank of approximately 100,000 specimens to be able to provide 99 percent of the U.S.",
        "population with a perfect genetic match for transplantation.",
        "And that would be a lot easier to do with this source of cells, because, as you know, there are approximately 4.5 million births per year in the U.S.",
        "So every birth could be a potential source of stem-cells from the afterbirth, or what we call the placenta, and we could just retrieve those cells, bank those cells and then have those available for other patients when the need arose.",

        "Dr.",
        "Atala, yesterday, the House, as you know, passed a bill that would increase federal support for embryonic stem-cell research, and opponents are already pointing toward your paper or your research and saying that we don't need to have embryonic stem-cell research anymore, we've got your work that would cover that base.",
        "How do you react to that?",
        "Well, I think it's important to realize that these are not human embryonic stem cells, and they're different cells.",
        "You know, these are different from human embryonic stem cells, these are different from adult stem cells.",
        "And we don't know yet, long term, which cell would be best for what particular application.",

        "Well, a lot of what we're doing right now is really developing the cells further than we have.",

        "Well, for example, we now have even more functionality in terms of these specific cells.",

        "So for a nerve cell, you would want that to do all the things that nerve cells do.",
        "For bone, you would want it to do everything that bone does.",
        "So are they actually hooking up and functioning in that sense?",
        "Well, they are actually secreting the things they're supposed to be secreting, and they are hooking up together with each other like they're supposed to do.",
        "Wow, sounds very exciting.",
