        "It's you know, you look at someone's home that's absolutely cluttered, and you think it's just the clutter, but it's really three somewhat distinct problems wrapped up in one.",
        "First, there's a problem with acquisition, that there is more material coming into the home than is the case for most other people.",
        "Second, there is a difficulty letting things go.",
        "It's almost as if when something enters the home, it becomes part of the person, almost like part of their body, and getting rid of it feels like they're losing something really significant.",
        "But neither of those behaviors are, in and of themselves, pathological.",
        "Lots of people collect lots of things and like their stuff.",

        "Am I in deep trouble?",
        "Well, no, no. In fact, these behaviors are not all that unusual.",
        "The thing that makes it pathological, the thing that really creates the problem, is an inability to keep things organized.",
        "And so stuff piles up in the middle of the room, and there are a number of very interesting reasons why that happens.",

        "If you look in her bedroom, her bedroom is like the rest of the house, which is pretty full, but on her dresser are her clothes, all the way to ceiling, but her dresser drawers are empty.",
        "And what she says is that if I put my clothes in the drawer, I won't be able to see them, and if I can't see them, I'll forget that I have them, and they'll be lost to me.",

        "I mean, I don't do that, but I sort of understand the reasoning sort of makes sense.",
        "Yeah, and one of the things I think that makes this such an intriguing problem is that we can all see a little bit of ourselves in it, and it tells us something about our relationship to possessions and objects and how objects form a part of our world.",

        "Right.",

        "So now she had, in addition to the clothes stacked up rather than being in the dresser, what were some of the key elements of her situation there when you went to see her?",

        "And she came across an ATM envelope that was about five years old.",

        "And then she said, and if I lose too much, if I throw away too much, there'll be nothing left of me.",

        "Okay.",
        "In treatment, one of the things that we do is we get people to identify some of these reasons, some of these underlying reasons why they save things.",
        "And most of the time these reasons have to do with their utility, their sentimental value, or even their intrinsic value.",
        "And then we get them to generate experiments to test out how important these reasons are for them.",
        "So we might ask someone to try to throw something away and keep track of how often they miss that object during the week.",
        "For instance, with Irene, one of the experiments we did was she had art history books from college, 30 years earlier.",
        "And she put one in the cell box and started to cry.",

        "She decided she would agree to continue with the experiment.",
        "And then 10 minutes later I said, okay, you know, now how do you feel?",
        "And she said, you know, it doesn't bother me so much.",
        "I haven't looked at that book in 30 years.",
        "But she had not allowed herself to sort of experience that feeling of loss that was in her case only temporary."
