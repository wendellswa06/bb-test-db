        "So she's crying.",
        "How do you respond to that when she puts something in there and falls apart?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Part of the problem in doing the treatment is people have to experience a little bit of that emotion in order to break through it.",
        "And you can see with her experience, she had not thrown that book away because every time she thought about it she got this horrible feeling of grief.",
        "But in truth, had she pushed through and gotten rid of it anyway, that grief would have - she would have seen it as sort of a pseudo experience, pseudo emotion.",
        "It's really not that important to her, and it didn't have any major effect on her life afterwards.",
        "And that tremendous pressure down there.",
        "Well, that's a good question.",
        "I think they're sort of double-edged swords.",
        "On the one hand, they do point out the fact that this is a real disorder, that this is something these people don't have much control over.",
        "And it sort of challenges the stereotype that many people have that these people are just lazy or just messy.",
        "But it's really more than that.",
        "It's a real, full-fledged disorder.",
        "On the other hand, the idea that you can bring in a cleaning crew for a weekend and really do a lot to solve the problem is a little bit unrealistic.",
        "And that aspect of it maybe doesn't convey the kind of information that should be conveyed.",
        "Okay.",

        "And what, you know, what will they find there?",
        "Are they going to - will they need to be referred to a therapist like yourself or...",
        "Well, they'll - what they'll find is a lot of information about hoarding.",
        "We're still in the process of building the website but it contains the most accurate and up-to-date information about hoarding as well as resources - therapist finder, a search so you can find a therapist nearby.",
        "Are there many others like you who have, you know, made a specialty of this and understand it?",
        "There's a growing number.",
        "There - it's still somewhat limited, but there are a growing number of people who know how to treat this.",
        "And there are more all the time because it's gotten a lot more attention in the last two or three years.",
        "And one of the things on some of these cable shows, occasionally the person who comes in to quote-unquote \"\"treat\"\" the patient is a planning organizer, a sort of apartment cleanup person.",
        "Can those kind of people be helpful?",
        "A professional organizer can sometimes be helpful.",
        "There's a special subgroup of people who are professional organizers who specialize in working with what they call the chronically disorganized.",
        "And they can be quite helpful.",
        "They can't quite offer the treatment that a therapist can, but they can be helpful in the organizational aspect, which is quite important for the treatment of hoarding because it - this inability to organize things is a crucial piece.",
        "Like sort of the practical level and then the sort of deeper therapeutic level are both important."

        "It's oiled the islands, as well, and it's gotten into the marsh grasses.",
        "And I understand some globules of oil are starting to come in on Mississippi beaches, as well."
