        "Well, the Exxon Valdez was about 11 million.",
        "The Ixtoc well that blew out in the lower Gulf of Mexico, in the Bay of Campeche, was 173 million.",
        "So, depending on how long it leaks and where the oil goes, you know, it's hard to say what the number's going to be, but we may approach it, depending on the ability to cap off the well or drill a secondary well, or the many things they're trying out there.",
        "What are, you know, as someone who spends a lot of time in the marine environment, as a scuba diver, someone who likes the beach, I'm always aware of the plankton in the water.",
        "Right.",
        "And you never hear anybody talk about how this stuff would - you hear the shrimp, the grasses, but what about the little phytoplankton, the plankton in the water that's at the bottom of the food chain?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, one of the things is, of course, the sheen is very toxic, and the phytoplankton live in the surface waters.",
        "So they will be -their growth will certain be inhibited, either from the oil just keeping the sunlight from getting to the phytoplankton so that they can grow, or more likely, from the toxicity of the oil itself.",
        "And as you mention, it is the bottom of the food chain.",
        "Now, the next step up would be zooplankton.",
        "They migrate from the surface to the bottom, and so they're up usually in the upper water column during the night, and they go to the bottom during the day for protection, anti-predator protection.",
        "So those would also be affected.",
        "Some of the other plankton, which are the larval eggs and the larval fish, are like the phytoplankton, zooplankton, they just kind of move where the currents take them.",
        "And those definitely are exposed to the toxic components.",
        "What about the chemical dispersant that they're spraying on the oil.",
        "Is that toxic?",
        "Yeah, dispersants are themselves toxic.",
        "It does break up the oil, sometimes creating more toxicity in the process, but you do get rid of the visible oil, anyway.",
        "Now, you haven't asked me about my favorite animals, which are the worms that live in the sediments at the bottom."

        "Hey, Nancy, how about the worms that live in the sediments at the bottom?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, we don't quite know what is going on on the bottom out there, right now.",
        "Our research vessel, The Pelican, is out there taking sediment samples, probably looking for oil, but hopefully, they'll bring back some mud so I can see what kind of animals are living there.",
        "So those are the other animals that form the base of the food web for the brown shrimp to eat, the red snapper, the animals that depend on the bottom for feeding.",
        "And when you say bottom, how far down?",
        "Would it be going down all the way to that well at the bottom, at 5,000 feet, or are you talking shallower water here?",
        "I would expect that some of the oil will fall to the bottom out there.",
        "I'm expecting, though, that much of the mousse and the globules that are coming in shore will fall into the shallower water - because they'll be more weathered, and as they get weathered, they're going to get heavier, and they're going to start to sink.",
        "And your worms, at what level do they live?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Everywhere.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Can they go down that deep?"

        "Yes, from the very near shore in the estuaries, all the way to the deep ocean, yeah.",
        "They are.",
        "They - I have done some studies of the effects of oil in what's called produced waters from the wells, on the animals that live in the sediments, and it can be very toxic.",
        "Once you get some distance away from the discharge, whatever it might be, then there is - you get back to a background level of these animals.",
        "And how long can you expect it to remain in the sediment or in the grass there?",
        "We've seen, you know, many years of oil still coming out of the sediments in the marshes, same thing with the Exxon Valdez.",
        "It's still coming up from the cobbles.",
        "The Ixtoc oil that landed on Texas beaches, we would still get on erosion events lots of oil still coming to the surface.",
        "So several years, at least, maybe longer, depending on how deep it gets into the marsh grass.",
        "And you can't go out and clean the marsh grass like you can a pelican.",
        "No, not quite the same, and, you know, we're really poised with lots of volunteers right now to do bird cleaning and things like that, and a lot of people poised to put booms up to keep the oil from getting to these fragile habitats.",
        "So really, the best prevention - or the best solution is from keeping the oil from getting into the marshes and, of course, capping that well off.",
        "The Ixtoc went nine months without being capped off.",
        "So - but yeah, we're up against a different scenario here.",
        "Well, we're going to talk a little bit about that more, right after we're done speaking with you, but so you sound a bit hopeful.",
        "You have to be optimistic.",
        "Yeah, you have to be.",
        "Louisiana has lived with oil and gas development for a long time, and we, you know, have fishers who fish part of the year and work the oil field part of the year.",
        "There is a long-term effect on the wetlands of Louisiana and the offshore waters, but with - regulations keep getting stricter and stricter.",
        "I guess I was surprised that something like this happened.",
        "And of course, you keep losing real estate to the ocean?"

        "It could be.",

        "We certainly hope that this oil stops by then because that would be really moving the oil around.",
