        "So there is some difference there.",

        "Let me give you a hypothetical question - something I just saw on one of these crime scene investigation stories just last week.",
        "Let's say there's a crime committed and there's a bite mark on the victim and there's an expert who testifies about who may have made that bite.",
        "What is the problem with that testimony and that scenario?",
        "Specifically about bite marks, the committee heard testimony and looked at the published literature that we could find.",
        "And our understanding of this is that there's a lot that we really don't know about bite mark analysis and the scientific basis for bite mark analysis has not been developed.",
        "And the evaluation of what actually bite mark analysis experts do has not been developed.",
        "So, there is a little chapter in one of the sections of the report that discusses bite marks in detail, but I think it's fair to say that what the committee did is it took a broad-brush view of the forensics disciplines, both on the science side and on the practice side.",
        "So, the committee examined the forensics sciences system and made its recommendations and its findings that really relate to the full system.",
        "So, bite marks were included with other tests and tools, basically saying that there's no real scientific - heavily - heavy duty scientific testing behind these to verify that there's a science going on here - and bite marks and tool use and other kinds of things that go on in the laboratory?",
        "I think that a way of presenting the report, I think, that will make it more sort of realistic is the following: The report show - looked at the forensics disciplines across the spectrum of disciplines and found that, with the exception of nuclear DNA analysis, there is a large range of scientific development in the rest of the disciplines.",
        "This is particularly true in the disciplines that developed inherently from within forensics and were not essentially technology transfer from other parts.",
        "For instance, DNA analysis came from biology, analysis of chemical substances comes from chemistry and so on.",
        "Those methods have been developed and have been evaluated.",
        "But there's a fair number of methods that come inherently from the forensic sciences world, and for many of these methods, what is necessary is a scientific basis for the approaches and a rigorous research infrastructure that will evaluate what is here and that will also innovate - that will bring in innovation about all of the disciplines.",
        "How do we make sure that the people who testify in court and who are the experts in the crime labs actually are good at what they say they're good at?",
        "Well, one of the recommendations that we are making about the practice - and now you're going on the side of what the committee looked at.",
        "That recommendation's called - calls for mandatory certification programs for experts, but it also calls for rigorous education programs - higher education programs - that go from bachelors to masters to Ph.D. You need a variety of educational offerings for those who are training, so you need to train people.",
        "And at the same time, you also need to continue the education of people who are out there in the field.",
        "Once they go out in the field, then you need certification programs that will be renewed on a regular basis.",
        "And that's one of the ways in which many other disciplines evaluate people who are doing analysis in the field."
