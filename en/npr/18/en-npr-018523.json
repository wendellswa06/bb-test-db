        "Those who continue to live and work here after 9/11 understand this.",
        "It's what makes our city and our country great.",
        "Well, the - I think the issue is going to come down to most state and local crime laboratories are not under the jurisdiction of the federal government, so the federal government is going to have to figure out a way to help these organizations step up and do the things that are needed.",
        "There's probably about, in forensic science today, something like 10,000 or so practitioners.",
        "The question about getting them all certified in the various areas, getting the laboratories that they work in accredited - although many of them are already accredited - is going to be a significant task to accomplish.",
        "So, you know, there are resource considerations, there are infrastructure considerations that need to be addressed.",
        "And I think that the proposal of the National Institute of Forensic Science or some entity to kind of offer some guidance and focus in these areas will help a great deal to move this whole thing along.",
        "So, what you're also talking about among all those words was money?",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "(Laughing)There's not - there's no money to do all the training and certification, and certainly, small towns now, in this environment, are not going to be able to afford that.",
        "Well, it's - there is money.",
        "There is a money issue.",
        "There is also the issue of having a system that requires these things to happen.",
        "In other words, you need to have the certification mandatory.",
        "You need to have bodies that administer this and whatever regulations exist, they need to have teeth.",
        "You also need to provide for educational opportunities and to develop educational programs in the universities - a lot more than what there is today.",
        "Well, we have certification in one case in particular.",
        "I mentioned at the beginning that there was teenager who was 17 who was certified to become a coroner.",
        "(Laughing) Yeah, well, that's - I mean that's…",

        "OK.",
        "Dr. Fisher - Barry Fisher, you could disagree with that.",
        "Well, bite mark analysis is just one of many areas that - involved in tool mark examination, where different subjects are leaving marks behind on tissue, whether it's skin or wood or metal or what have you.",
        "And what examiners are trying to do is to find an association between the tool and the mark that's left.",
        "It's a lot of observation.",
        "It's a lot of experiential-based training.",
        "But Dr. Constantine is correct.",
        "There hasn't been a great deal of academic study in these areas.",
        "It's a lot of - there have been studies, and some of it has been published in forensic literature, but I think it would add some insight to have non-traditional forensic investigators take a look at some of the things that we're doing and tell us how good we are or not.",
        "And we can react from there.",
        "I think at the end of the day, when you look at things like fingerprints and footwear evidence and firearms evidence and what have you, you're going to find that it works, that you come up - you can - you come up with some information that have some probative value to a court.",
        "Now, what may very well happen is that we have to ratchet back a little bit on the certainty in which testimony is given about what the meanings of these things are.",
        "But I'm still quite certain that they'll be a showing, when the research is done, that these things are appropriate kinds of procedures that we're using.",
        "What's lacking here is to have the mainstream scientists weigh in to many of these areas that we're currently using.",
        "And even though your specialist may give expert testimony about the bite mark or something else, we have no way of finding out whether that person is right or wrong about it.",
        "We have to take his or her word for it.",
        "And without certification, without a track record of what their experience was or their education, we just have to - the jury, meaning we, whoever's listening - has to say, OK, I believe it.",
        "Well, first, there's a process involved.",
        "The court - the judges in the courtrooms are the so-called gatekeepers.",
        "They determine whether or not the jury can even hear the evidence that's being presented in a trial.",
        "And judges are certainly not going to permit things like astrology, for example.",
        "You know, there are many people that read the daily newspapers about astrology, but that kind of information is not going to be admitted into a courtroom.",
        "The question comes down for the judge and the jury to consider is how much value does the expert provide in trying to assist in a case?",
        "And oftentimes, that becomes a judgment call on the part of the jury.",
        "And what usually happens is that the other side of one of these litigations - say, the defense - will bring in their own experts to try to counter what the government experts are saying.",
        "And, you know, they will decide - try to figure out what's going on.",
        "What the report is saying is that they would like to tighten up on some of these processes that we've been using in the past."

        "If I may add to that, the report makes a couple of recommendations that are related to how the forensics are presented in the court.",
        "We're making recommendation that the language and the structure of the report should be standardized and uniform, and the content of the report should also be standardized and uniform, so that we understand what was done, how it was done.",
        "And the reporting should be comparable.",
        "So, that would help in the courtroom.",
        "But one thing to understand clearly about the report is that this report did not look at past cases.",
        "It's not making any points about future cases in the court, and it really focused on the forensic science per se as a scientific enterprise, as an - and as a practice.",
        "The way the forensic evidence is presented in court is part of what we are recommending to standardize.",
        "But at the same time, that evidence is only one piece, as Mr. Fisher just said.",
        "There's only one piece of the information that is available to the jury, and the jury is operating in the context of an adversarial, you know, system of justice.",
        "So, it's a different process from that point on.",
        "We're talking about forensic science this hour on Science Friday from NPR News.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow.",
        "We're talking with Constantine Gatsonis and Barry Fisher - 1-800-989-8255.",
        "Dr. Gatsonis, in fact, you say that the way our current system works, the police and the prosecution are responsible for the forensics, and your committee thinks that should change.",
        "Yes, that's a key recommendation that we're making.",
        "And in other words, what we are calling for is to - for the forensic disciplines to have relative autonomy.",
        "That means administrative and fiscal autonomy, vis a vis the law enforcement agencies.",
        "The reason for that is, on the one hand, the forensic sciences are, you know, are a scientific enterprise and should be driven by science.",
        "And on the other hand, we also want to make sure that whatever potential for bias there is in the results of an analysis and in the context of an analysis, the bias - coming from the fact that the law enforcement agency would be in a sense the overseer and the supervisor and the employer of the scientist - that kind of bias is removed.",
        "I think there have been studies that show that various types of biases, conscious or unconscious, could creep into this.",
        "And that's another major consideration, on the basis of which we are recommending that forensic science and forensics laboratories have relative autonomy.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Barry Fisher, what about this idea of an independent laboratory?",
        "Well, there are some labs around the country that are independent of police agencies.",
        "The lab that I'm employed in is not.",
        "I think there are alternative ways to accomplish that particular goal that the study is suggesting.",
        "And I think that if firewalls are set up to avoid that kind of undue influence, if it exists to any great degree, that may set us - satisfy some of the critics.",
        "The reality is that many laboratories who are not in law enforcement agencies have difficulty with their local budgets.",
        "I think police and sheriffs' departments have a better chance of getting the kind of resources that are needed to support crime labs, which are not an inexpensive proposition for governmental entities to support.",
        "So, it comes out to be a trade off.",
        "You know, obviously we want to assure that there's no bias, that there's no undue pressure among laboratories.",
        "But by the same token, we want to make sure that they're adequately funded.",
        "When you look at this report, in addition to this separation of laboratories from police agencies, you also find a lot of statements in there about the lack of resources that crime labs have to do their job.",
        "And we - many of us sit on large backlogs, and we can't get cases out in a timely basis.",
        "So, this is, you know - all of these things are related one to another, and that's why I think this national institute or some other entity to take a holistic approach in looking at these - all of these issues will help out a great deal.",
        "I think the resource issues an important one, and we have discussed it in detail in the report.",
        "But the independence of the resource is also an issue.",
        "In other words, resources have to be provided explicitly to the forensic laboratories and independently, without the control of those resources from the law enforcement agency.",
        "Otherwise, there's no firewall.",
        "OK, we have to take a break.",
        "We'll come back and talk more about the - repairing the forensics science services around the country.",
