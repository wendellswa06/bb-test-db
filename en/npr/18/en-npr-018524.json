        "Dr. Gatsonis?",
        "What we are saying about fingerprints and many of the forensic disciplines is that we need to do the studies that show how accurate these are, and we need to do studies that show how they can be improved.",
        "So, this applies to fingerprints, and it applies to other forensic disciplines as well.",
        "The actual probative value is something that is decided in court.",

        "Why is it not ironclad science?",
        "Yeah, let's get back to the question you were asking earlier.",
        "Suppose the science was very good, how will this play out in court?",
        "What science's concern is the following: Suppose you have a procedure that detects things, and it has a certain accuracy, and the accuracy is 90 percent.",
        "What science is looking is the denominator and the numerator of that 90 percent and tries to asses whether it's 90 percent, is it 95 percent, is it 99 percent, et cetera.",
        "The legal question is not that.",
        "The legal question is the individual who is in court.",
        "Are they guilty or innocent?",
        "Or the specific issue about where a particular piece of evidence comes from - that is either yes or no. It's neither 95 or it's neither 99.",
        "The reason that you want to have a procedure that is very accurate because it gives you extra credence that whatever statement you're making about this one case may be right.",
        "But it's not something that is 100 percent.",
        "And you would be able to assign - by scientifically study - assign the accuracy of that technique in general?",
        "Well, this has been quantified and studied, let's say in the case of DNA analysis, where you can reasonably assess what's the probability that there's a random match and so on.",
        "So, there have been - there has been progress made in some of these disciplines, but for many of the other disciplines, including fingerprints, these kinds of probabilities - for instance of random matches and what the false positives are and what the false negatives are, et cetera, et cetera - have not been adequately studied.",
