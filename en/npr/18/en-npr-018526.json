        "Well, I think Senator Obama is going to consider Senator Clinton, along with a lot of other options.",
        "Senator Clinton has been an extraordinary candidate, an extraordinary leader, someone with a great vision and a tremendous following in the country.",
        "So clearly, she ought to be one of those considered.",
        "Senator Obama, of course, has had a very successful primary season, and it's a piece of American history that he is now the Democratic candidate for president.",
        "With that being noted, are you concerned that between Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, few other states - he was losing steam as he headed towards the finish line.",
        "I wouldn't take these votes that have been cast as anti-Obama.",
        "Hillary is a very, very good candidate and a very strong leader, and so I would hope that the vast majority of those voters who voted for her, given the contrast and given the extraordinary differences that will exist in public policy and persona between John McCain and Barack Obama, that we're going to get most, if not all those votes come November.",
        "What does Senator Obama do to try and sew them up?",
        "First of all, we've got to unify our party, and with Hillary's scheduled announcement and with the meeting that they had this week, I mean, it's really begun.",
        "I just got off the phone with a very high-level Clinton supporter, a very active person involved in the campaign, and he indicated that there is a great desire and interest on the part of the vast bulk of Clinton supporters and staff and workers - that they want to join now in making sure that we're successful in November",
        "You know John McCain.",
        "You've known him for some time, I would imagine.",
        "I do, very well.",
        "In some ways, he's not a traditional Republican candidate, is he?",
        "He isn't, and it would be a big mistake for us to take his candidacy in any way lightly.",
        "We've got a race on our hands.",
        "He's very good with independents.",
        "He jokes about the media being his base.",
        "It seems to me that with the positions he's taken almost across the board, it gives legitimacy to this claim that he would represent George Bush's third term.",
        "John McCain today is far more in support of virtually all of George Bush's policies today than he was six, seven years ago.",
        "Would you make the argument, as I think Senator Obama himself has suggested, that as fractious and expensive as it is, it sure has created interest?"

        "It has created a great deal of interest.",
        "I may be wrong in this figure, but I was told that we've seen about four and a half million new participants, new registered voters, all over the country.",
        "The turnout, the level of excitement, it's democracy reborn, and, you know, we needed it badly.",
        "There has been such a degree of cynicism and despair and fundamental angst about the direction our country is going and the political process and the polarization.",
        "I think this has been an infusion that has been so helpful.",
        "And then the second part of that is if they keep their insurance forever, they don't lose it.",
        "And the premiums can't go out of whack.",
        "But if they let their insurance drop, then they have to pay a 30 percent penalty in order to get back into the insurance market.",
        "So it's a way to try to keep people in the plan.",
        "So I've seen people joking today, do I use the tax credit to buy an iPhone or health insurance?",
        "You're saying you can't use the tax credit to buy an iPhone.",

        "OK.",
        "So the Trump administration weighed in, the secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price came to the White House briefing.",
        "What did they add to this?",
        "Yeah, so Secretary Price made it clear that the House bill is not the end of the health care overhaul.",
        "Let's listen to what he said.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "There are three phases of this plan.",
        "One is the bill that was introduced last evening in the House of Representatives, that's the start of all of this.",
        "Second are the all the regulatory modifications and changes that can be put into place.",
        "And then there's other legislation that will need to be addressed that can't be done through the reconciliation process.",
        "Yeah, and so he's actually already proposed the beginnings of those regulatory changes.",
        "And then what he's saying is after they get this part of it done, they'll hope to make more changes that could potentially attract Democrats once this has already gotten into place.",
        "And when he was at the White House, there was one particularly interesting exchange when a reporter asked whether the bill would cost more than the Affordable Care Act and whether millions of people would lose their insurance.",
        "Here's what Price said in response."

        "So he ignored the second part of the question.",
        "And that's notable because Republicans other than the president have been careful about not promising that as many people be covered under this plan as under the Affordable Care Act.",
        "Although, notable exception - President Trump did say everyone will have insurance under this plan who wants it.",
        "Yeah, he has said that.",
        "And there are several analyses that say that this plan will result in potentially millions of people losing their coverage.",
        "So the bill came out yesterday evening and no surprise that Democrats objected to it.",
        "But it looks like there are also some Republican objections.",
        "What can you tell us about that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So in the House Representative, the conservative wing of the House, which is called the Freedom Caucus, has come out against it because they're not happy with this refundable tax credit that they think of as potentially another entitlement.",
        "But in addition, a lot of conservative groups, outside groups, including the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the Club for Growth - these are all Republican stalwarts - they've all publicly said they oppose this plan as it is right now.",
        "And what does that mean for the plan's progress through Congress, then?",
        "Well, it's going to be tough.",
        "Tomorrow, two House committees are going to vote on it.",
        "They're going to, you know, look at changes and vote on it.",
        "And then it's going to go to the House floor.",
        "And if they don't have all the members of the Freedom Caucus, then they could not even pass the floor...",
        "The Freedom Caucus is a more conservative wing of the House."
