        "The government of Greece has abruptly shut down the country's public broadcasting network and fired all of its staff.",

        "There are plans to eventually rehire a fraction of the workforce.",

        "Yiannis Gemenoglou, a retired state employee, soon became a fan of the network's classical music and documentaries.",
        "Like other Greeks, he paid an annual licensing fee of 50 euros - that's about $66 - to keep ERT on the air.",
        "He doesn't buy the government's claims that firing ERT's 2,600 employees will change the Greek bureaucracy's culture of waste.",
        "(Through interpreter) It's not the workers who caused the problems here.",
        "It's the leaders who run this place.",
        "They spent years stealing money and they're still doing it.",
        "Gemenoglou is talking about the network's board of directors.",
        "For decades, they were appointed by political parties and those appointees often secured jobs for family or friends, says Ilias Mossialos, a former government minister who spoke by phone to the London School of Economics.",
        "ERT soon had too many employees and no independence, he says.",
        "So two years ago, Mossialos introduced a plan to appoint an independent board and hire staff on merit.",
        "But the New Democracy party that's now the main partner in the coalition government, the party that just shut down the network, also shut down his proposal.",
        "Mossialos says Greece is in desperate need of independent media.",
        "Most private stations and newspapers are owned by rich businessmen who strongly influence coverage.",
        "Some journalists even work for the same banks and ministries they cover.",
        "Dimitris Apokis, a foreign editor at ERT, says the public sector must be drastically restructured and modernized to cut out cronyism.",

        "And basically Kvitova just out-hit and out-muscled her and basically out-Sharapovaed Sharapova.",
