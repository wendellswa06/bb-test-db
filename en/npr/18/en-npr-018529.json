        "They've found many different excuses, which you alluded to.",
        "One of them is Louisiana is corrupt.",
        "Well, there's public corruption all over the country.",
        "There's no question about that.",
        "Ten governors from 10 states in the last four or five years have been removed from office, and I don't hear anybody saying, `Look, let's not put federal money in those states because there's some level of public corruption.",
        "That is a very serious issue all across America and it should be dealt with in a very forthright way.",
        "But that has nothing to do with what's happening down in Louisiana right now, and what we need to do is focus on the job that needs to be done to protect this part of this country, primarily because we're part of the economic engine.",
        "Oil and gas revenues that flow through this state are important.",
        "The fisheries are important.",
        "The economic impact and the soul and the culture are are very critical pieces to what we understand of as the United States of America.",
        "And people down here are really feeling left out and forgotten and really feel like the congressmen themselves and the senators should kind of get focused back in on this and stay as long as is necessary to fix these particular problems, and levees is just one of the issues.",
        "Well, this week, the head of the long-term hurricane relief effort, Donald Powell, said he was not sure that the federal government should spend the money it takes to make the levees strong enough to resist a Category 5 event.",
        "We just have a minute or so left with you, but should the federal government pay the estimated $20 billion or more to make those levees able to withstand a Category 5 event?",
        "Right now we're discussing reconstruction of the Gulf Coast.",
        "Many residents are reluctant to return without assurance that the levee system will be rebuilt strongly enough to protect their lives and property.",
        "What does the government owe the region?",
        "Lt.",
        "Gov.",
        "LANDRIEU: Well, unfortunately, that's just because Mr. Powell just got here and is not as well-educated as he should be at this point in time, and I'm sure that within the next week, he's going to get up to snuff, but, you know, he didn't get appointed until some three months after the storm, which is a question in and of itself, and I'm sure that once he has a chance to study all the issues, he is going to conclude, like most of the experts have, that if you want to protect the vital part of this country, that you will build levees that are significant to protect us.",
        "It's silly that we're even asking the question.",
        "We didn't ask it about San Francisco when the earthquakes tore it apart or the fires.",
        "We didn't ask it about Florida, when four hurricanes hit it last year.",
        "We didn't ask it about the Midwest.",
        "But for some reason, all of these issues keep coming up about Louisiana, and so people here are curious about why those questions continue to be raised.",
        "Well, one of the things is the scale of the problem.",
        "Lt.",
        "Gov.",
        "LANDRIEU: Well, there's no question about it, it's a huge problem, and that's one thing that I believe that it's hard for the country to get its brain around.",
        "This devastation is total and complete.",
        "The breadth of it is just unbelievable, and it's going to cost a tremendous amount of money, but we believe--and I think most people will support us--that the investment is well worth it, and the dollars returning back to the federal fisc over the years will be quite enough to satisfy the investment that's going to be made up front."

        "Why did you oppose that legislation?",

        "We had no idea--there wasn't a soul on the floor of the House of Representatives that could tell you how that money had been spent, let alone why we were appropriating another $50 billion or why $50 billion was the right number.",
        "It was just a nice round number that somebody came up with, but there was certainly no criteria established to say, `Now, you know, here's the problem, here's how much it's going to take to fix it, and so here's what we need to appropriate.'",
        "So you were just afraid this was a blank check.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "That was a big part of it.",
        "You know, the Truman Commission right after the Second World War, when we started the Marshall Plan, they recognized that the same kind of thing could happen when you--you know, you're in a sort of a massive expenditure mode, and so he set up a commission that was designed to oversee those expenditures.",
        "If that wasn't it, if it was going to be--it could just be a person maybe, but it needed to be somebody or some entity built into the appropriations process that would be there as the policemen.",
        "What do you say--I think you may have heard Lieutenant Governor Landrieu there at the end.",

        "It's interesting that he pointed out San Francisco--the earthquake in San Francisco, I think he said, and also the Midwest, I assume maybe Chicago.",
        "He was talking about the fire.",
        "It's interesting that both of those events, perhaps even more catastrophic in terms of the number of lives lost and the amount of property destroyed than even in Flor--I mean, even in New Orleans, but both of those cities were rebuilt within three years with not a single penny of federal money coming into them.",
        "They were done by the people there, and, you know, I'm not saying...",

        "I don't think we should be doing it anywhere, and you were right, I think, in saying, well, you know, the size of this thing plays a role, and the amount of money we're talking about certainly plays a role.",
        "And the corruption that was end--you know, how do you avoid the fact that the head of the FBI last year described Louisiana's public corruption as, quote, \"\"epidemic, endemic and entrenched.\"\" He said, `No branch of government is exempt.",

        "Well, I certainly would not put another penny into that particular part of the reconstruction process, as long as the political structure in Louisiana is as it is with regard to those levees.",
        "The many boards and commissions that are established to oversee it, the division of responsibility makes it impossible to know who's really in charge.",

        "Well, government, in general, is there to preserve public safety, and that often means that the government should have the function to preserve individuals from their own problems that they create for themselves, and that's why we often have the government imposing certain regulations on us that we often don't like, such as flood zone maps that we are supposed to comply with.",

        "Oh, yes.",

        "After all, San Francisco is not eight or 10 feet below sea level.",
        "So we have here a situation that is quite different from even along most other portions of the Gulf Coast, Atlantic coast, that are also subject to hurricanes.",

        "Because all sediments compact and, therefore, they take everything with them down as they age.",
        "And New Orleans is built on this delta, so it sinks.",
        "Now normally, the river would replenish this deficit of sediments by pouring, during flooding times, new sediments on it.",
        "But since 1920, we have mandated the US Army Corps of Engineer to build levees to protect the city, but also to keep the river in its bed, which means we send all those sediments out into the Gulf, far from that area.",
        "Therefore, there is no equilibrium anywhere of this nature.",
        "The second natural process that we have to keep in mind is sea level is rising, and we all contribute to that by driving cars, having lights on and all the rest of it, so greenhouse gases.",
        "Currently, the rate is about three feet per century that these combined effects result into.",
        "A hundred years from now, this will have risen to about five feet per century.",
        "So when you talk about rebuilding levees and dams, let's say, to Category 5, well, that would be Category 5 today, but in 50 or a hundred years from now, the same levees, unless you keep them growing in height, will be capable only of Category 4 or 3 or less.",
        "Now I'm sure you've seen the reports of Dutch engineers.",
        "They, of course, had horrific flooding in that country in 1953, and they built an extensive system of levees and flood protections of various types, and they said, `Look, it can be done.",
        "It's a matter of technology and it's a matter of money.'",
        "Exactly.",
        "I'm glad you brought up this example.",
        "Here's the difference.",
        "The Dutch have build their defenses for a one in 10,000 chance.",
        "In New Orleans, we have it built--that's on an annual basis.",
        "In New Orleans, they are nominally roughly for one in hundred year chance or one in hundred in any given year, but the factor--when you look how they perform for various engineering and other reasons, it's really the chance of one in 30 that they would be overwhelmed, and that's what we have.",
