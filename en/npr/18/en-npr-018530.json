        "But there's one other thing we've forgotten about.",
        "You know, when I went down there, you know, obviously, I don't have an accent, and people, you know, knew who the volunteers were and who wasn't and, you know, they asked me, you know, why I was down there, and the uncomplicated answer was because, you know, someone would come get us.",
        "You know, someone would come for us if--you know, wherever we were, whether we were, you know, in Colorado or Arizona, if something happened.",
        "And, you know, I think we owe it to them because we would owe it to any other part of the country.",
        "I mean, we're talking about New Orleans right now, but I was in Biloxi, and there are people far inland, you know, that don't have any homes, and, I mean, it's coming up on winter, and, you know, what are we going to do about them?",
        "I think New Orleans sort of dominated it, but, you know, all the times I visited--Pass Christian and Gulfport--you know, it's beyond description.",
        "I mean, if they really showed it and how far inland, you know, it went, people probably would be amazed.",
        "But...",
        "Well, let me ask you then just about New Orleans, which has a particular problem, as Klaus Jacob has been talking to us about, in terms of the geology of the area.",
        "I mean, should we rebuild even if we know, almost for certainty, it's going to happen again?",
        "OK.",
        "Well, that's an interesting point, but I think we also have to look at--I think we've just accepted the fact that New Orleans is underwater without, you know, the reasons why, and I'm glad your last guest, you know, had that on--you know, talked about that.",
        "I'm no scientist, but also, I think we hav--any pro--you know, before we repair a window in New Orleans, we have to commit to reclaiming that coastline.",

        "The wetlands that would be part of any reconstruction in terms of bringing those levees up to Category 5.",
        "That's an essential part of it.",
        "Klaus Jacob, again, I think you were talking earlier just about New Orleans and the parts of Louisiana that are protected by those levees.",
        "Do the same kind of problems apply elsewhere on the Gulf Coast?",
        "Well, New Orleans is the anomaly, the worst case.",
        "There is, of course, hurricane and storm surge problems all along.",
        "But they're somewhat easier to deal with because the sea level rise is--they are more moderate because it doesn't sink like the delta and the Mississippi area.",
        "But there is an issue that is very difficult to deal with, and I think your caller really put the finger on several issues.",
        "Let me pick up just one thing here.",
        "There's no doubt that there is the political and cultural and almost a moral need to do something about New Orleans.",
        "There is no doubt about it.",
        "The question is, what is our moral obligation not just for this generation, but for future generations?",
        "Because ultimately--and ultimately means here in the order of hundred to 200 years, so that's only a few generations down there.",
        "Probably a levee system will not do for New Orleans, so that's why I, you know, in an Op-Ed piece some time ago, actually suggested in the long run, it's the wrong thing to keep New Orleans fixed to the ground.",
        "If you want to have a sustainable New Orleans, you would have to fix it to sea level.",
        "You float it.",
        "Now that's an outrageous engineering feat, but it's probably, in the long run, the only--if you want to keep New Orleans where it is right now, in a map view, where you have a chance, at least, for sustainability.",

        "Appreciate it."

        "I find it, you know, amazing that New Orleans has to justify itself.",
        "The--you know, there are several points to make.",
        "First, regarding sinking, yes, I mean, that's absolutely correct, and the Mississippi River actually, by the deposit of sediment, made all the land from Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to the Gulf, and that is now going off the continental shelf.",
        "However, there are plans, and ironically, this year, the federal government put up $500 million for the first substantial down payment to rebuild the coastline, to redirect the sediment, so that co--there are roughly a thousand square miles of land between New Orleans and the Gulf that used to exist that don't exist anymore, and that can be rebuilt.",

        "I think it's important to note that New Orleans has become vulnerable to storms largely to benefit the rest of the United States.",
        "Now that sediment goes off the continental shelf to keep the Mississippi River open, which benefits exports from, you know, the entire middle part of the country.",
        "If you close down the Port of New Orleans, you're going to have a significant negative impact on the rest of the country.",
        "You also have well over $100 billion in infrastructure that you're going to have to rebuild somewhere else, which, you know, again, the investment in Category 5 levees is cheap compared to rebuilding the infrastructure.",
        "I think one point that's important to make here that has been somewhat lost is that the storm that flooded Katrina was a great storm as it hit the Gulf Coast, but New Orleans, the bulk of the city, the overwhelming majority of the city, was flooded from behind, not from the Gulf.",
        "It was flooded from the north, from Lake Pontchartrain.",
        "And the levees that were designed--the storm was not a great storm on the lake.",
        "The Corps of Engineers has three standards for the storm they were designed to contain and Katrina fell short of each one of those three standards on the lake.",
        "The levees simply failed.",
        "And regarding the corruption issue, there's been a lot of smoke out there, the Orleans--if every allegation about corruption on the Orleans Levee Board is true, it doesn't matter, because the federal government is 100 percent responsible for the design and the construction of the levees that flooded the bulk of the city.",
        "The Orleans Levee Board has nothing to do with the design or construction.",
        "That was a failure of the federal government.",

        "But as the--what was just mentioned, the dike itself was built by the government, and they designed it, they built it.",
        "Maybe the board there in New Orleans should have been banging pots and pans to get the government to keep it maintained and to keep it fortified.",
        "But it really--it shouldn't even be a question.",
        "The government built it; they're liable for it.",

        "And that means you have to have Category 5.",
        "But let me explain that New Orleans is sort of the point of the spear of a major issue in this country.",
        "Sacramento is protected against a 100-year flood.",
        "That means there is--roughly in the life span of the average person, there's a well over 50 percent chance that Sacramento and the Central Valley of California is going to be overwhelmed.",
        "And there's roughly a 7 1/2 percent chance you'll see a thousand-year flood in one person's lifetime in Sacramento, which is going to do to the Central Valley of California what Katrina did to New Orleans.",
        "And we need--you know, and as somebody else said earlier, the Dutch protect their people against a 10,000-year event; the Japanese protect their people against a 10,000-year event.",
        "A Category 5 protection is not even a 10,000-year event.",
        "I mean, other nations around the world have simply made a policy decision that these events are so catastrophic, not just in terms of life but in terms of property, investment and economic development--I mean, the Dutch after 1953 were prostrate, practically, after World War II, and yet they recognized that it was well worth the investment in that system.",
        "And it is clearly worth the investment on a straight, rigid, cost-benefit analysis to rebuild the Category 5 protection, which would include rebuilding the coastline, which is something that can be done and will create a natural buffer.",
