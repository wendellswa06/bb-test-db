        "Well, I mean, I agree with you completely, and that's my home as well.",
        "But I'm trying to make arguments that would make sense to, you know, a fairly cold accountant type.",
        "But the reality is, you know, nearly 25 percent of the natural gas in this country goes through Louisiana.",
        "Close to--as much as 17 percent of the oil production goes through Louisiana.",
        "The idea of writing off that infrastructure, you know, because of the cost of protecting against Category 5--it just doesn't make any sense.",
        "And then, you know, to get back to the main point, you know, the erosion of that thousand square miles of coastline occurs not only because the sediment is going out the river but because to benefit the rest of the country, because pipelines and shipping channels and things like that were built into the marsh that very aggressively accelerated the erosion of those things.",
        "And New Orleans didn't benefit from that, the rest of the country benefited from that.",
        "And those things, you know, they were unintended consequence--they didn't realize the marsh would erode.",
        "Now that we know that that happened, it can be fixed.",
        "It's a problem that was already in the process of being addressed when Katrina hit.",
        "So that is a fixable problem, to rebuild that coastline.",

        "Well, I mean, that makes perfect sense for the towns that were relocated, which were subjected to repeated flooding.",

        "But with my limited time there and limited experience, it just seems like to talk of abandoning that city does not make any sense, and I think people are missing the point that the hurricane really did not cause the damage until the levees failed.",
        "And they don't even necessarily have to be that much higher or that much greater; they just need to be reinforced so that they don't fail.",

        "Right.",
        "But my sense of that whole city right now--and it's very sad, and I wish our media would do a better job of giving us a picture of what really is needed down there, but I think the federal government has to be instrumental in cleanup and restoration of services, and then I think they have to be instrumental in the protection against a further disaster like this.",
        "At the least.",
