        "Another approach is to put electrodes on the scalp, but the signals are much less clear because they pass through skin and bone.",
        "Leuthardt says ECoG involves surgery but not going into the brain itself.",
        "We basically do what's called a craniotomy, where we make an incision in the scalp, make a large window of(ph) bone.",

        "The second waveform looks almost the same, but it represents the electrical signals generated by the brain in response to the music.",
        "This is the actual loudness in the music, the decoded loudness in the music.",
        "OK?",
        "A very close correlation between the actual loudness in the music - that is, just playing right now - and the music, the intensity of the music that we're decoding or inferring from the person's brain.",
        "I mean, isn't that pretty awesome?",
        "Schalk says the brain signal is so distinctive you could almost recognize the music from the waveform alone.",
        "What's really awesome, though, is the next part of the experiment.",
        "So what we did was we played some music to the subjects and then we played the same music again, except that now every about 10 seconds it was a one-second silence period.",

        "He and other researchers are using the technology to watch the brains of people as they speak out loud and also as they say the words silently to themselves.",
        "One of the surprising initial findings coming out of that research was that actual and imagined speech is very, very different.",
        "Schalk says when your brain wants you to say a word, it produces two sets of signals.",
        "One has to do with moving your muscles.",
        "And that makes sense.",
        "First, you have to move your mouth around and your vocal tract around so as to produce a particular type of verbal output.",
        "And there are also signals coming from the auditory system.",
        "On the other hand, when a person simply thinks of a word instead of saying it, there are no muscle signals, just the activity in the parts of the brain involved in listening.",
        "And that seems to suggest that what imagined speech actually really is, it's more like internally listening to your own voice.",
