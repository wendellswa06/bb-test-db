        "And Jay Sekulow was a supporter of the Harriet Miers nomination, but what do you think happened to it?",
        "We're going to have to ask you both to hang on the line for just a moment, and we'll also be asking you both more about those prospective nominees for the appointment now.",
        "We'll also be talking not just with Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice and with David Frum, former beach--Bush speechwriter who now rights a blog for National Review Online, but also with NPR's Mara Liasson and with David Savage of the Los Angeles Times.",
        "You're listening to special coverage from NPR News.",

        "You know, AAA has been conducting consumer arbitrations now for a decade and there is empirical data showing that consumers do very well in arbitration.",
        "Well, I think it was a confluence of a couple of different things, actually, one of which was--clearly this issue over the documents was going to be a roadblock, a hurdle, if you will, that I don't think she could have gotten over, and that is the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, wanted some more information about who she is.",
        "They thought the documents would be the best way to get that, and of course, the president said on Monday, and understandably so, that he was going to claim executive privilege on those, which makes sense, so I think that presented hurdle one.",
        "Hurdle two was--and I think this is just the timing of everything--it wasn't clicking on Capitol Hill.",
        "You know, you always look at the political ramifications of things, and I think it just--the sense was, they wanted a lot more information.",
        "They weren't going to get the kind of information they wanted because of the sensitive role she's played, and so things on the Hill were not going particularly well.",
        "And I think the last thing is, the fact that you had a split within the conservative party certainly didn't help anything.",
        "And where did that split come from?",
        "It seemed like a lot of social conservatives were, in fact, in favor of the Miers nomination.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's an interesting dynamic here, and you're absolutely correct.",
        "Social conservatives were, in fact, lining up in support of Harriet Miers and had from, really, the first day.",
        "I worked with her at the White House counsel's office and saw how she was involved in the judicial selection process.",
        "So I was always very comfortable with her.",
        "But there were other conservatives that were not, and I think that split really maybe put into focus this general disagreement that was going on that ultimately played itself out at the Senate.",
        "And what Mara was talking about was that moment where the president of the United States, a two-term Republican president of the United States, said, `Trust me.",
        "Let's go,' and a lot of people said, `Wait a minute.'"

        "And then, as the process unfolded, they weren't getting enough information, they felt, to make the kind of big decision that you make when you're doing advice and consent, and I think the White House then realized, probably realistically over the weekend and yesterday--through yesterday, that this was a significant obstacle, and...",

        "I think you're going to see that.",
        "Number two, they'll have a record, so there's not going to be guessing.",
        "And I think once you have that and the president comes out with a conservative nominee, a former--you know, someone who's a current Court of Appeals judge, I think the answer is that they will coalesce behind them, and you'll see a lot of unity for the candidate.",
        "Well, let's hear another voice on this.",

        "I think that there's going to be now a rallying of conservatives around the president.",

        "Yet, David, to be fair, there were some nasty things that were said, some of them about you, and I wonder, is this taken personally?",

        "Emotions ran high, but I think, you know, for myself, I understand, you know, people--if you're not prepared to have people say nasty things about you, you shouldn't live inside the Washington city limits, and I think the results are results we can be proud of.",
        "Jay Sekulow, on the other side, there are going to be some people at the White House who are going to be a little less trustful of their conservative allies.",
        "I actually don't think that's right.",
        "I think what David said is correct, and that is the president's going to pick a known conservative.",
        "Now he saw that picking someone that wasn't known--although he knew Harriet Miers, the country did not and, more importantly, the Senate Judiciary Committee did not.",
        "And I think the president's going to do the right thing here and that is, as you look at the list now of potential nominees--and only the White House has that, only the president knows for sure--I think you're going to see a known judicial conservative.",
        "I would hope that now you'd see people like Priscilla Owen, Janice Rogers Brown, Mike Luttig, Sam Alito, people that have served on the bench so that there's not--we don't have an internal disagreement.",
        "And I don't think it really--I never felt it got ugly.",
        "I mean, we're friends and we disagree, but I think that you will see the conservative side come together when the nominee is announced, because I believe the president's going to appoint a conservative judicial nominee.",

        "We'll be back with them in just a moment.",
        "We'll also be hearing in a few minutes from Senator Sam Brownback, but we want to finish our conversation with Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, and David Frum, a former speechwriter for President Bush and a critic of the Miers nomination.",
        "And just before the break, David Frum, Jay Sekulow was speculating about some potential nominees, people who might be on the short list this time around.",
        "Tell me, are there people on the list that we've all seen who are--you would believe would be unacceptable?",
        "I think most of the names that are out there are names that people will--that conservatives will support.",

        "Both are men of intellectual distinction, and both of them got thorough the Senate with considerable votes from the other party, from people who disagreed with their views but said, `You know, sometimes the Democrats win, sometimes the Republicans win.",
        "When that happens, each gets to make their choice.",
        "Just pick your best.",

        "We were on the same side of the case at the Supreme Court of the United States, and he served as the Texas attorney general.",
        "He's been a US senator and, of course, he was also a Supreme Court justice in Texas.",
        "So he certainly has the background.",
        "So I think he would certainly be within that list of people that the president would consider, and you are hearing his name mentioned.",
        "But I think if the president decides to go with the Mike McConnells, the Mike Luttigs, the Sam Alitos, the Janice Rogers Brown and Priscilla Owen, you've got a known quantity there and a known entity, and--although John Cornyn, I think, would be very, very good as well, and as David just said, there's probably 10 others we can name to the list that would be fine.",
        "And I think--General Gonzales is the attorney general of the United States, and if you thought difficulty of the document issue with Harriet Miers was significant, just add to that the attorney general who was former White House counsel.",
        "I mean, it just would seem to me unsurpassable.",
        "Let me ask you, David Frum, there are some of those names at least that you both have mentioned that would trigger intense opposition from the Democratic Party.",

        "I don't think conservatives wanted a great debate.",
        "I think they wanted a great justice.",
        "And I think John Roberts shows, and Stephen Breyer, too, that this--putting people on the Supreme Court does not have to be an all-out ideological war, that in the Senate, there's a lot of respect for excellence and there's a lot of respect for elections.",
        "I mean, if Republicans win an election and they win the majority of the Senate, they get to pick a Supreme Court judge if a vacancy comes up.",
        "And Democrats respect that, just as Republicans did with Stephen Breyer.",
        "And I think one of the things we also saw with Roberts is that filibuster deal held.",
        "I mean, if you put on--if you name somebody who's serving on an appellate court of the United States, the Democrats have said they will only filibuster if a person is in extraordinary circumstances.",
        "By definition, an appeals court judge or a professor at a distinguished law school--something like that--that's--it's impossible to imagine that anybody can see that as being an extremist or extraordinary choice."
