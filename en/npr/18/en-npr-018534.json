        "If the president does go for one of those conservative names, at the possible risk of a filibuster, are conservatives going to pull together for him?",
        "Well, that certainly is the question that I personally am most interested in, because I'll be working on that story.",
        "We don't know.",
        "I think a lot of conservatives will come back into the fold.",
        "For a lot of conservatives, they weren't disenchanted with the Bush administration; they just didn't like this nominee.",
        "As a matter of fact, the television ads that were run against Miers by conservatives, which is an extraordinary thing in and of itself, not by Democratic opponents or liberal interest groups, but those ads said, `We support President Bush; we just don't support Harriet Miers.",
        "So I do think there will be an effort, also because conservatives and Republicans saw what this was doing to themselves.",
        "I think there's going to be a real desire to at least look like you're coming together, even if the wounds are still festering.",
        "But yes, I think most conservatives will come back into the fold, but for others, mentally, the Miers nomination began the post-Bush era.",
        "In other words, it was just the moment at which they kind of stopped worrying so much about the Bush agenda and started thinking about what was going to come next and the upcoming fight for the soul of the Republican Party, which will be the fight for the next nominations, because there's no heir apparent, which is another unusual situation in Washington today.",
        "And whether that manifests itself in this next nomination process or on a budget dispute...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...or war in Ira...",
        "Right.",

        "And, Senator, thanks very much for being with us today.",
        "Happy to join you.",
        "And why do you think ultimately Harriet Miers had to withdraw her name?",
        "We got at a logjam on documents.",
        "This is an unusual candidate where the candidate is actually working in the White House.",
        "Her key constitutional experience was in the White House, and the White House claimed constitutional privilege on a set of documents that, if we were really going to know the candidate's view on constitutional issues, we had to have.",
        "So we had a need; they had a requirement; the two could not be met.",
        "Senator Specter, the chairman of your committee, said today, `The Judiciary Committee carefully did not intrude on the president's executive privilege.",
        "The committee studiously avoided asking what advice Ms. Miers gave to the president, and that limitation would have been continued in any hearing.",
        "With an adequate range of questions available to enable the committee to decide her qualifications for the court, we must guard against the Miers proceedings becoming a precedent for the future.'",
        "Well, I think that's a fair statement to make.",
        "But I think also what we had taking place here was a very unusual set of circumstances.",
        "We had similar documents on John Roberts, but it was during his Reagan White House era, and I think it really just came at a loggerhead on what the White House was thinking was going to be required of them and what the Senate was looking for to probe, and just was a feeling like these two were not going to be able to merge.",
        "We know you've got to run in just a moment, but if you were asked for advice by the president as to who he might nominate next, and you may well be, what might that advice be?",
        "I'd hope he would put forward a brilliant jurist who we have a pretty good idea from their record on the bench or public statements of where they stand on some of the key issues of the day.",
        "I don't think we should go forward with these processes where it's just you have an unknown candidate, and one of the key assets is stealth.",
        "I think we should have a good, wide-open, robust discussion with the country on the role of the courts, even on the key issues of the day, and put forward a nominee that's well-qualified and has known views.",
        "And if those issues include known views on the subjects of abortion, affirmative action, things like that, that's OK by you?",
        "Welcome to the program."

        "What kind of people?",
        "Well, certainly Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was a former general counsel for ACLU and nominated by President Clinton, was well-known on those issues, was a qualified jurist and made it to the bench.",
        "I don't see why we can't have that type of discussion now, and particularly where the president ran on the notion of appointing conservative judges.",
        "He was not hidden on this during the campaign.",
        "It was known.",

        "They're going to be extremely divisive in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and even the full Senate.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think the real mystery in this, Neal, is what's George Bush's view?",
        "You know, you succeeded in your conversation of getting David Frum and Jay Sekulow back together; they have been completely divided on the Harriet Miers nomination, and they said and Senator Brownback said, `Give us a real conservative, you know, the conservative we really wanted in the first place, and we'll all get together and support him.",
        "OK, but is that the way George Bush is going to view it?",
        "Is he going to view it that--some of the right-wing groups really attacked Harriet Miers.",
        "Is he now going to say, `I really should have done what they wanted'?",
        "Or is he going to react the other way and say, `I'll give them somebody they don't want, like Al Gonzales'?",
        "The president has been known to, well, be a little stubborn.",
        "Yeah, the president has been known to be stubborn, but on the other hand, he's never broken with his base before.",
        "His basic political strategy has always been to tend to the base first and foremost, and it's worked for him very well.",
        "This is how he won re-election.",
        "It's how he prospered in the 2002 midterms.",
        "This was an aberration, to basically pick someone who was anathema to his base, especially at a time when he's at 38 or 40 percent approval ratings.",
        "I mean, and the support he's lost is among Republicans and conservatives; he never had any support from Democrats."

        "I wonder, we were talking earlier with David Frum, conservative commentator, who said, `Well, this shows the system works.",
        "Does the Miers withdrawal suggest that the system of nominating and vetting a candidate works?",
        "I'm not sure that it shows that it works.",
        "I think what it shows is that the president tried to make some shortcuts and that those didn't work.",
        "He used a different process for settling on Harriet Miers as his nominee.",
        "That different process, obviously, proved to be problematic because it didn't prepare them for all the objections.",
        "And now he's got a problem because the senators and interest groups are expecting a different kind of nominee, and he's a little more, I think, put into a corner here than he was initially.",
        "What do you make of the argument that's been put forward by Harriet Miers in her letter, by the White House and by Republicans today that this was a matter of executive privilege, that inevitably the Judiciary Committee would have demanded documents or testimony about her services to the president that should be privileged?",
        "Well, that argument makes a lot of sense, but there are two problems with it.",
        "First of all, it was completely foreseeable.",
        "If you're going to nominate your White House counsel or anybody in the White House Counsel's Office, you'd know that there are going to requests for documents from that office, so you've got to prepare yourself for it.",
        "The second problem is that you want to--if you're going to nominate someone from that office, the White House Counsel's Office, you also want to be able to--you want to be prepared to talk about that person's background and what he or she has done in the government to some extent, because that's part of their record.",
        "So you want to at least make sure that there's something to talk about.",
        "And with Harriet Miers, most of what she's done in government you can't talk about."

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "And there's a good possibility that this little piece right here was shot - looks like looking for some shrapnel around the area.",
        "I don't think that the White House thought that it was going to have to divulge these documents.",

        "Yes.",
