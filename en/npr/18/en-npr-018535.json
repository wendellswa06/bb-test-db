        "So this has happened before.",
        "This time, it hadn't happened as quickly as it did with Ginsburg.",
        "Other times we find the information takes a little bit longer to come out.",
        "But I think what's really unprecedented here is to see how much of the president's party and interest groups close to the president really just drew back from this nomination so quickly and just really recoiled from it.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "In a letter to the president, Miers wrote that her confirmation process would have presented a burden for the White House.",
        "You can read her entire statement and President Bush's response at our Web site, npr.org.",
        "And we'll have more on this story after the break.",

        "This morning, Harriet Miers asked President Bush to withdraw her nomination to be on the Supreme Court of the United States.",
        "According to the White House, President Bush accepted that suggestion with reluctance.",
        "With me to discuss reaction and where we go next are NPR political correspondent Mara Liasson and David Savage, Supreme Court reporter for the Los Angeles Times.",
        "Also with us is Michael Gerhardt, professor of law at the University of Chapel Hill in North Carolina.",
        "He's with us from the studios of member station WUNC in Chapel Hill.",
        "And, Michael Gerhardt, if we're back at square one, what's the next step in this process?",
        "Well, the next step obviously is that President Bush has got to sort of recalibrate.",
        "But one thing he's got to think about pretty quickly is the extent to which he wants these interest groups to dominate the nomination process.",
        "I mean, typically, they've tried to influence confirmation outcomes, but now they want to actually influence his particular choice.",
        "He's got to decide the extent to which he looks beholden to them, or the extent to which he's going to try and unify Democrats and Republicans like he did with the Roberts nomination.",
        "And, David Savage, let me ask you a question about timing.",
        "If the president were to make another nomination--presumably it takes him some period of weeks to do that--what I've been hearing is that the Senate Judiciary Committee might not be able to get around to hearings for a nominee till maybe January.",
        "Yes, that sounds right.",
        "And they can say Sandra O'Connor is on the Supreme Court and is filling that seat so there's no hurry.",
        "I think that this would be a--there'd be a lot of reason for President Bush to take his time on this one because, as Michael Gerhardt was saying, there have been some real fiascoes in the past where, you know, Nixon had Clement Haynesworth voted down, they immediately came back and picked Harrold Carlswell.",
        "And then Carlswell had a terrible record.",
        "He had given a series of segregation speeches.",
        "When Robert Bork went down, as Michael mentioned, they immediately came back with Doug Ginsburg and they really hadn't done enough vetting of Doug Ginsburg.",
        "So I think considering what's happened this time, it'd be wise for President Bush to actually take some time and sort of vet the nomination before it goes forward."

        "Mara, similarly, though, you don't necessarily want too long a time between the announcement of a nomination and the beginning of confirmation hearings for, well, opposition groups, whichever side they may be on, to ferret out whatever's in the background.",
        "Right.",
        "Although you have to assume that whatever's in the background is going to come out.",
        "I mean, you can't assume that if only you just start the hearings--there's going to be a certain period of time between the announcement and the hearings.",
        "You saw the same tug-of-war over Miers that you always see.",
        "Democrats want to wait a little longer, and the Republicans--Specter wanted to start the hearings soon.",
        "But believe me, the date of November 7th, which they set for Miers, was plenty of time for a lot to come out that was harmful to her.",
        "But look, I think that they're going to--whoever he puts up, there's going to be the same--this is the swing seat.",
        "People forget this is the big enchilada here for both the left and the right, and this is going to be a big battle no matter who's put there.",

        "There's no more Roberts on the short list.",
        "That was the problem he had the first time.",
        "Nobody with a glittering establishment resume, no paper trail on the big hot-button issues and someone who the conservatives will rally around and won't be so provocative to the left.",
        "I mean, I don't know who it is.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Michael Gerhardt, in terms of process, is there anything the White House might want to do differently next time around?",
        "Possible vandals, the kind of stuff around Nalen's job that doesn't always make the headlines.",
        "Oh, as David suggests and as Mara suggests, I think the smart thing for the president to do--and I'm sure he'll try and do this--is he's going to have to sort of take a deep breath, move a little bit more deliberately and they're going to make sure every I is dotted and every T is crossed at this point.",
        "And moving slowly and deliberately is critical; that's number one.",
        "Number two is, I think, is talking with as many senators as possible.",
        "And also, I suspect they're going to reach out to interest groups and try and build up support for this nomination before it becomes public.",
        "That may be a critical feature this time that they didn't do last time.",
        "But I don't know if that's possible.",
        "How do you build up support for a nomination without making it public?",
        "Look at what happened when they tried to have these conference calls to rally support for conservatives.",
        "Everything gets out when you're talking interest groups.",
        "And as you point out--you're right.",
        "As you point out, there's not another John Roberts in the wing and that's another challenge for this administration.",

        "I hope he really does engage in advise and consent.",

        "But obviously, no one is going to stand by and see somebody, as the expression I heard earlier today was, `crammed down our throats.",
        "We're not going to heave to to that, and that's why I think it's particularly important for the president to utilize an advise-and-consent procedure.",
