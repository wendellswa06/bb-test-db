        "There is no history of colonization or expansion or the building of nationhood that doesn't contain violence in it.",

        "Now, it does it in a way that is sunny and funny and full of beautiful music and that juxtaposition makes that violence even more disquieting, I think.",
        "And disquiet is just what director Daniel Fish is after.",
        "The hope is that it's dark and disturbing and celebratory and happy and all of these things thrown together.",

        "To help the audience feel the musical's conflicting emotions, director Daniel Fish puts them close to the action.",

        "There's no chorus.",
        "Instead of a full orchestra, there's just a six-piece band on stage, with pedal steel guitar and banjo.",

        "And so this is a different way of looking at \"\"Oklahoma!",
        "Some of Daniel Fish's staging ideas are very different, says Ted Chapin, who represents the Rodgers and Hammerstein estates.",
        "There are choices that are made that I'm not sure if somebody said to me we're thinking of doing this, what do you think of that?",

        "Director Daniel Fish says Oscar Hammerstein spends some time in his libretto describing the place.",
        "That it's dark, that it's the source of a kind of sexuality and a kind of unknown and, well, how do you do that in this space?",

        "It's amazing how uncomfortable a bit of dark (laughter) makes people - understandably - but it really changes the sort of spine in the room.",

        "In fact, they're more successful than Dabiri, who, as it turns out, is a lousy swimmer.",
        "But he's got the upper hand when it comes to fluid mechanics.",
        "He's devoted a lot of time to learning about the swirls and eddies that jellyfish make as they swim.",
        "For decades, some scientists have speculated that swimming animals might contribute to stirring up water in the oceans, and that's where climate change comes in.",
        "Carbon dioxide from the air dissolves in the surface layer of the ocean.",
        "Stirring up the ocean sends that dissolved carbon dioxide to the bottom and stores it there.",
        "To find out whether jellyfish were helping the process, his team filmed dozens of the animals.",
        "It wasn't easy.",
        "We actually had a jellyfish that we were measuring out in Woods Hole.",
        "It's a place where we go quite often.",
        "And you have to understand that it can take a half an hour, an hour to get an animal in the perfect position to take these measurements.",
        "And right when the animal was set up, a crab comes out and grabs it in its claw and pulls it away.",
        "So we lost our data.",
        "After studying the tapes, Dabiri and his team noticed something.",
        "As jellyfish swim, they stir up the water, but they also pull it along behind them.",
        "And, Dabiri says, it could work on a large scale.",
        "That's because every night, jellyfish and other smaller creatures swim thousands of feet up to the surface to feed.",
        "They may be dragging up cold water without much carbon dioxide in it, and pulling down warm water filled with carbon dioxide when they return to the depths.",
        "So could jellyfish help to combat climate change?"

        "To do that, scientists need to know more about how the animals behave.",
