        "With small engineering changes, we could move the water from the east to the west, and move it from the $20 region to the $2,000 region.",
        "But it's harder to overcome the emotional and political barriers, he says.",
        "For example, Allen Peterson, the farmer in Turlock says people just don't want to sell something that's so central to the life of farming communities."
