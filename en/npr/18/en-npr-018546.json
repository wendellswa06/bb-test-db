        "Actually, the administration delivered what it promised: grants to companies wanting to make electric vehicles.",
        "It's those companies that haven't delivered the jobs.",

        "I think the problem with our economy here is the jobs are coming back, but the wages is almost cut in half, am I right?",
        "I mean, you go back from - you had a job at 1,200 a week, and now you're going back to 600 a week.",
        "So what good did that do you?",
        "And others around Elkhart say while there are now many fewer people out of work, they're still nervous about the future.",

        "Today, NPR's Richard Harris tells us how this new device uses lung cells to measure health hazards in the air more directly.",
        "Before we talk about the instrument itself, let's take a minute to lay out the problem that it is trying to solve.",

        "If you put the same material in here and let it cook in the sun for a day, it becomes anywhere from five to twelve times more toxic.",
        "Jeffries suspects that sunlight triggers these particles to soak up nasty chemicals in the air.",
        "These particles, which might start off as a puff of carbon in diesel exhaust, get transformed into little packages that deliver chemicals deep into lung tissue when you inhale.",

        "And that's where the new instrument comes in.",
