        "that was the year that Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater.",
        "NPR's senior Washington editor Ron Elving no doubt remembers a line the Democrats used after that convention, Ron, because Republicans were saying Barry Goldwater: In your heart, you know he's right.",

        "In August, 2004, Salim Ahmed Hamdan entered a small and crowded courtroom at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",
        "The then 34-year-old Hamdan looked both nervous and excited.",
        "He was the first detainee to appear in front of what the government calls a military commission since the end of World War II.",
        "This type of military tribunal was set up to try the Guantanamo detainees with war crimes.",

        "Mr.",
        "Hamdan sat in Guantanamo for over a year before he was even charged.",
        "And then he sat in solitary confinement for some, you know, ten months following that charge.",
        "So it's been a very protracted process.",
        "It has not provided the sort of speedy trial that the military commissions were sort of advertised as providing.",
        "Four and a half years after Hamdan arrived at Guantanamo, and three and a half years after he was charged, the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court ruled that the military trials at the prison camp violated both U.S.",
        "and international law.",
        "The good news for Hamdan is that he won his case.",
        "The bad news for Hamdan is he will now have to wait even longer for a trial, while the Bush administration decides how to proceed.",
        "One option is that the government can try the Guantanamo prisoners in civilian courts, but administration officials have always made it clear that's unlikely to happen.",
        "Another option would be to deem the detainees prisoners of war rather than enemy combatants, which they're now called.",
        "If they were made POWs, the detainees would be given all the privileges and protections of any American service personnel facing a court martial.",
        "Gary Solis, an adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University, says it would be good if Congress got involved.",
        "Congress can amend the rules for courts martial as they apply to enemy combatants.",
        "So we can have a court martial process which is familiar to military judge advocates around the world, import judge advocates to Guantanamo, trial teams, and simply sit down and start trying these individuals with modified rules.",
        "President Bush and other administration officials indicated they would work with Congress to respond to the high court ruling and get the commissions restarted.",
        "That could be both a long and cumbersome process.",
        "Ten prisoners, including Hamdan, have been charged with crimes so far.",
        "Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, says that the administration should think in new ways about how to address handling the detainees.",
        "Mr.",
        "MICHAEL O'HANLON (Brookings Institution): And that might mean giving somebody else inside the executive branch independent authority to release these people when he or she thinks they are not serious threats to the country's security.",
        "In other words, speed up the whole process so there's not only some kind of a court proceeding, but also an independent administrative review of these people by individuals who do not work for Mr. Rumsfeld or Mr. Bush directly.",
        "One of the constant complaints about Guantanamo is the lack of due process, the open-ended detentions where prisoners have no idea of their fate.",
        "Speeding up the trial process could help quell the international outrage over the camp, that and reducing the number of detainees who do not represent a threat."

        "Well, you know, I have to say, a lot of people have been alternately horrified and amused and confused by first of all the idea that they are modern day pirates at all, and that there is like these guys in little tiny boats capturing oil tankers.",
        "What's the genesis of this?",
        "Well, the genesis of piracy off of East Africa is the breakdown in society that occurred in Somalia, as you said, going back to the early '90s.",
        "And like any other sort of criminal endeavor that you - that happens, it generally needs to have certain conditions which will allow it to foster and to grow.",
        "In the case of Somalia, they have, you know, greed, desperation and lawlessness in spades, which ends up meaning that young men get drawn into a life of crime as pirates because it's awfully lucrative.",
        "There actually have been some interviews printed and recorded with some of the pirates.",
        "And one of them who spoke to the British Guardian paper basically, you know, spins, you know, of course, from his perspective, a tale about being thwarted in his attempt to get an education , being thwarted in his attempt to become a fishing boat captain.",

        "No, that was not at all the end of the story.",

        "Many of the people who were attracted to the party beginning in the early 1960s as an alternative to what at that time was liberalism on the march, look back to the Goldwater convention and say that's when they really were first attracted to the sharp distinctions between the parties and, of course, to the persona of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan, who was always very - also very much a part of that campaign.",
