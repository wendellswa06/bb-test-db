        "Ron Elving, there's a voice we ended up hearing in American politics again and again after 1964.",
        "Yes.",
        "Ronald Reagan became the beneficiary of the energy that Barry Goldwater could not effectively exploit for himself and for his own candidacy.",
        "The '64 convention established the Republicans as the conservative party.",
        "And by heightening that contrast between the parties in that way, the Republicans positioned themselves to benefit in the next several election cycles when the electoral mood changed and shifted against the Kennedy-Johnson-Humphrey Democrats.",
        "But ultimately, Ronald Reagan in the 1980s really brought to full fruition that conservative movement that began with Barry Goldwater.",

        "Well, given that it's sort of - the new figures are that anywhere between 30 and 59 dollars is the annual revenue generated the last few years by piracy, this makes it the most profitable part of a non-functioning economy in a failed state.",
        "And as a result, it trickles down.",
        "I mean, there is - there've been several insights into this which look at the way money goes to some of the pirates, some of the leaders, to the warlords ashore, to political groups.",

        "Can we send ships further out to sea?",
        "Can we send navies?",
        "Can we have them seize pirates, seize pirates ships, sink them?",
        "All of these have been tried.",
        "And in the case of the Indian navy, a couple of weeks of ago, we're told that there was a Thai fishing boat which had been taken over by pirates.",
        "They say pirates aboard it and claimed that the pirates were about to fire on them.",
        "So the Indian navy decided to take aggressive action, and they sunk the boat.",
        "And in the immediate aftermath, there was a lot of sort of applauding of this sort of action to show the pirates who is charge.",
        "Unfortunately, we found out within a week that the Thai crew was still aboard that vessel and all but one of them, I think there was 14, were killed in that action.",
        "So it's very important to understand this, because you can't simply go running around and blowing vessels out of the water arbitrarily.",
        "This is akin to a hostage-taking situation.",
        "Again, going back to the politics of Somalia, the Islamic Courts Union, which held power in 2006, they had no patience for piracy.",
        "They beheaded the hijackers.",
        "And I recently read that the Islamic Courts Union, which is certainly not held in high esteem by a lot of folks in the West, has been issuing warnings against piracy.",
        "Is this kind of a Taliban situation, where the dictatorial group can actually enforce change?",
        "To a degree, yeah.",
        "And there are analogies with when, for instance, the Taliban in Afghanistan cracked down on the poppy-growing, which fed the opium industry.",
        "But beyond that, they kind of stopped there to a degree.",
        "The thing about - that's interesting about when ICU briefly held say over Somalia, and the fact the they were able to suppressed piracy to such a degree, it's the most vivid example that the only way we can deal with piracy in the waters off of East Africa are by addressing the root causes on shore.",
