        "Yes, and participated in a strike without tenure.",

        "I'm sure.",
        "I can't name anyone, but I'm sure.",
        "And what caused the strike to collapse?",
        "I think everybody just got starved out after a period of time and started straggling back.",
        "And at one point, out of about 50 teachers at my school, there were two others left out."

        "And I wonder, Chris Rhomberg, there are many states over the past several decades, particularly in the South, that have become right-to-work states, Indiana, most recently.",
        "How does that change things?",
        "Well, one thing I should clarify is that public sector workers are governed by different set of laws than those in the private sector.",
        "The private sector, the key piece of legislation is the National Labor Relations Act passed in 1935.",
        "But public sector workers, most of them are state or local employees and are governed by states laws, which can vary a great deal.",
        "Many states do not allow public employees collective bargaining or limited only to certain employees, and many prohibit public sector workers from striking at all.",
        "But without some means to bargain with the employers at the table and negotiate, then both public and private employees lack voice in the workplace.",
        "I'm very sorry to hear about the experience of the caller, but I think it illustrates the lack of protection for workers who take the drastic last resort of going on strike.",
        "Replacements, so that is - interestingly, we're seeing that in the National Football League right now where the referees are on strike.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Let me clarify one more thing, and that is the referees are not on strike actually.",
        "They've been locked out.",
        "That is increasingly, over the last several years, their employers have taken the step of locking out workers and operating in replacements, and the law allows them to do that.",
        "They basically say to their unionized employees, you can't come to work now.",
        "And we're going to operate with replacements.",
        "And as long as they're willing to tolerate that, I mean if the NFL is going to tolerate the quality of officiating, then I really don't see that they have any incentive to come back to the bargaining table.",
        "Replacements - you also point in your piece, to a particular decision that said replacements have begin to acquire power the longer it goes on.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, the symbolic turning point for American unions is really when President Ronald Reagan fired federal air traffic controllers in 1981 and replaced them.",
        "Now, again, because they were federal employees, Reagan's decision didn't actually directly affect the private sector.",
        "But subsequent Supreme Court decisions and decisions by the NLRB under the Reagan administration really did change the legal playing field.",
        "It made it easier for employers to replace workers, or harder to settle strikes when replacements were being used, especially permanent replacements.",
        "And it also gave employers, then, the option, increasingly, to just make extreme demands and reach impasse, because the law actually allows employers to impose their last-best offer if the two sides can't agree.",
        "The only option really for the workers, at that point, is to strike.",
        "But as they said, it's much more risky and the strike, now, is much more dangerous.",
        "PATCO, the air traffic controllers who were fired by President Reagan, weren't they one of those sets of public employees who were prohibited from striking?"

        "I mean...",
        "Yes.",
        "Many years ago, in the early 1970s, I was working as a nurse as I am right now.",
        "And I believe it was 1972, where it just so happened that all of the hospitals in the state of Hawaii had their contract run out at the same time.",
        "And also at that time - this is no exaggeration - there was a nurse that had been working in the facility where I worked, for over 35 years, she was getting ready to retire and her retirement benefits was $27 a month.",
        "So we did all go on strike at the same time.",
        "There was chaos.",
        "They made the doctors come in and pass out medicines.",
        "They made the supervisors go out on the floor and give bed baths and empty bed pans.",
        "The strike was over in three days.",
        "Three days?",
        "Because - in three days.",
        "As a result, all the doctors were having fist fights because they couldn't read each other's orders.",
        "It was chaos.",
        "But as a result of that strike, never again did they ever allow the hospital contracts to run out at the same time.",
        "And we lost a lot of power because one hospital can be on strike, people can go to another hospital.",
        "It's not like here where all the hospitals are under (unintelligible), or the majority of the hospitals are under NCH, these are individual hospitals.",
        "I see.",
        "It's interesting, Chris Rhomberg, there in the city of New York, for many years, all of the public employees - the transit unions for example - their contracts all run out at midnight, New Year's Eve.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, remember, in New York State, there are also severe sanctions for striking for public employees.",
        "And there was a transit worker strike here a few years ago, and the union faced severe financial penalties for the short-lived strike that they went on.",
        "So, Lea, would you..",
        "Yeah.",
        "...would you say that strike was effective?",
        "Oh, it was very effective.",
        "People were writing in letters to the editor, saying, pay them what they want - we weren't asking for much.",
        "But they treated us - I was actually one of the negotiators.",
        "The people that were negotiating for the hospitals and their head negotiator treated us so badly when we were in negotiation meetings that it was really pitiful.",
        "We would discuss something, they would go out and put out a press release, making all kinds of false claims of what we were requesting.",
        "But the thing was, the head negotiator ended up in my operating room one day.",
        "I was an operating room nurse."

        "And here's an email that we have from Bryan(ph) in Dallas: Does your guest think air traffic controllers, or cardiovascular surgeons or nurses should have the right to strike?",
        "To what extend should the right to strike be protected?",
        "What professions should be exempt?",
        "As you asking me that question?",
        "Well, the caller - the emailer is, yeah.",
        "OK.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, look, I think that the bottom line is, should the workers themselves should have the right to decide whether they want to belong to a union?",
        "It certainly didn't really be up to the rest of us to decide.",
        "Well, to belong to a union is one thing.",
        "Should the unions have the right to strike when they're police, or firefighters or air traffic controllers?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, sure as any other forms of dispute mediation, or arbitration or conflict resolution, then the way the system has been set up in the U.S.",
        "is the government usually doesn't intervene, then, to try to bring about a settlement.",
        "It's really left up to the parties themselves.",
        "So without the right to strike, a crucial element has been missing.",
        "Now, with regard to the previous caller, the woman who was the nurse, many times, the issue is in service, occupations and professions like that is not really about the wages, or not solely about the wages, but the conditions at work, you know, the staffing, for example, or the quality of service.",
        "And people who are working in those professions, you know, feel a real obligation to their patients or to their students, in the case of the teacher, and may have real conflicts about this.",
        "But in part, what they're doing is they see unionization and, ultimately, their right to strike as another way to have a voice in the workplace and to the defend conditions that they see are important."
