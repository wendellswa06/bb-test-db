        "And some states do allow for that, that they may prohibit the right to strike for certain public sector employees, but there are fallback mechanisms.",
        "OK.",

        "I mean, if you're saying that, you know, companies should compete on the basis of cheapest costs, you know, just sent it out to anywhere in the world that's the cheapest labor in order to reduce cost, then you'll get the kind of situation that we have.",
        "But if you base the appeal of your products or services on the quality, you know, of the products or services, you know, then when you have in interest in maintaining stability among your employees and investing in your employees and retaining experienced workers in not contracting out, but negotiating with workers in order to raise productivity, you know.",
        "So I think that unionization and collective bargaining are a key piece of the latter strategy, and it's a much more high road on the economic development.",
