        "CS1 EDWARDS: Yeah, yeah.",
        "And for the most part, creativity lies in making outstanding food with very simple ingredients.",
        "I learned so much just working on the ship.",
        "You have 300 people, you know, that are cooks, but everyone brings all this diversity of culture.",

        "Some people are from Latin America.",

        "CS1 EDWARDS: For today, I brought in a sauteed skate meuniere with potato gnocchi as my main course.",
        "Sounds delicious.",
        "Where do we start?",
        "CS1 EDWARDS: Well, the first thing I would do is I'd start on the potato gnocchi.",
        "Gnocchi is a pasta made from potatoes.",
        "CS1 EDWARDS: So what you need to do is you need to cook potatoes.",
        "Take out the pulp.",
        "You know, take out the meat of the potato, and I would run it through a ricer.",
        "And if you don't have that, I guess, you just would have to mash it very finely?",
        "CS1 EDWARDS: You could take a colander and just push it down through the colander, and it will fall through.",
        "And basically, what you're going to do is you're going to take the potato and add your four tablespoons of parmesan cheese, and then you add your salt and your nutmeg and your pepper to it, and you want to slowly incorporate the flour."

        "You don't want to develop too much gluten from the flour or else it becomes kind of hard.",
        "So you work it until it's smooth by cutting it with a dough knife and sprinkling the flour on until there's no flour left, and it should be soft and smooth at the end.",
        "And it's almost like making biscuits.",
        "Like, you don't want to touch it too much or work with it too much.",
        "Now, don't worry about trying to remember all the details.",
        "The recipe is at our Web site, npr.org.",
        "After the gnocchi is made, you cut the dough into small pieces and drop them in boiling water until they float to the surface.",
        "You can leave those gnocchi on the side as we move onto the next part of the meal, the skate.",
        "And if skate sounds more like a verb than a fish, here's a quick description.",
        "It's a flakey, white fish, and it's very affordable.",
        "But if you can't find it where you live, CS1 Edwards suggests using flounder, which is similar in texture and in taste.",
        "For the preparation, dredge the skate in a little flour and then pan-fry it with butter.",
        "And for the simple sauce, save that cooked butter and add a little lemon and some chopped parsley.",
        "In no time, you've got dinner.",
        "CS1 EDWARDS: Put your skate on top of the gnocchi, and put a little bit more butter on top of that, and it's a classic preparation, and you've done it with a very cheap ingredient that is delicious.",
        "I mean, skate is the most tender, succulent fish there is, I believe.",
        "I mean, I love it.",
        "We've used it in meals, and people are just blown away by it.",
        "Classic, but how cheap?",
        "CS1 Edwards spent $9.75 on his meal, under our $10 limit.",
        "And though we didn't mention it here, that total includes another course, a cream of asparagus soup.",
        "You can find the recipe for that soup, along with the recipe for skate meuniere and potato gnocchi at npr.org.",
        "And while you're there, you can participate in the How Low Can You Go challenge by submitting your recipe for meals that cost $10 or less.",
        "Obesity in an older child or an adolescent is pretty easy to diagnose.",
        "NPR's Deborah Franklin talks to a pediatric expert about when parents should be concerned about a pudgy baby.",

        "He really made sure that African Americans had an opportunity, so he went specifically to Howard to recruit people.",
        "And I think - I mean, I think one of the reasons I was privileged enough to be able to work for him was because I was the editor-in-chief of the Civil Rights Law Review, and so he knew that I was committed to the cause.",
        "But he really was known for uplifting the clerks that came behind - you know, the African American clerks in particular, obviously - who wanted to work for a court of appeals judge because it's a high-level clerkship.",
        "And he wanted to make sure the door was open for them.",
        "How would you want people to think about Judge Keith and his legacy?",
        "I can only answer this in the immediate context because I'm so struck by the parallels with his decisions that were all about transparency in government and sort of what is happening today politically in Washington, D.C., and the failure to respond to subpoenas and all that.",
        "I mean, he wrote some amazing decisions that had - that I think led to The Washington Post's motto being democracy dies in darkness.",
        "He wrote democracy dies behind closed doors because he had written decisions about transparency in government which will live long beyond his time on the bench and his life on earth.",

        "2017 was the year China got serious about fighting pollution.",

        "You've seen pictures of murky skies at midday thick with smoke and soot, Chinese pedestrians venturing out in masks.",

        "I began hearing about this in the summer when a foreign businessman that I know in the plastics industry told me that his entire supply chain here in China had suddenly been just shut down.",
        "The factories that make his product, his company exports were all located in one city in northern China.",
        "And he told me environmental inspectors sent from Beijing had just come to the city, a city of, like, 5 million people, and shut down most of the city's factories by turning off entire sections of the electrical grid.",
        "And these factories were shut down for inspections for an entire month.",
        "And when he went up there to see what was going on, he said it was the first time he had ever seen a blue sky over the city and stars at night because, for the first time, there was no air pollution.",
        "I looked into this further, and I realized this was not an isolated case.",
        "This year, China's government has sent inspection teams to cities throughout the country.",
        "And they were doing the same thing wherever they went, shutting down factories, inspecting them.",
        "And many of these factories have now been closed permanently because they weren't following environmental laws.",
        "Does China have new environmental laws, or were these laws always on the books and never enforced?",
        "What happened?",
        "Well, this is a case of China's government finally implementing its own laws.",
        "In the past, they'd only bother to enforce environmental laws when Beijing was hosting the Olympics or a high-profile international summit was in town.",
        "But in the past year, we've seen a deliberate, systematic strategy by China's government to rein in polluters and to put in place a better system of real-time environmental monitoring and enforcement.",
        "You know, in the process, tens of thousands of factories have been shut down.",
        "And the fines that many businesses have to pay are so much that many factories are choosing to just call it quits.",
        "Why is this happening now?",
        "You know, well, part of this is China wanting to be seen as a proper global power by the rest of the world.",
        "China's taking a leadership role globally with climate change as the U.S.",
        "steps down from its role.",
        "And it's also making record investments in solar, wind.",
        "And it's also got this new carbon trading scheme.",
        "But when it comes to pollution - when Xi Jinping became China's leader, the state of China's environment had never been worse.",
        "Air pollution was closing down airports, highways, schools.",
        "And water and soil pollution were at toxic and really unsustainable levels.",
        "And all of this was really bothering China's growing middle class.",
        "So in essence, the environment had become a stability issue for China's Communist Party and the elite who had profited from China's rise.",
        "I spoke to environmental lawyer Peter Corne about this.",
        "And here's what he had to say.",
        "Let's face it.",
        "The people who made a lot of money big time from dirty, private enterprises - they made their money, got the kids educated overseas.",
        "And they're following them, and they're saying goodbye to China.",
        "So they're leaving all the poor, common people to deal with the mess and who'll die from cancer.",
        "I mean, that's not a good message at all.",
        "This campaign, a lot of it, is to show people the government cares, and it wants to do something about their well-being.",
        "So this big environmental cleanup is coming late.",
        "It sounds like it's a fairly draconian solution to China's problems.",
        "But is it working?",
        "Yeah, it is.",
        "You know, I've lived here in Shanghai for eight years.",
        "And while it's still very smoggy, this year has been less so than previous years.",
        "Same goes for Beijing, which has more notoriously bad air.",
        "Still, you know, that doesn't mean that China's work is done.",
        "The air quality here and in other Chinese cities is still largely terrible.",
        "And so is the state of China's waterways and soil.",
        "So there's still a lot of work to be done.",
        "But when - someday when historians look back at the rise of China, they're going to point to the year 2017 as the year when China's government started getting serious about cleaning up its own environment."

        "The best way to keep tabs on whether or not your baby's weight is within normal bounds is to check in frequently with a pediatrician.",
