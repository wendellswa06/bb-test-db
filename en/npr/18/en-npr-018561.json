        "Quote, The decision did not give law enforcement the tools necessary to protect the American people - just simply don't see the world the way we do, end quote.",
        "Of course.",
        "He's dancing.",
        "I mean yesterday, you know, what we often call a butt dance, where you're sitting in the chair and someone's asking the tough questions and you start squirming and squirming and squirming.",
        "That's what it was.",
        "I mean, look, here's a guy who also said in trying to defend invading Iraq: well, Saddam Hussein didn't give the order and no one in my administration never said that.",
        "I mean he was dancing all over the place, and he is trying desperately to defend what has happened.",
        "And the reality is, there's nowhere in the world you're going to find democracy being successful unless it came from the bottom up.",
        "You do not go in and just say, we're going to put it in ourselves.",
        "And so he's dancing all over the place.",
        "And it looked pretty pitiful yesterday, it really did, how he was trying to find just some kind of answer to explain a way exactly his erroneous and bad foreign policy.",
        "Well, Mary, one of the things that he said unequivocally is that defeat in Iraq is unacceptable because in his mind it would give a boost to terrorists psychologically and physically.",
        "Right, Ed.",
        "I found the whole press conference insulting.",
        "Maybe a butt dance or whatever, but I was simply insulted.",
        "My intelligence was insulted by the whole thing.",
        "The latest answer as to why we're there and why we can't leave is because we are trying to keep Iraq from being a failed terrorist haven, and that's why we're there and that's why we have to stay there.",
        "And that's the latest in the explanations.",
        "I mean this is a new one.",
        "I'm not aware that Iraq was a failed terrorist haven before we went there, so my intelligence was insulted.",
        "And piecing all those things together, I think it's in part - he had a press conference, it's in part about poll numbers.",
        "Some poll gave him two points up, a blip up to 42 percent or something.",
        "And it's about the election that's coming up and explaining away everything in the hope the Republicans can keep the Congress.",
        "But I found the answers that he gave were totally insulting to the intelligence of anyone who's watched this.",
        "And as for Judge Taylor out there with that opinion that she wrote, they've tried to demonize her.",
        "I understand how right-wing Republicans do that.",
        "They've tried to do it to me from time to time.",
        "But you would've thought she was some demon dragged up from hell someplace because she had the temerity to hand down this decision.",
        "And it will be decided ultimately by the Supreme Court, but she has a reputation as a good judge.",
        "And that kind of demonization and those kinds of answers he gave to everything yesterday, anybody who's followed all of this should've been insulted.",
        "Jeff, what of the idea that this is such a complex issue?",
        "That no matter what you do the administration, whether it's this one, previous ones or future ones is going to have a hell of a time trying to explain why you're in a particular place and this is just a different world than we're used to?"

        "It is a different world, but I listen to the words that the president uses sometimes and it makes me shiver.",
        "I think one of the quotes that he said is if we ever give up the desire to help people live in a free society, we have lost our soul as a nation.",
        "And to me, it hurts me spiritually to hear a person refer to a soul as a nation, giving up a desire to help people who want to live in a free society.",
        "And you're in America, in a place where you're supposed to be a free society and you want to eavesdrop on people and you want to oppress and suppress them by a domestic program that takes away their freedom in the name of security.",
        "So we lost our soul as a nation by doing that kind of thing, and going out and trying to impose the same thing on the rest of the world is offensive not only to the rest of the world but it's offensive to the soul of the nation.",
        "So when I hear those quotes - and then the quote that you said was very important.",
        "I don't want to miss the importance of it.",
        "Those who herald to the decision to not give law enforcement the tools necessary to protect the American people just simply don't see the world of the way we do.",
        "The question in that is who is we?",
        "Because most of the people who herald the decision are freethinking citizens, the majority of the country who believe that that is offensive.",
        "So who is the we in that?",
        "There was all that dancing about one whether there's civil war in Iraq too, another insult to our intelligence.",
        "When in Bosnia when we had Muslims fighting against Christians and we had ethnic cleansing, we called it a civil war.",
        "In Iraq, you have Sunnis and Shiites and all kinds of people killing each other, hundreds every day.",
        "And he was telling us, the American people, that now, now, now, that's not really a civil war.",
        "Right.",
        "So, I mean, I guess this is a question, but does this mean that people should think twice before they feed birds because they're having an influence on evolution?",
        "In other words, things - or whatever he happens to think they are, whenever he happens to make up something on a given day, and we're all supposed to act as if we believe it.",
        "And then there's the spectacle of the people in the administration with their incompetence.",
        "When I look at Michael Chertoff talking about terrorism and suppressing it and what's important, I think about New Orleans and the hurricane and homeland security.",
        "So you've got incompetence and ineptitude and inefficiency, and then insult to add to it.",
        "I guess that's four I's, right?",
        "Let me ask this: one of the things, Roland, that we saw - and we're going to kind of come back around as we move to this press conference - but one of the things that we saw during the press conference was the domestic side of this administration's problem.",
        "Much of the white-hot light now being focused back on Katrina and New Orleans and the Gulf Coast region as we get ready to celebrate that first year anniversary.",
        "The president was asked about that, but interesting enough Ray Nagin spoke last week to the National Association of Black Journalists, their convention there.",
        "And his suggestion was that the federal government, federal and state aid to the city has been inadequate and comes with too many rules, he said.",
        "There sounds like a lot of finger pointing."
