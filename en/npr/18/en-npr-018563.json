        "If you've ever studied evolution, you've no doubt heard of Darwin's finches, a handful of related bird species he collected in the Galapagos.",
        "It turns out that the birds all came from a common ancestor, but through the years, one generation after another, the birds' beaks began to change into all sorts of shapes and sizes - pointy ones, stubby ones, slender ones - to take advantage of different conditions and foods on the different islands.",
        "Eventually the finches developed into distinct species adapting to fit their particular environmental niche.",
        "But evolution didn't stop with Darwin.",
        "Modern birds are just as ready to evolve if they find a new food source, and it looks like at least one species of birds has been doing that today.",
        "It's evolving to take advantage of all the bird foods set out in feeders in England over the winter.",
        "My next guest has been tracking the changes of these species, a small warbler called a Black Cap.",
        "His research appears in the journal Current Biology.",
        "Martin Schaefer is the author of that article in Current Biology.",
        "He is an associate professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Freiberg in Germany.",
        "He joins us over the phone.",
        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Schaefer.",
        "Hello, thank you very much.",
        "And I want to invite the audience to join us, our conversation about the Black Caps.",
        "The number is 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK.",
        "If you're on Twitter, you can tweet us with your question by writing the @ sign, followed by scifri.",
        "And if you want more information about what we we'll be talking about this hour, go to our Web site, www.sciencfriday.com, where you'll find links to our topic.",
        "So Dr. Schaefer, tell us about these birds.",
        "When did they start migrating to England and was that normal for them or did they decide they'd like to go have the bird food in England?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, the birds started to migrate first to England in the 1960s.",
        "So it's about 50 years ago.",
        "And traditionally they go to the warmer areas in the western Mediterranean area that is mainly Spain.",
        "And obviously, the birds didn't know they're going to be fed in England.",
        "But what happened is that the eventual bird turned up in England and found a very good food supply there, and because of this species we know that the migratory orientation is genetically termed.",
        "It gave that migratory route to its offspring, which also then migrated to England and survived (unintelligible) the winter owing to the bird food."

        "I see.",
        "So just to be clear, these are birds that normally live in the summer in Germany.",
        "Right.",
        "And in the winter they fly to southern Europe where it's warmer, but some of them, for reasons best known to themselves, flew north and found themselves in England.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Yeah, that's even getting a more complex story because now we even find some birds that go as far north as Iceland and over winter in Reykjavik City, where they're also fed.",
        "So it's an extremely strange behavior if you look at it from an ecological perspective, because the birds are migrating far north to move into there.",
        "So what has changed, I mean, is it - I guess the other question, which I guess you've to establish, is that some birds now always fly north to England and some birds typically fly south to Spain and they don't mix, in other words.",
        "They go there separate ways when it's time to migrate.",
        "Yes, that is probably the most significant and important result that we have because it shows that reproductive isolation - the barrier to interbreeding freely evolves very quickly within only 50 years.",
        "So that is actually evolution that you can witness in the timeframe.",

        "I understand the general concern, that you would not, if you could avoid it, want to be taken out of Hong Kong's judicial system and moved into China's less transparent system.",
        "But Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the Hong Kong official who has been pushing this legislation, says it is not as bad as portrayed.",

        "Our proposal is based on existing legislation, with the relevant human rights safeguards and procedural safeguards, including the role of the court and a fair and impartial judicial system of Hong Kong being fully maintained.",
        "Is this true, that even if the law were to pass, that if you had a right to be tried in Hong Kong, it's where you'd be tried?",
        "Well, the legislation didn't really give our court a lot of this power.",
        "Unlike, for example, the Canadian court with the lady from Huawei, if there is a similar situation happening in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong court would have to turn the person over to China or another jurisdiction, regardless.",
        "This is an interesting comparison.",
        "You're noting that a Chinese business executive was arrested in Canada on the request of the United States, but the extradition has proven to be a rather intricate and drawn out affair.",
        "You're saying that that would not be the case in Hong Kong were China to...",
        "That would not be the case in Hong Kong because, in the Canadian court, they would have the right under their law to allow the defendant to defend herself, to prove to the Canadian court that the American accusation may not be accurate.",
        "So imagine that this case is happening in Hong Kong, that there's an attempt by the Chinese authorities to extradite an American, he actually - he or she actually would not have those rights that this person is currently enjoying in Canada.",
        "Would this bill pass if it were before the legislature?",
        "Well, it would because, in Hong Kong, we have a strange situation that people like myself from the pro-democracy camp - we are the minority in the legislature because of the design of the system.",
        "We are always in the minority.",
        "So that's why people want universal suffrage, real democracy in Hong Kong.",
        "But we didn't get that.",
        "So a very unpopular law.",
        "As long as the government wants to push it through, they'll get it.",
        "I want to ask one other question, and it's about the long term.",
        "As you know very well, of course, the reason that Hong Kong has different rights and a different judicial system than the rest of China is because that was agreed to as Britain left Hong Kong in 1997.",
        "China agreed to maintain certain rights in Hong Kong for 50 years, until 2047.",
        "Do you think in the long term that Hong Kong is going to be able to maintain its freedoms?",
        "That is actually the biggest concern that we have in Hong Kong among activists and pro-democracy advocates because, for example, in the Basic Law, in the joint declaration between the U.K.",
        "and China, we were promised that we are going to have universal suffrage, real democracy.",
        "But we have waited for 22 years and still nowhere in sight."

        "Is it specific to the human intervention or is it just that something positive happened in the environment and then over 50 years they were able to change enough to take advantage of it?",
        "Yeah.",
