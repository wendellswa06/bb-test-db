        "Hey, thank you.",
        "How are you doing?",
        "Good.",
        "Good.",
        "I got a quick question.",
        "I was just kind of curious.",
        "You know, most of the (unintelligible) suggests that it will actually take millions of years for significant evolutional changes.",
        "And I'm wondering how in your study of, you know, just a few decades and a few generation you can already mark such differences and claim that as, you know, physiological evolution?",
        "Interesting.",
        "I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thanks, Tom, very much.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's a very good question.",
        "It is mainly that the Black Cap has a very large genetic variation for migratory traits.",
        "That means there is a lot of genetic variation in how far the birds go, in which direction they go and because there is so much variation, we have the raw material for selection to act upon this variation and for evolution to be relatively quick.",
        "And when we started the project, I mean, we obviously didn't know that we're going to find that the reproductive isolation will evolve that quickly in that bird species.",
        "However, once it evolved, there is an even higher possibility for adaption and for evolution to occur because all the adaptions towards a specific migratory root such as the one towards the U.K.",
        "will not be lost due to recombination with birds migrating in another direction.",
        "I see.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "No, I was just going to - I was going to ask the question, if you looked at two of the these birds side by side, the ones that typically went to England now, and the ones that went to Spain, do they look different?",
        "No, they still look very much the same.",
        "So what we need to do is we analyze their claw material that is equivalent to our fingernails and we - by analyzing the claw material we can pinpoint in which area they spent the winter.",
        "So wee don't have to envision evolution, in this case, as producing, say, a new species within only 50 years.",
        "No, it's going to take considerably longer than that.",
        "I see.",
        "So it's not as if their beaks are changing shape."

        "Yes.",
        "The beaks are changing their shape and also the wings are changing their shape, but the changes are relatively small, similar as in the examples of the Darwin finches that you alluded to in the beginning.",
        "It's in the range of, say, one to two millimeters.",
        "So we have to measure them very well and accurately to actually pinpoint the differences.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "And - okay, so you're seeing these small physiological changes or small anatomical changes.",
        "Do you see genetic changes between the ones that migrate in one direction versus the ones that migrate in a different direction?",
        "Yes.",
        "We also see these genetic changes and we see them in genetic material that is not (unintelligible) for particular traits.",
        "And this is important because this genetic material is providing the kind of baseline of genetic changes.",
        "So we find the - that they are genetically distinct and we find that they are morphologically distinct, and even though we are only talking about the range of one or two millimeters, this is ecologically important.",
        "Right.",
        "So - but the question, I'm wondering, then is, these non - the changes that you're seeing are not in the genes, but how they're switched on and off, is what I understand these non�regulatory segments are all about - or these non-coding segments are all about.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They are important because they are very polymorphic.",
        "And�",
        "What does that mean, polymorphic?",
        "That there is a lot of variation in these non-coding gene areas and they mutate rather quickly.",
        "So if you are to see changes that you - where you - no, let me put it another way.",
        "Okay.",
        "If you look at reproductive isolation, you will have a buildup of genetic changes if two populations are not freely interbreeding.",
        "And this is what we look at if we look at these non-coding areas because they mutate very frequently.",
        "It's easier to detect changes here.",
        "Right."

        "And so the changes we find between the two populations are still relatively small, but they are significant and they exceed, say, the genetic difference of blackcap populations that are separated by 800 kilometers from southern to northern Germany.",
        "So if this process went on for many more generations, do you think you'd have two different species of blackcap?",
        "Yes, if this same process is continuing, then we would eventually end up with different species because what we are seeing now is this kind of first step in inter-speciation.",
        "However, it depends obviously on a number of assumptions, say, that the English are still feeding the birds for a long time to come and are not kind of put off feeding birds because of an economic crisis or whatsoever.",
        "Well, let me put it slightly different.",
        "I don't think it's a bad thing.",
        "Feeding birds is not a bad thing, and in this particular case, the blackcap is actually benefiting very much from the situation because it found a new migratory area that is not that far away from their breeding grounds in southern Germany and Spain.",
        "However, I do think that we should be better aware of the changes that we are actually producing in the species that surround us.",
        "For example, if we are feeding a lot of chickadees in winter and they survive very well throughout the winter, these birds will occupy nest cavities that other long-distance migrants might need.",
        "And they will be kind of at a disadvantage relative to the competition of more chickadees because fewer of them died over the winter.",
        "I got it.",
        "So you could be having a significant effect on the ecosystem by feeding the birds.",
