        "It's a really dark moment, but it's sort of, you know, in the classic tradition of war films.",
        "Journalist Allison Kaplan Sommer.",
        "But it's really clear, though, that - I think Rochelle mentioned that the writing has been on the wall for some time, and I think one of the things that we run the risk of happening here is that Hillary Clinton runs a risk of ignoring something that she has said before, that it takes, in effect, a village to win the Democratic, not only the Democratic nomination, but ultimately for a Democrat to win the White House.",
        "And the more she carries on talking about this race issue, the more you see that village, sort of, sectioning off into bits and pieces, and I think, at some point in the not to distant future, I think we'll get to the point where Mrs. Clinton is going to have to call it quits.",
        "Because if you look at the numbers, the numbers just don't add up at this point, and I'm not quite sure exactly how she sees a path to the nomination remaining.",
        "From what I've seen, and from what I've read, some people have given her a five-percent chance if that marked.",
        "So I think, in fairly short order, maybe after the next primary in West Virginia, we'll probably see that tent folding.",
        "But I think one of the things that she really needs to be careful about going forward is whether or not she further splinters this Democratic coalition that's needed to win the White House in November.",
        "Rochelle, you're in Michigan.",
        "John's in Florida.",
        "Senator Clinton doesn't want to give up the primary results from these states.",
        "Now, in Michigan, she was the only candidate among the two remaining on the ticket at all.",
        "So the DNC says these delegates will be seated somehow, but what do you think, first of all, how are people feeling in Michigan?",
        "And what do you think is going to happen on that score?",
        "Well, there are some folks who are wondering why Hillary Clinton was not upset when DNC first decided to disenfranchise voters back in January, back in December, when they said when you hold this primary, you won't seat your delegates.",
        "So all of sudden, this seemed to be a surprise when they actually did it, and of course, now they're not going to, and they've come up with a proposal that they think is fair.",
        "But the bigger issue is that she looks very hypocritical, and that this was all fine back in January.",
        "And as long as nobody was getting delegates, there was no big discussion about disenfranchised voters.",
        "But now that she needs them, all of a sudden they've become important, and there is something else.",
        "If she isn't careful, she is going to alienate, or she has already alienated some of the people that she's been counting on.",
        "Whether she's talking about hard-working Americans who shouldn't be disenfranchised, or hard-working white Americans, who somehow, she seems to be a little more important for a little bit than hard-working Americans, who quite frankly, have succeeded economically, and some of these folks she's talking about aspired to those same things.",
        "If you're going to appeal only to the poor, and paint your candidate, your opponent, as elitist, then what are you doing with folks who have raised themselves up, and tried to do better?",
        "I think that she's forgetting her woman base in focusing just on those blue-collar, hardworking folks, particularly the guys that she's chugging beers with in bars.",
        "One of the things that's clear is that she's got about 60 percent of white votes in some of these primaries, but that means that Barack Obama has got 40 percent, which is unprecedented historically.",
        "So she's making a lot of arguments that don't make sense, and the superdelegates now have to pay attention, but as for Michigan..."

        "You're actually asking for aid, but then you're also specifying how it needs to be administered.",
        "And I know there's a lot of concern about whether the government would, or the military would actually take these supplies and not administer it to the victims.",
        "But I think what's echoing here in Atlanta is this thing is very reminiscent of Hurricane Katrina, and there's a lot of Hurricane Katrina victims here.",
