        "The cutest little thing was found on the ocean floor this week - a little googly-eyed purple squid off the coast of California.",
        "It looks like a close friend of Nemo.",

        "We're not quite sure on the he or she of this squid.",
        "But we do know it is a stubby squid, or a North Pacific Bobtail Squid, scientific name Rossia pacifica.",
        "This animal looks like a cross between an octopus and squid but tends to be more related to the cuttlefish.",
        "As you can tell, it spends a lot of life on the sea floor.",
        "We encountered it sort of perched on the sediment with that now-famous googly-eyed expression.",
        "All purple and just has the most adorable little endearing eyes.",
        "Yes.",
        "We probably encountered this squid at a time it wasn't expecting to see a 5,500-pound underwater robot moving towards it.",
        "So he was just surprised?",
        "Right.",
        "Scuba divers actually encounter these squid at scuba diving depths, and they say that when, you know, their dive lights turn on them they get this similar kind of deer-in-the-headlights look.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They're actually nocturnal hunters, so they spend a lot of their day actually burrowed in the sea floor with just their eyes poking out.",
        "And then when they feel comfortable, when it's time to hunt, they'll come out and actually start creeping along, looking for their next meal.",
        "So I think we encountered a squid on the hunt that wasn't expecting to see us.",
        "But yes, this one is bright purple, which was pretty exciting for us to see.",
        "Definitely stood out against the mud of the canyon we were in."

        "And he or she eats what?",
        "So these are squid that kind of hang out around the sea floor.",
        "They spend their day burrowed in the settlement with just their eyes poking out, so that's kind of their best form of camouflage.",
        "But they also have the ability to activate a little sticky mucus jacket.",
        "And once they've activated that little jacket, sediment - so pebbles, sand, whatever they're sort of burrowing in - will stick to that jacket and give it a nice extra layer of camouflage.",
        "So they lie in wait - they're ambush predators - and as soon as a small fish or a shrimp crawls by it, it'll actually sort of turn off that mucus jacket and slide out of the sediment to lunge for their next meal.",
        "Cute, but don't underestimate them.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Very cute, but definitely ambush predators you don't want to encounter if you're a shrimp.",
        "You're now docked in San Francisco, and I think that's pretty close to Pixar.",
        "I mean, any agents from that studio on board?",

        "Is this a real animal?",
        "How do we know it's real?",
        "So I think it definitely captured the imagination of both our researchers on board and our hundreds of viewers who were watching as we discovered this guy.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, one sided in the sense that they're both factions of the conservative trend in politics in Iran.",
        "But it's two power centers, the two primary constitutional power centers that the Islamic Republic of Iran has had since it came into being in 1979.",
        "And usually, the supreme leader and the president work well together.",
        "They have over the years.",
        "But it's gotten particularly difficult now.",
        "And I think this is actually very interesting that this happened within the last year and really intensifying now because this is the period after the disputed presidential election in 2009 when the supreme leader supported Ahmadinejad.",
        "And then, Ahmadinejad repaid him later by basically trying to take some of his power away, and more and more overtly, the supreme leader is trying to hem in and constrain Ahmadinejad.",
        "And this – there are also two camps on the conservative side, and they get at one another through surrogates as well.",
        "Interesting.",
        "I think it broke into the open when President Ahmadinejad tried to fire his intelligence chief, and that person was then reinstalled by the supreme leader.",
        "And Ahmadinejad fired him more than once.",
        "This was earlier this year.",
        "There was a lot of suspicion that this was an intelligence minister who had a lot of dirt on both characters, but it became a real struggle.",
        "And Ahmadinejad lost that one, and then he went into a sulk.",
        "And for 10 days, he didn't go to work.",
        "He didn't hold Cabinet meetings.",
        "This was well reported on in the press in Iran and ultimately didn't do him much good that he's seemed like a sulker.",
        "But this is all part of the fascinating story of this power struggle.",
        "It's been emerging step by step this year.",
        "Now, dozens of people, allies of President Ahmadinejad, have been arrested in a banking scandal.",
        "This plays into the attempt to impeach the finance minister.",
        "This just became known a couple weeks ago.",
        "It is believed that some bankers essentially embezzled $2.6 billion, Neal, from some of the major banks in Iran simply by writing false letters of credit.",
        "And this suggests that there was a fairly large conspiracy of bankers that allowed a few to bilk the treasury of Iran.",
        "And as a result, the parliament called the minister of the economy before it yesterday, and they tried to impeach him.",
        "He's Ahmadinejad's man, and they tried to remove him from office.",
        "They almost did but didn't.",

        "and the United States haven't had any impact on life in Iran.",
        "But Ahmadinejad contradicted that yesterday and said in fact that the current set of sanctions, which have become harsher and harsher, have made it impossible for Iranian banks to carry out certain transactions, international transactions.",
        "And this was an indication that in fact these sanctions are doing what they have been - they were conceived to do.",
        "In the end, he was bailed out by one of his opponents, Ali Larijani.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, it seemed that there weren't enough votes to move toward a formal interrogation of the president, which has never taken place in the history of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and that could have led to impeachment.",

        "There had been threats by the parliament to impeach him before.",
