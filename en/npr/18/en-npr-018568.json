        "The Iranians also say their nuclear program has been hindered to some degree by an assassination program, scientists murdered, it says, by Israel.",
        "Well, yes.",

        "They may or may not all have been part of the nuclear program, but it certainly has rattled the Iranian authorities and the Iranian intelligence world.",
        "They have not been able to fully explain this.",
        "The normal reaction is to blame Israel for doing this.",
        "There are some suspicions that at least one of these characters was - may have been murdered by Iranian intelligence themselves because, although a nuclear engineer, it's been said, it's also been asserted that he was supportive of the opposition movement in Iran.",
        "And maybe the Iranians themselves decided to take him out.",

        "It's an extraordinary story, and it generated - this is - it's very interesting.",
        "It generated enormous skepticism on the part of the Iran analyst community, internationally and in the United States.",
        "Most did not believe that this was possible, that something as bizarre, irresponsible and incomprehensible would actually happen.",
        "How would this benefit Iran, many people questioned.",
        "I think all the questions about this alleged plot are very interesting.",
        "But one thing that, I think, people have failed to do is ask, why would Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador be the target?",
        "And this is what's interesting to me.",
        "In the WikiLeak documents, in the document that cabled from the U.S.",

        "charge d'affaires and Ambassador al-Jubeir in which he essentially tells the Americans that the king of Saudi Arabia would like to see the United States attack Iran and cut off the head of the snake.",
        "Those are the actually words that Adel al-Jubeir used.",
        "And at least, that, it seems to me, is one bit of evidence that might suggests why al-Jubeir was - may have been a target for something that could have been a real conspiracy.",
        "Not a member of the royal family, but a very close advisor to the king.",
        "The king, exactly.",
        "And a very influential figure.",
        "Obviously, as ambassador to the United States, they are not small figures.",
        "But as you look at this, a lot of people also say it doesn't make any sense.",

        "If they're capable of an irrational act like an attempt to blow up the Saudi ambassador in a Washington, D.C., restaurant, everything is on the table.",
        "I think that that's one line of thought that is logical and makes sense.",
        "But the biggest illogical elements to all this, for me, is that Iran would - if the United States had to respond militarily and war broke out between Iran and the United States, it would certainly hurt Iran deeply.",
        "It - no one believes that in war with the United States, Iran would come out the winner.",
        "So it's puzzling why they would conceive of such a plan and bring war down on their heads when that's not really in their interest.",
        "That's a real puzzle part - part of a puzzle here."

        "The first African American would probably be Phillis Wheatley and her book of poems that was published at England, but with a lot of sponsorship from the United States.",
        "That is the best-known writer in terms of print.",
        "Of course, well, that is complicated by the fact that we really ought to talk about the origins of African-American literature in oration, in the oral tradition, which is simultaneous with the print tradition in this country.",
        "So you have Phillis Wheatley as a beginning and, of course, other poets who followed her.",
        "And at the beginning of the 19th century, you have a lot of writing in terms of legal matters and certainly something as famous as David Walker's 1829 \"\"Appeal to the Citizens of the World.\"\" And, of course, they - at this time, we also have the rise of the slave narratives, as we used to call them, the narratives of the enslaved either written by those slaves who had some literacy or stories as told to.",
        "So we begin then our tradition of writing of literature with what I call literature of necessity, always trying to prove something.",
        "And the latest stages of the origins, people are not trying to prove something so much as to be effective in terms of using the means that was within the culture at that time to get attention and draw attention to wrongs or to matters that needed to be taken cared of.",
        "Ted, what other kind of themes did we see develop during this time and, I guess, a little bit later?",
        "Well, I think one of the things that, to add to the very good points that Jerry has made, is it's a literature whose - one of whose primary goals is to establish that the writer actually has a self, has a person, has a mind, has feelings, is, in effect, human.",
        "So literacy becomes a way, not only of achieving particular political ends, let's say anti-slavery agitation or post Civil War, agitation for greater degrees of freedom, but it has another aim and that is to say that, you know, I, as a writer, am just as much a human as anyone else, anyone else who has written, anyone else who is reading this.",
        "And literacy then plays a very powerful role in establishing the personhood of the writer.",
