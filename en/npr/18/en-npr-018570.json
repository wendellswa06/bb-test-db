        "We - I would say that, in the opening decades of the 20th century, we have a shift that begins prior to the so-called Harlem Renaissance, especially in the work of James Weldon Johnson, who draws attention to the need to address a broader audience and to the matter of craft, particularly in his preface to \"\"The Book of American Negro Poetry,\"\" 1922.",
        "Then, with the Harlem Renaissance, obviously, people are participating in modernism or some form of it and are trying to appeal both to blacks, to whites, to other people throughout the world.",
        "It becomes more a matter of wanting to be internationally known, to participate in the rich, artistic activities of the time.",
        "And, gentlemen, for you, today, as writers, do you come up against that feeling of, who is my audience?",
        "And how do you deal with that?",
        "Jerry?",
        "Okay.",
        "How I deal with it?",
        "I've unreconstructed.",
        "That means that I still believe in the illusion of a black community and that's a primary audience for which I write.",
        "I recognize, of course, that it doesn't exist.",
        "I'm not writing to air.",
        "I'm writing actually for anyone who wants to read me.",
        "I think I would agree.",
        "I mean, there is an - I think of it as sort of in terms of multiple audiences.",
        "There are audiences of - in the black community, black academics, other people interested in African, African-American literature, and people in general, who are interested to picking -interested, rather, in picking up whatever it is I happen to write.",
        "One of the problems, and this is, I suppose, part of the nature of the beast when you are writing is that once you put it out there, you cannot control who's reading it and who's not reading it.",
        "And there are lots of audiences.",
        "I mean, I - when I'm writing some of my critical material, I think about people like Jerry Ward reading it.",
        "And so, moving forward, what trends are you seeing in black literature as we get to our last few minutes here?",
        "I think one of the interesting ones...",

        "Okay, one of the interesting things, I think, is the elaboration of different genres, different black writers moving into genres even into romance fiction.",
        "And I'm not trying to either advocate or criticize the romance fiction, but I'm thinking of the ability to sort of penetrate multiple markets to create sort of niches for the multiple audiences that are out there.",
        "There's not one black audience.",
        "If one listens to various kinds of - for lack of a better term -black radio, we discover that there are multiple audiences out there.",
        "Not only do they shift according to the time period, as I mentioned earlier, but inside of specific time periods, you have multiple audiences.",
        "I think this elaboration is one of the most fascinating things for me.",
        "I quite agree.",
        "I think it's also becoming, for scholars, quite a problem because you have to deal with the spoken word.",
        "And the fact that much of the literature now is on CD or it's actually performed, and you're dealing with matters of performance.",
        "You have to deal with these genres, as Ted had said.",
        "And I think the genre of romance has entered into the realm of the erotic and is going a little beyond the erotic into soft-core pornography from some of the things that I sample at - on bookshelves in Borders and other places.",
        "And, of course, there is a strand of literature that deals with Christianity that people are not talking about.",
        "I have read several novels that are not well advertised where morality, Christianity is very important.",
        "So we're getting a rich banquet of work coming from our writers now.",
        "And in an interesting way, that last note you mentioned, Jerry, is in - to some degree, maybe you would - let us know if you agree or disagree with this - but to some degree it sort of returns to a kind of moral ground of the late 19th and early 20th centuries where Christian theology became a kind of bedrock.",
        "And even earlier, I suppose, into the mid-19th century, becomes the bedrock for political action, particularly as represented in, not only in slave narratives but essays, and the fiction of - of the post-bellum period.",

        "But the price of gold and particularly this huge rise that we've been seeing for years and years now, is not driven by those industrial uses.",
        "The pretty factor, I think that actually factors into the sort of early history of gold, right.",
        "Before money was ever invented, I think people liked gold because it was pretty, and it was easy to work with, and it was relatively easy to find and to melt down in the pre-industrial world.",
        "So I feel like the prettiness sort of helped to give gold its launch thousands of years ago.",
        "But now, you know, it's just gold because it's gold.",
        "It's just another precious metal, but it is the precious metal.",
        "It really is.",
        "I mean, there is nothing else - you know, people talk about silver, and silver did have this big run-up in price, but silver also I think has much more significant industrial uses.",

        "Does it always track that in hard times, gold is the last port in a storm?",
        "It certainly seems to track fear, and I'm not speaking quantitatively here.",
        "But qualitatively, it's very clear that when people are really afraid about the world, about governments, about the value of money, about everything, if you're afraid the world is going to start to fall apart, that is the time when people like to buy gold.",
