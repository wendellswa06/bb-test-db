        "And he sort of eliminated almost everything and got down to gold and said, you know, partly for the reason the caller is saying, the fact that it's not reactive, it won't tarnish, it won't rust, you can throw it in the ocean.",

        "Well, at this level, unless it's extremely rare or in extremely great condition, it's - yeah, it's basically just its fundamental base metal value.",
        "Okay, now, you had a question.",
        "Well, here's what I don't understand, why I never hear, with all this talk about all the problems with the economy today, as soon as we went off the gold standard, and the governments were allowed to print money with the Federal Reserve, that's when this problem started, at zero dollars national debt.",
        "Now we're at $14 trillion, but nobody seems to mention that since 1933, we went from zero to $14 trillion because we stopped backing our money with real, tangible metal.",

        "So the national debt was not at zero in 1933.",
        "I don't have those figures in front of me, but I'm pretty sure the only time the national debt ever got to zero was when Andrew Jackson was president in the 19th century.",
        "I mean, we talked to a number of economists about the gold standard when we did our piece, and to a remarkable degree, you know, economists don't agree on anything, but to a remarkable agree, they seem to agree that the gold standard was a bad idea.",
        "And the Depression is the key thing they cite.",
        "And if you look back at the Depression, first England went off the gold standard, I believe in 1931, and then we went off in '33, and a number of other countries went off.",
        "And there is this very high connection between when a country goes off the gold standard and when it begins to recover from the Depression.",
        "And that's basically because the world was in this deflationary spiral at the time."

        "And the essentially solution to that was basically, as scary as it sounds today, to print more money.",
        "When you're on gold, indeed you cannot print more money, and there is something that sounds sort of comforting about that.",
        "But there is a very strong economic consensus that says there are times when in fact you need to print money, and if you're on the gold standard in the middle of the Depression, you're going to be locked in this cycle that you can't get out of.",
