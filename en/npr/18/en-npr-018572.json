        "The Fed told us that the economy was weakening more than they had anticipated in their last meeting and that their inflation outlook is falling, as well.",
        "And essentially what we're seeing as a result of that is the Federal Reserve offering what I think is tepid support.",
        "And in this case, what they've done is extend the language on their statement a little bit to include basically saying that rates of - interest rates will remain low for, you know, at least through mid-2013, so quite a very specific timeline on that, that timing.",
        "So wasn't that what people were expecting, indeed hoping, the Fed would say, interest rates will remain low for a long period of time?",
        "Well, I think what people were really hoping for was that they would come in with more stimulus.",
        "I think this is one of the tools that they could have used is indeed to basically commit to a longer period of interest rate stability.",
        "But I think that most people have already started anticipating that in fact the Fed would be on hold for an extended period due to the weakening of economic conditions.",
        "I think what people truly wanted to see was a more aggressive policy approach, and that would be I think expanding the quantitative easing program.",
        "The Fed did issue a statement that begins with all of that bad news that you remembered - that you mentioned: economic growth considerably slower than the committee expected, recent labor indicators weaker than anticipated.",
        "It does go on to say: However, business investment in equipment and software continues to expand.",
        "Temporary factors, including the dampening effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer purchasing and spending, as well as supply-chain disruptions associated with the tragic events in Japan appear to count for only some of the recent weakness.",
        "Inflation picked up earlier in the year, but that seems to be more under control, inflation moderated as prices of energy and some commodities declined.",
        "That's kind of bad news, good news.",
        "It is bad news, good news, in the sense that yes, inflation - some of those price pressures that were in the system earlier in the year are coming off.",
        "But the sort of bad news part of that is that those price pressures were inducing the Federal Reserve to move to a much more hawkish stance than they really - really was justified, I think, given the data.",
        "And so now what we're seeing is reality set in that they were, I think, much too optimistic on the state of the economy early on, and at the same time, they were much too pessimistic about the inflation outlook.",
        "Now what we're seeing is a reversal of that stance.",
        "And in some sense, you kind of would prefer the other to be true, right.",
        "In some sense, you would actually have preferred that growth was actually stronger and inflation was something of a concern if only because that would suggest the economy was strengthening through the first half and into the second half.",
        "And what we're getting is a very opposite situation.",
        "Well, I actually think that the Spurs are the team to beat in the West simply because a team that's won four titles and are the defending champions, I never bet against them."

        "And some people looked at the economic indicators yesterday in terms of what the markets were doing and how they were placing their bets in terms of, well, the price of oil going down as people anticipated a global economic slowdown.",
        "People said - investors in any case seemed to be anticipating another set of bad news, another recession maybe.",

        "And you see that.",
        "I think where you really see that show up is not only our stocks dropping, but you've seen this rush into treasuries.",

        "treasuries as an unsafe asset at this point.",
        "They're rushing into them as fast as they can.",
        "And you're seeing really some - I think some evidence there of very weak growth expectations for a very long period of time.",
        "So whatever's going to happen, it's going to take a while.",
        "It's - well, it's certainly going to take a while if market participants and agents throughout the economy continue to believe that the fiscal and monetary authorities, basically the Federal Reserve and the federal government, are basically out of the game, that they are not willing to boost stimulus efforts going forward.",
        "And that's where I think a lot of this challenge lies is that if you look at the - what happened over the past month with the budget debate, it's all really focused on fiscal consolidation, fiscal contraction while we're in an economy that has over nine percent unemployment and very weak economic growth in the first half of the year and concerns about weak economic growth in the second half of this year.",
        "So, all of these concerns about fiscal consolidation, fiscal austerity, are really tightening the noose, more so, on the U.S.",

        "Well, the markets, after dipping well below zero for a while, have gone back into positive territory.",
        "It's up about 75 points at last glance.",
        "So we're going to have to see how that plays out.",
        "Obviously, volatility is the key word for the past several days on the market.",
        "Right, right.",
        "You saw also on the upside of - or after several days of such tremendous downward pressure, I think that anything, any sort of news, positive news in any event, might be something of a relief and at least stop some of that downward draft temporarily.",

        "And clearly there is a lot of cash business going on there, right.",
        "It's just these little shops, and people are walking in with wads of $100 bills or little sacks of coins.",
        "So there is certainly a lot of, you know, a lot of cash business going on there, and I would be shocked if those people were reporting every transaction they were doing to the IRS.",
        "And, you know, I think more broadly that is consistent with this idea that people who like gold see that gold is sort of outside the system, right?",
        "If you don't trust the government, if you don't trust money that is backed by the government, then oftentimes you buy gold.",
        "So I mean, it sort of fits together.",
        "At the same time, you know, there has been the rise of these investment vehicles, exchange-traded funds, ETFs, that are much more mainstream.",
        "And on the one hand, you know, you have to report it to the IRS and everything, but basically, as easily as you can buy a stock out of an online brokerage account, you can buy one of these ETFs that then in turn buys gold.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "...flee the country, but it's a very cheap way to invest in gold.",
        "So that has brought a lot of more mainstream sort of, you know, retail investors into gold, I think.",

        "And I mean, I do think it's the - so we bought this little quarter ounce coin, which is a terrible investment idea because, you know, a quarter ounce coin is kind of an unusual item, so you end up paying a higher premium and actually because it was very low value we even had to pay sales tax, which it's like who's ever heard of having to pay sales tax on an investment.",
        "And then, we had to pay another fee when we sold it.",
        "So, you know, I mean, it's sort of exceptional, and it's because we were doing it for this project, but it does also speak to the fact that certainly before there were these ETFs there were high transactional costs associated with getting in and out of gold.",

        "As their middle class begins to have some real disposable income, there's going to be a suck on the supply of gold like we've never seen before, and that will probably sustain the price where it's at right now.",
        "But, frankly, outside of that, this price is completely artificial.",
        "It could drop.",
        "Within two months, it could be back down to 400 bucks.",
        "I don't believe in the price of gold at all, and I trade in it and make a living in it.",
        "And you say China and India because culturally those societies value gold?",
        "Exactly.",
        "Those cultures value gold as jewelry, as ornamentation, and they usually buy 24-karat gold jewelry, which has, you know, for jewelry is, you know, would - again, they've got in China 1.4 billion people.",
        "If they have a strong middle class someday in the 800-million range that actually has real disposable income, I think that just the gold being used in jewelry will affect the supply and demand ratios, and we can see these type of prices sustained because right now every bit of gold that came out of the ground is with us.",
        "It doesn't get burned like oil.",
        "Even platinum, you know, is used in industry in a much more significant way than gold, so that's the only fundamental that works for me is the actual demand for jewelry in those countries.",
