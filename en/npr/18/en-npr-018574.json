        "Mr.",
        "PAUL FUCHS Co-director, Center for Sensory Biology, Johns Hopkins University): Hi, thanks a lot for having me on the show.",
        "Well, you're welcome.",
        "So I think - oh, and we'd like to ask listeners, as well, to come along and talk about this, if you can hear us out there, 800-989-8255.",
        "And I think the first thing we should talk about is that - how does - and then we have to a little primer about how sound gets into the air and then gets to the brain and how the brain makes sense of that.",
        "That, you know, that should only take a few minutes, 200 years of research.",
        "Thirty seconds, I'm sure, is more than enough.",
        "Okay, so here we go.",
        "The sound waves in the air set the eardrum into motion.",
        "That's a pretty familiar topic to any of us.",
        "And that's coupled into the inner ear through the middle-ear ossicles.",
        "So there's three little bones in the middle ear that couple the movements of the eardrum into the fluids that fill the inner ear itself, which is called the cochlea.",
        "So now you've got sound waves in the air that have become fluid motions in the inner ear.",
        "And that then, in turn, sets into motion little mechano-sensory cells called hair cells because they have a little bundle of microvilli that look like hairs.",
        "When those hairs get bent by the fluid motion, that changes the electrical properties of that cell.",
        "So that's transduction.",
        "That means it's converted sound waves, mechanical energy, into an electrical signal in this little neuro-epithelial cell called a hair cell.",
        "So that's the first step.",
        "Now that's good because the brain works with bioelectricity.",
        "So we've got a little electrical signal in the hair cell, but the hair cell's a tiny little cell.",
        "It's only maybe 10 microns, 10 millionths of a meter in length, and it doesn't reach to the brain itself.",
        "Instead, it communicates with a nerve cell that has a long axon and carries information to the brain.",
        "And the sensory hair cell communicates to that nerve cell by releasing an excitatory neurochemical called glutamate.",
        "So once the hair cell's membrane potential, once its electrical signal is generated, then it releases this glutamate, which excites the afferent neuron, the neuron that goes to the brain, and that carries the actual signal to the central nervous system.",
        "Right.",
        "Okay, now just because I've been writing furiously, I'm going to go over that one more time to make sure I've got it.",
        "Okay.",
        "Sound waves come in the outer ear.",
        "They make the outer eardrum vibrate.",
        "That gets transmitted through the middle ear to these three small bones into the inner ear, where it sets up waves of this fluid that's in the inner ear.",
        "And inside the inner ear, there are these little hair cells, and as these hairs, you know, these hairs start washing around in this wave motion that's been set up by the sound, they change the potential, the electrical potential of the cell, and that, in turn, allows an electrical signal to be sent along the nerves into the brain.",
        "Yeah, simple, isn't it?"

        "Yeah, yeah.",

        "That was excellent.",
        "You get a B+ for that.",
        "All right, yeah.",
        "Well, okay.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So that's - but that's been known, right?",
        "I mean, this piece of neurophysiology or sensory physiology has been in textbooks for hundreds, if not - well, many hundreds of years.",
        "That's right, so and the basic electrophysiology, the measurements and the recordings which have established that pathway, really started in the 1940s.",
        "The first reports of recordings from these nerve fibers, which carry information to the brain, were published by Galambos and Davis.",
        "Right.",
        "So now, the thing is is that that's the kind of main pathway, and 95 percent of what happens, happens exactly like that, where there's one population of afferent neurons, these nerve cells that carry information to the brain, 95 percent of them are these large-diameter, so-called type one afferent neurons.",
        "And they report the brain everything that we know about sound -timing, intensity and frequency content.",
        "And that's what we've been able to learn about because they make up most of the nerve.",
        "And the studies were always done by taking a fine microelectrode to collect signals from individual nerve fibers and ask how they respond to sound.",
        "So that's been the main story.",
        "The last remaining bit, though, was that there's a few neurons, those remaining five percent, which are much smaller.",
        "They have a different kind of arborization or innervation pattern in the cochlea, and we just couldn't find them.",
        "This process of sticking an electrode into the nerve, you just never found these little guys, so…",
        "So you can see them under the microscope, but you can't poke them with a recorder."

        "That's right.",
        "You could visualize them in various sorts of histological methods, and you knew they were there.",
        "In fact, from the turn of the 20th century, from the 19th to the 20th century, people first began to say look, there's these other interesting neurons there that had this very different arborization pattern, different branching pattern.",
        "What do they do?",
        "Ah, don't tell us yet.",
        "Don't tell us yet.",
        "I won't.",

        "We're talking with Paul Fuchs.",
        "He's the co-director of the Center for Sensory Biology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and we're taking your calls.",
        "The number is 800-989-8255, and when we left our hero, Paul Fuchs, we were just about to hear what these five percent of neurons which were too small to see in the past - now we've found a way to visualize them or listen to them or record from them and find out what the heck they're doing.",
        "Right, and you know, the situation was so frustrating for a long time that people - some people even suggested that these weren't afferent neurons.",
        "Maybe they didn't signal to the brain at all.",
        "Maybe they just had something to do with activity within the cochlea itself."

        "But once the student who did this project, Catherine Weiss(ph), who goes by Cat(ph), began to work on this, she was able to develop a way to record from these very rare and mysterious type two neurons and determine that they, in fact, are afferents, that is that they are excited by glutamate release from hair cells just like the predominate type one neurons, and they're excitable.",
        "They generate the electrical signals that can propagate to the brain.",
        "So they definitely are afferent neurons.",
        "So they're going toward the brain.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But it's interesting.",
        "It's an interesting idea that the brain is not only receiving signals from the ear, you think of that as a sort of an input device, but the brain is sending instructions to the ear, as well.",
        "Yes, that's correct.",
        "So that's something else that we work on in our group, and we are trying to understand what those feedback signals from the brain are all about.",
        "In fact, nicely, these two things tie together because these type two afferent neurons that Cat has recorded from are contacting the hair cells, which are the target of this feedback pathway from the brain.",
        "So it's almost like there might be a kind of a loop here, where the type two neurons may be specialized in some way to report on what these hair cells are doing that at the same time are being controlled by the brain.",
        "Okay, well, I think this is a good time to open the phones up to some of our listeners, and so let's take a call now.",
        "Let's first go to Bill(ph), in - is it Neda, Wisconsin?",

        "Okay, thanks.",
        "You mean tinnitus, I think.",
        "Tinnitus, noise in the ear.",
        "Right, okay.",
        "It depends on which side of the Atlantic you're on if it's tinnitus or tinnitus, to bring up on the country.",
        "But in any event, yeah, that's a really major issue of interest and clinical concern.",
        "Many people suffer from tinnitus.",
        "It can be profoundly disturbing in some cases.",
        "It's often associated with some degree of hearing loss.",
        "Now, whether the present work helps us learn something about it is an interesting possibility.",
        "One of the ideas that people have floated is that tinnitus arises because there's been an imbalance in the kind of information coming to the brain because of some hearing loss in the periphery.",
        "And so maybe it has to do with the relative contributions of, say, type one and type two afferent neurons, which is why in part we're so excited about being able to work on these type two neurons.",
        "Specifically, because now, what we can do is define some molecular characteristics of those neurons and then be in the position to begin to think about how we might selectively alter their activity to test these kinds of ideas.",
        "I suppose we should close the loop here a little bit.",
        "We talked at the opening of the show about these - helping to explain how painful sounds are recognized, and we haven't really said how that works.",
        "That's correct.",
        "So that was another one of the really, I think, exciting findings that Cat made, which is that these afferent neurons that she recorded from, these rare ones, are surprisingly insensitive.",
        "So if one delivers an equivalent kind of stimulus to the inner ear, the major type one neurons are very, very sensitive and respond very actively, but the type two neurons get only very weak input.",
        "So that if we translate this into thinking about sound, it suggests that these type two neurons would have to be exposed to very loud sound to be activated and send a signal to the brain.",
        "So it might be that the two classes of neurons really divide up the auditory world into normal sound for the type one neurons and then very loud sound for the type two neurons.",
        "And that very loud sound is what, in some cases, is objectionable or painful to some people.",
        "Interesting.",
        "Okay, let's take another call now and go to Tony(ph) in Golden, Colorado.",
