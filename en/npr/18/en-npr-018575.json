        "Sure.",
        "I'm a medical student, and we just took anatomy, and we postponed studying the vestibulocochlear nerve, the nerve for hearing.",
        "But I was curious about what nerve innervates those pain fibers, and could you also talk about the tensor tympani muscle controlling loud sounds?",
        "Ooh, that's another one I pronounce differently.",
        "I always called it the tensor tympani.",
        "How about that?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Thanks, Tony, for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Great, yeah.",
        "So these type two afferent neurons are in the same nerve, the eighth nerve, as the type one afferent neurons.",
        "So it's the same nerve route.",
        "So anatomically, in fact, they project to most of the same places in the central nervous system.",
        "So in that sense, they're anatomically in parallel.",
        "Then you also ask about the tensor tympani.",
        "This is part of the acoustic reflex.",
        "This is actually innervated by motor neurons, which are activated by loud sounds.",
        "So one of our protective mechanisms is to clamp down the tensor, the eardrum a little bit by the tensor tympani that reduces its motion and so cuts down on the energy being transmitted into the inner ear, as does another muscles called the stapedius muscle, which connects up to one of the middle-ear ossicles and restricts its range of motion when it's contracting.",
        "So we have a lot of ways in which we can protect the ear from damage, and that's one of them.",
        "If we're going to talk about the tensor tympani, we'd be long to leave out the stapedius, don't you think?",

        "Jason, you're on the air at SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "(Singing) ...and begin to blow it.",
        "First, the question is regarding - you mentioned that glutamate specifically is an important neurotransmitter from all the ear mechanisms to the brain.",
        "My question is whether glutamate as a dietary supplement can be helpful in any aspect of helping hearing.",
        "My comment is regarding tinnitus, that I found since I had had trouble with that as a musician, that it seems my ears are sensitive not only to volume but to clarity of the signal.",
        "For example, digitally recorded or remastered music, I have less trouble with that than older, analog sources or home recordings that have more noise.",
        "So that's an observation, but if you could address my question, I'd be really happy.",
        "Jason, thanks very much for that.",
        "Can I address the observation, too?",
        "Yeah, sure, go ahead.",
        "Oh sure.",
        "Thanks.",
        "No, that's an interesting point about the fact that you find different, you know, sort of more complex and more noisy sound more difficult to deal with, and that's a very common feature of some - whenever there's some hearing loss.",
        "And so as I mentioned, tinnitus often occurs in conjunction with some degree of hearing loss.",
        "And one of the consequences is it's much more difficult to sort out signals from noise, and so that would be consistent with your observation."

        "And then with respect to the question about the dietary glutamate, probably no connection whatsoever.",
        "I think it's very doubtful that dietary glutamate is going to be involved in regulating the degree to which any nerve cell, but in particular the ear, would use it as a neurochemical.",
        "You know, I think this question of pain in the ear is an interesting one, sensing pain.",
        "I know sometimes when I dump the recycling into the can in the garage, it's a very loud sound, and it really makes me wince.",
        "What is the pain coming from?",
        "Where - is it the pain that my hair fibers are saying ah, you know, stop, it's like being in a tsunami here, or is it something else?",
        "Well, I think this is one of the great, unanswered mysteries.",
        "And one of the reasons we actually started this project was because we have colleagues here in the Center for Sensory Biology who study pain explicitly, though in the skin, the somatosensory part of pain, and they made some observations that kind of inspired us to look into the ear to ask if there were some parallels.",
        "Now, I can't say that we've actually proven that to be the case yet, but it's certainly intriguing that these type two afferents that Cat has now recorded from not only serve as detectors of loud sound, but they're also sensitive to a chemical called ATP, adenosine triphosphate, which is itself a mediator of painful stimulation in the skin.",
        "So maybe, you know, maybe we're on the road here to being able to say something about why it is that loud sounds can be painful.",
        "That's very interesting.",

        "That is ultra sensitive hearing.",

        "So he wasn't able to stay for the concert, had to go away from what would have - perhaps otherwise had been enjoyable experience.",
        "And for some people, it can be really acute, walking down the city street can be quite difficult to do.",
        "And so, again, this is clearly some pathological condition of the ear.",
        "But there must also, as well, be underlying genetic differences amongst people which confer, you know, greater sensitivity to - in hearing or greater possibilities of pathologies that then lead to the condition of hyperacusis.",

        "There are certain sounds I simply cannot hear and other sounds I hear perfectly.",
        "And it affects my ability to enjoy a movie or to enjoy a conversation.",
        "And I'm just wondering if there's anything on the horizon that can deal with that problem.",
        "Through traditional hearing aids, hearing would not be very pleasant because they would amplify the sounds I already hear quite well.",
        "Right.",
        "Okay.",
        "You know the answer.",
        "Yes.",
        "Thanks, Mary.",
        "So you pointed out one of the causes of the hearing loss in our populations is due to chemotherapies.",
        "And other is that some of forms of antibiotics are also ototoxic.",
        "They poison the ear, and what they're poisoning are the sensory hair cells.",
        "These are very energetically active and demanding cells which are easily damaged.",
        "And so, some kinds of drugs do that.",
        "And once damaged, then - if they're damaged severely enough, they die off.",
        "And, unfortunately, our sensory hair cells don't regrow - our being mammals - so we don't have the capacity to regenerate these hair cells.",
        "And so we'd lost that region of the cochlea's sensitivity forever.",
        "Now, that typically tends to be the higher frequencies because those hair cells are more sensitive.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I don't hear little children well, and I have to stop my teaching career.",
        "Well, then there are tuneable hearing aids.",
        "I mean, they are now at the point where hearing aids can be adjusted to the particular form of hearing loss that the individual has.",
        "Of course, you're talking about a more expensive instrument, but there are continuing advances in the prosthetics here, the ability to design a hearing aid which has specific kinds of amplification for specific kinds of hearing loss."

        "It's something that many laboratories are working on with a great deal of vigor and effort.",
        "It's a particularly challenging problem for the ear because the anatomy of the ear is so complex and so elegant.",
        "And one of the things that has stymied people is that the inner ear of the - of we, mammals, doesn't regenerate hair cells after damaged, whereas other kinds of tissues do.",
        "And the inner ears of other vertebrates do, so birds and reptiles and amphibia can grow their hair cells perfectly happily after damage.",
        "So the question is what's going on in the inner ear?",
        "Why does it not regenerate itself?",
        "Are there no stem cells there?",
        "Or if we put stem cells in, will they just simply fail to propagate?",
        "And even if they did propagate, will they build the right structure?",
        "So the whole functioning of the ear is essentially dependent upon this very elegant mechanical tune-vibrating membrane that lies within the cochlea.",
        "And to reconstruct, as you might imagine, will be quite a difficult task.",
        "Nonetheless, it's being attempted, and people are working on ways to try to get stem cells to grow in the ear.",
        "There's also efforts being made to cause the - re-surviving nerve cells even after the sensory hair cells are gone.",
        "If you can encourage the growth of the surviving nerve cells, then the cochlear implant, for instance, could work much better.",
