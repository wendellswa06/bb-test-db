        "And the number of schools and garden clubs and nature societies named after Burbank is really enormous because he was such a popular figure and considered such an example to children.",
        "That's why all the schools are named after him.",
        "Why was he such an example to kids?",
        "He embodied just about every quality that people were looking for.",
        "He was inventive.",
        "He was generous.",
        "He was making new products that were going to help mankind.",
        "He also had a lot to say about child-rearing, which was very interesting.",
        "He believed that children should go out and study nature and learn from the world around him.",
        "He had a lot to say about the importance of wholesome food and going out and gardening and schoolyard gardens, the kinds of issues that are really coming very much back into the news, And he made everybody feel that there were wonderful garden products that they could discover, they could cultivate, they could use.",
        "And that in the years before there were giant, industrial farms, he put a human face on the garden for a lot of people.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So he was out front.",
        "He was a visible - was he an inventor or a scientist?",
        "Well, I don't think we should make that kind of distinction.",
        "I don't think he made that kind of distinction.",
        "He was a scientific inventor.",
        "One of the many fascinating things about his career is that he was inspired to become a plant inventor by reading Charles Darwin.",
        "And a lot of people were reading Darwin in the second half of the 19th century, but they were usually looking at Darwin as somebody who was explaining the past.",
        "Burbank read Darwin and said wait a second.",
        "I can go out and influence the future, and one of the ways he described himself was he said he was a plant evolutor.",

        "He thought that his job was to accelerate evolution.",

        "He's growing potatoes, and he notices a seed pod.",
        "Tell us what happened.",
        "I'm absolutely one of the lucky ones.",
        "I would have been dead if I would have stayed out there another year.",
        "Well, it was a stroke of luck, but it was a perfect illustration of the saying that chance favors the prepared mind because potatoes, as most people may know, are reproduced asexually.",
        "You take a piece of a potato, and you plant it in the ground, and it grows new potatoes from it.",
        "Stems come out of the eyes of the potatoes.",
        "This is a grossly oversimplified account, but…",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "It works for now.",
        "It works, it works.",
        "Burbank noticed a seed pod growing on one of the potato vines in his field.",
        "The potatoes, of course, were underground, but the vines were above.",
        "And the potato is botanically related to the tomato, and the seed pod looks like a tiny little cherry tomato.",
        "And most people would not want to have anything to do with this because you want a potato that's just like the one you planted, a potato that's good.",
        "But Burbank had read Darwin, and Darwin said that every single plant contained the possibility of myriad variations, and Burbank said let me see what happens if I plant these seeds, which is a really startling kind of experiment.",
        "Nobody was doing this kind of thing, including Darwin.",
        "But Burbank was out there planting the seeds of the potato, and he discovered from these 23 seeds that he managed to preserve from this tiny little seed ball that he got basically 23 different kinds of potatoes, and only two of them were of any possible kind of interest.",
        "And one of those two, he saved the seeds again and planted them the next - saved the potatoes again and planted them the next year, and one of them not only bore these great, big, beautiful potatoes but bore a lot of them."

        "And so in a move that was completely characteristic of the rest of his career and drove many research scientists out of their minds, he discarded all the failure, kept the success and went from there.",
        "And that is the Burbank potato.",
        "That's the Russet potato?",
        "Well, originally it wasn't Russet.",
        "It had a smooth, white skin and was in widespread cultivation throughout New England and then in California.",
        "And shortly after the beginning of the 20th century, a potato grower in Colorado named Lou Sweet discovered this spontaneous mutation in his field with a russet skin, and he wisely decided it wouldn't be a good idea to call it the sweet potato, so he called it the Russet Burbank.",
        "Wow.",
        "He didn't just focus on edible plants, though, did he?",
        "No, not at all, and he didn't focus just on vegetables.",
        "He focused a lot on fruits.",
        "He was very interested in berries.",
        "He was very interested in orchard fruit, and he was also quite interested in nuts: walnuts, almonds, various crops like that.",
        "But he was also a innovator in the garden, in the ornamental garden, that is.",
        "He worked with roses.",
        "He worked with various kinds of lilies and gladioli, and he had a long experiment turning the California poppy, which is a orange, bright orange wildflower, turning the California poppy red to have a variation.",
        "That's very interesting.",
        "And one of his most famous creations is the Shasta daisy.",

        "He did the Shasta daisy, yes, and he named it after Mount Shasta, and he spent decades working on it.",
        "It's a hybrid of four different varieties…"

        "Much of - I think people don't realize that much of what we eat today or grow today is not grown from seeds but from grafted plants, you know, like apples and other kinds of fruits.",
        "How involved was Luther Burbank with that technology?",
        "Very, very.",
        "After he developed the Burbank potato, he sold the rights to market it to a New England seed-seller and used the money to move out to California.",
        "And when he got there, there was very little commercial agriculture in California.",
        "What there was was mostly grain, wheat growing.",
        "And he was arriving in Northern California just as the fruit business was beginning to enter the area, and people wanted to plant fruit trees.",
        "They wanted to plant plum trees in particular.",
        "And Burbank developed ways of using grafting to accelerate the growth of plum trees so you can have a kind of instant orchard and not miss what I think you could really accurately call the second gold rush, which was the rush for California fruits and flowers that people were going into.",
        "Parliamentarian Guillaume Garot wrote the law.",
        "He believes the fight against food waste should be as important as other national causes.",
        "Garot says he's contacted by people all over the world who want to do the same thing.",
        "(Speaking in French).",
        "He used grafting both to develop new orchards for people, making fruit-bearing trees much faster than anybody else had been able to, and also in his own experiments to create new kinds of fruit.",
        "Because he realized that if he grafted his various experimental blossoms onto a mother tree he could evaluate them much more quickly.",
        "So he would have a tree that had 20, 50, even two or 300 different kinds of fruit growing on it at one time.",
        "Quite spectacular."
