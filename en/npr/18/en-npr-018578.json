        "I think he was certainly the most famous.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think he was most influential in spreading what was really the pretty radical idea that you could improve the food stock, you could improve plants, you could invent new plants.",
        "This was an idea that became very, very widely accepted.",
        "And it was pretty new.",
        "There was a long tradition, of course, of finding new kinds of agricultural products by basically going around and stealing them or borrowing them from other parts of the world, importing them in pretty aggressive ways.",
        "But Burbank was saying, once they get here, let's see what we can do to make them even better.",

        "Good question.",
        "Well, that's a really interesting question.",
        "And I think that, again, like the distinction between inventor and scientist, it's a kind of separation that Burbank himself didn't really see and didn't act on.",
        "He was doing it all.",
        "He was hybridizing, he was cross-breeding, and then he was selecting from the products.",
        "And he was using grafting to accelerate the process of selection.",
        "So he was doing - those were his three main tools - using hybridization, grafting and selection to create products.",
        "But the other thing that he did that was so inventive was that he was doing it on a massive scale.",
        "Long before Henry Ford was doing his assembly lines, Burbank had massive numbers of experimental plants in his fields.",
        "And his fields weren't very big, so this is very closely packed.",
        "But he was surveying them all and hybridizing, breeding new plants and then selecting the best ones from that.",

        "I mean, you know, today, when any new species or whatever, genetic engineering, first thing we do is we start a venture capital company or get one and have them invest and the inventors, the breeders, the genetic engineering people get very rich.",

        "Very rich, no.",
        "No.",
        "No, he didn't.",
        "And there's a number of interesting reasons for that.",
        "You mentioned venture capitalists, and I think that in the 19th century the venture capitalists of the garden world were the seed sellers."

        "Ah.",
        "And what Burbank did, what a lot of inventors do today, is he would develop a prototype and then he would sell the rights to somebody who is better able to market it.",
        "And so he became involved with some very well-known names like Burpee, for example, who would buy the rights to his products, including very often the naming rights to his products, and then would reproduce them in their own factory fields, let's call it, and put them on the market through their catalogues.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "So…",

        "That's what he was doing.",
        "He didn't have licenses even…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…so he was just selling the rights.",
        "And part of the reason he became so enormously famous was not only that he was a wonderfully idiosyncratic and attractive character, which he certainly was, but also because the people who were selling these products pretty quickly realized that they could get a premium for anything that came from Luther Burbank's garden, so they were very interested in promoting his fame.",
        "But another thing that was going on then is that there were no patents for plants."

        "There weren't, but - and there weren't until after Burbank's death.",
        "But one of the many fascinating episodes of his career, which extended after his death, is that after he had been dead for five years there was a movement in Congress to pass what became the Plant Patent Act of 1930.",
        "And one of the big arguments in the congressional debate was that we'll never have another Luther Burbank if we don't allow plants to be treated as intellectual property.",
        "So his spirit and his celebrity and his position as a person who is really creating new plants for the benefit of mankind influenced that debate.",
        "And of course what happened after that is a whole other story.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that was the whole era at the time.",

        "It's changed the supermarkets' practices,\"\" he says, \"\"they're more attentive to their environment, and they give more.\"\" But most important, says Garot, is that a supermarket is now seen as more than just a profit center.",

        "They were.",
        "They were.",
        "And I think that's - two things that make Burbank so relevant to what's going on today is, one, first of all, the way that people are becoming much more interested in the garden and in what can grow in their home, in their local farms, in their community farms, different kinds of crops and how they're suited to the local agriculture, which is really what Burbank was doing, because he was working in an era before there was all this long distance shipping and airfreight going on.",
        "So he wanted to have products that could grow in the local environment."

        "He uses a lot of biblical language, and he says never since the dawn of time has there been anything so amazing as my giant walnut, my white blackberry.",
        "A lot of his creations involve taking an object of nature and making it seem as though it was doing something that was completely antithetical to its nature.",
