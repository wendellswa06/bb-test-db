        "Part of the reason, I think, people - CBS is in the news so much is because people care about it, because for all those years, Roger Mudd, it was such an important part of people's lives, in the years that you describe, and one of the remarkable things about that is these voice and faces that we all got to know so well, and that, well, I think we trusted in ways that I'm not sure anybody can be trusted these days.",

        "It is true that in that 20-year stretch that I wrote about, from 1960 to 1980, CBS became the dominant news network.",
        "NBC had been ahead from the late '50s with Huntley and Brinkley, and ABC was not even a factor.",
        "It was a weak third and became a real competitor after Rune Arledge came along and began to raid to the other two networks.",
        "But during that period, beginning with the election of John Kennedy and ending with the election of Ronald Reagan, there was no group of men and women who so dominated the coverage from Washington.",
        "And during that period, official Washington, which had been used to being on a cycle with the newspapers, the 24-hour cycle with the newspapers, the government shut down about five o'clock.",
        "With the rise of television, the government stayed open until seven o'clock because they had to know what the networks were saying.",
        "That became the new deadline for the government to send out press releases.",
        "It changed the culture a great deal.",
        "You know, what was interesting about those days is that there were not nearly as many reporters as there are today.",
        "You had NBC and CBS and there weren't even any national newspapers except for the Wall Street Journal in those days.",
        "The New York Times was not distributed on a nation scale in those times.",
        "So, household names were actually people who were covering beats in Washington.",
        "People like Roger, who was covering Capitol Hill, Marvin Kalb, who was covering the State Department, Dan Rather, who was our White House correspondent, Daniel Schorr, who covered general assignments, and kind of up on Cloud 97 up there, above all of us, was Eric Sevareid, who did the commentaries in those days."

        "It's very, very difficult for people to become known.",
        "But the important thing, and the real reason they became so well-known and trusted, is because they were so good.",

        "You commented that you don't believe your comments are really applicable to broadcast news today because of the variety, and that you also believe radio news is the last great hope for broadcast.",
        "But I'm just curious to know, what is your evaluation of the quality of broadcast television news today?",
        "Just to summarize, the speech at Washington & Lee, in a few words, that the printed word would outlast the broadcast word.",
        "But go ahead, go ahead.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I remember Diane's question, and I think perhaps my answer, if she asked it again, would be a little different.",
