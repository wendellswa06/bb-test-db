        "And then maybe - you know, over a span of time, gradually up until maybe 2050 when we're like, whoa, what is this going to - I think it's going to be scary, but - what's your opinion on that?",

        "You mentioned convergence, which was a major fad - I always think of it as a fad - where - when a newspaper owns a radio station and a TV station, the reporters, in effect, commingle.",
        "And they use each other's reports.",
