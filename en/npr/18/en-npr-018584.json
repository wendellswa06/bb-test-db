        "The choice program allowed vets to get private care if it was going to take the VA too long to see them or if they lived at least 40 miles from the nearest VA clinic.",
        "It didn't get off to a great start.",
        "It seemed to be just adding another layer of red tape to the whole process.",
        "And it's said to be working smoother now, but it hasn't reduced wait times.",
        "And Trump's talked about enhancing that program, but the basic problem remains - a shortage of doctors and nurses in the VA and outside the VA.",
