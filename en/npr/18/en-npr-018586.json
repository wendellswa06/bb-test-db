        "Good to see you three.",
        "So I just want to tie a bow on this week with a word from each of you about the Democratic debate this past week.",
        "It was the first for the Democrats this year - a record-breaker for a Democratic debate.",
        "Some 15 million people watched.",
        "So before we let it go - no, I'm not going to break into the song - before we let it go, I wanted to check in and ask what you thought about it.",
        "Corey, do you want to start?",
        "Sure.",
        "I thought it was a fantastic night for the leading candidates, and I thought it was a fantastic night for Democrats overall.",
        "If you - once again, if you took a look at the contrast between what Democrats were able to do on that one evening in two hours versus what the Democrat - the Republicans have been able to do in four hours, it was extraordinary.",
        "It was a high-minded debate, a lot of good conversation about important issues that Americans care about.",
        "And we got to see what a debate is like without Donald Trump.",
        "It's actually a really thoughtful conversation, so I thought it was a great night.",
        "Anybody get any particular lift out of it in your opinion?",
        "No.",
        "I don't think - while we have seen a little bit of movement with Hillary in New Hampshire, she's also spent $31 million worth of advertising in New Hampshire, so you can't really attest it to that.",
        "But I think it's going to be even for the most part as we go into this next round, just before the next one.",
        "Now, one of the moments a lot of people were talking about afterwards, Bridget, came when Sen.",
        "Bernie Sanders actually spoke up for Sen.",
        "Clinton on the issue of her private email server.",
        "In case you're one of the three people who has not seen this clip, I'm going to play it for you now.",
        "Here it is.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE)",
        "The secretary is right, and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.",
        "Thank you - me, too, me, too (laughter).",
        "Her, too.",
        "Now, Bridget, you wrote for PJ Media that many conservatives believe that Sanders won the debate.",
        "A lot of people were saying that Clinton kind of got the edge out of it.",
        "You're saying a lot of conservatives think Sanders won, which is interesting to me because a lot of progressives think so, too.",
        "So tell me why you said that.",
        "Well, it's kind of a mix of GOP support for Sanders' thinking - you know, what he might be able to do against Hillary.",
        "But some of it - and I've heard this from a lot of people for months now - is kind of admiration that, you know, of the fact that he's a politician who's proud of his views and doesn't gloss over everything.",
        "So as someone who's covered the Hill for a long time, I was really looking forward - I'm like let Bernie be Bernie, you know?",
        "Show the rest of the nation what we see at 2 a.m. on the Senate floor during a spending bill.",
        "And so it took him a little while to get going.",
        "I think, you know, there was a little bit of nerves in there, which is kind of weird to put with Bernie's name.",
        "But once he got going and he started making comments like that, you know, I think people really got to see who he was.",
        "And also, when he was challenged on his views on gun control, you know, this is a guy who - he does not shy away from his views.",
        "And, you know, we saw it, like, a couple months ago.",
        "He was doing a town hall in Alexandria, and he was challenged by someone in the audience about gun control.",
        "And he stuck to why he voted the way he did.",
        "Basically, I'm representing my constituents.",
        "And so to see him do that on the national stage, too, kind of highlights how it's going to be hard for people to hit at him because he doesn't have that source of inconsistencies."

        "Interesting.",
        "Arsalan, get the final slice on this.",
        "And if you would, throw in a word about Joe Biden, who wasn't there, but - I don't know, are we still waiting on bated breath?",
        "I think we are.",
        "I think what's interesting is that, you know, just like we see in many presidential primary debates, especially on the Republican side, you see people running to the right.",
        "And it's nice, you know, as a liberal Democrat to see, finally, candidates running to the left, right?",
        "I think that, obviously, Hillary is seen as the presumptive nominee.",
        "But it's nice to be able to see her actually embrace the title of progressive.",
        "You know, for the first time in my life we, you know, see the word socialist being, you know, thrown about in the mainstream media and not in a pejorative sense.",
        "And so I think that, you know, just like the Republicans...",
        "Well, that depends.",
        "Well, right.",
        "But I'm saying it is becoming more normalized in the sense that, you know, if we have Tea Party Republicans, you know, we can also have leftist, socialist, you know, political debates as well.",
        "And so it's nice to see that - in that paradigm.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, finally, let's switch gears and talk about fantasy football.",
        "Yep.",
        "The fantasy sports industry has exploded.",
        "More than 50 million people are playing and winning money with fantasy sports, according to the industry's trade group.",
        "But the question is, is it gambling?",
        "On Thursday, Nevada's regulators shut down DraftKings and FanDuel in that state, the two biggest fantasy sports companies, saying that they need gambling licenses, which they don't have.",
        "And just yesterday, we heard that a grand jury subpoenaed the main trade group for fantasy sports as part of a federal investigation.",
        "That's according to The Wall Street Journal.",
        "So Arsalan, I understand that you partake.",
        "I...",
        "Do I have that right?",
        "I love me some fantasy football, but I love me some unpaid fantasy football.",
