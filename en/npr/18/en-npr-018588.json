        "Both the Obama and Romney campaigns put out rough totals this week for their April fundraising.",
        "The Obama total exceeded $43 million.",
        "For Romney, it was more than $40.1 million.",
        "That marked a 20 percent drop for the Obama effort from its March total, and, more significant, it showed a March to April surge of 50 percent for Romney, a surge trigged partly by his success in the primaries, but also by an influx of big donor money that he couldn't access before.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Well, thanks for talking with us, Lovisa.",
        "That's because last month, presumptive nominee Romney could start doing what President Obama could do all along: that is, solicit money for his national party committee.",
        "While a donor can give the candidate's own committee $2,500 for the primaries and another $2,500 for the general election, the maximum to give to a join fundraising operation is a shade under $76,000 - $5,000 for the candidate, and the rest to be spread among the national party and various state committees.",
        "The Romney campaign said that it and the Republican National Committee have combined cash on hand of more than $61 million.",
        "That's less than half of what the Obama operation reported a month ago.",
        "The complete reports for April, including the Obama cash on hand, are due to be released Sunday.",
        "Peter Overby, NPR News, Washington.",

        "There's a new sense of urgency in cities on the East Coast after Hurricane Sandy.",
        "Scientists can't predict when the next big storm will come, but they can say that a warmer climate is likely to make Atlantic storms bigger and increase flooding.",
        "The Boston area is one urban center that's trying to prepare and NPR's Christopher Joyce went there to find out what they're doing.",
        "From Kerry Emanuel's sixth floor office at MIT, you can look down at the snow-covered Charles River as it snakes through Boston down to the harbor.",
        "It's a beautiful city where three rivers meet the Atlantic, except a lot of that water wants to get into the city and here's why.",
        "First, the Atlantic is warming.",
        "Emanuel says that puts more water vapor up into the air.",
        "That means that a given hurricane is likely to rain much more in the future than it does today.",
        "That's a big deal because a lot of the deaths and injuries and loss of property and so forth in these storms come from fresh water flooding produced by rain.",
        "Then there's sea level.",
        "Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist, says warming climate is likely to change wind patterns.",
        "And those wind patterns can make a difference locally to how high the sea level it is.",
        "So, for example, sea levels forecast arrives faster along the U.S.",
        "East Coast than it does globally."

        "So you get flooding rivers and a surging ocean that meet in Boston Harbor.",

        "You've got high-rises, as well as 19th and even 18th century buildings of brick right up to the edge of the water, though.",
        "There's not really much room between the ends of the building and where the water is.",
        "That's made Boston Harbor a popular place for business as well as tourism.",
        "Giant office buildings, chic restaurants, the Boston Tea Party Museum where they reenact 18th century history and throw more tea into the harbor just for fun.",
        "Boston has several waterfront neighborhoods like this and buildings dating back centuries.",
        "Vivian Lee(ph) lives in one.",
        "Many of them are very solidly build, but the mechanicals and boilers and such are in the basement level and that will be the problem.",
        "Mechanicals meaning electric switches, water pumps, fuel tanks.",
        "Lee is trying to change that.",
        "She runs the Boston Harbor Association.",
        "This month, the group issued a study of what future storms could do to Boston.",
        "Sandy just grazed Boston, but the study shows that if a storm like Sandy hit Boston directly, it would flood 6.6 percent of the city.",
        "If sea levels go up by 2 and a half feet, as many scientists say they could by 2100, it would flood 30 percent of the city.",
        "Lee recalls the response to the study she got from the owners of Boston's Harbor Towers high-rises.",
        "If your projections are correct, sea level rise could knock out the boilers for two of the largest residential towers in Boston.",
        "That's not going to be good for those residents.",
        "The Association's study advises property owners to identify low-lying doors or vent openings, underground garages, basement power equipment and figure out how to protect them from flooding.",
        "That will cost a lot, but Lee expects people to pay it rather than leaving.",
        "The issue of retreating right now is not palatable for political reasons and I, frankly, think a lot of the residents don't want to move.",
        "You know, you see, particularly a lot of older people, saying this is where I've lived all my life."

        "So how do you deal with entrances to garages or to lobbies, I mean, subway entrance platforms?",
        "As Boston plug zones expand, it will cost more to build there.",

        "He believes builders are willing to pay the price.",
        "I'm not saying at all that we retreat from the waterfront, but it is inherently more expensive.",
        "It's also inherently more valuable.",
        "But no matter how well property owners prepare, they could still lose it all as climate changes.",
        "One reason many are willing to stomach that risk is that governments may bail them out.",

        "Things like allowing people to keep their children, their adult children up to age 26 on their health plan.",
        "So there are provisions of the law that remain very popular that people would like to keep.",
        "Can Republicans just leave the law on the books but then defund it, refuse to pay for parts of it?",
        "Well, that's not so easy.",
        "A lot of the funding for this law is automatic.",
        "So some of the things that they could defund are some of the smaller things, and they may try to do that, but the main parts of the law would be very difficult to defund.",

        "But that's not a central portion of what the law does going forward.",
        "OK.",
        "So what else can Republicans do?",
        "Well, what most people expect Republicans to do is now that they have control back over the committees, is they're going to have a lot of hearings.",
        "And they're going to drag people who are trying to implement this bill in the Department of Health and Human Services up to Capitol Hill to testify.",
        "Now, that could be a double-edged sword too because one of the things that we know is that people don't quite understand what's in this law yet.",
        "You have all of these hearings, there's a chance that people will find out more about what's in this law and they may like it better.",
        "One question here, Julie Rovner - everyone's anticipating a lot of conflict but I wonder if it's possible that by pushing and testing this law and perhaps changing it here and there where they can, is there a possibility that Republicans might actually make this law better?"
