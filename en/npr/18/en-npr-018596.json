        "Sleepovers for the voting machines.",
        "Yes.",
        "And what's the idea of polling workers taking the machines home with them?",
        "Well, there's so much equipment that the poll workers have to take, not only the machine, but all the other information - the signs they have to hang, the ballots, the ballot boxes, the sealed containers, locks, seals, everything to replace before they come back - that we have a choice of delivering them to polling places and leaving them to sit there or have our presiding judges pick them up a day or two before the election and take everything to their homes.",
        "The secretary of state has made her choice, and we will follow it, but you know, in my mind, with our security practices that we have in place, we've never had an incident where anything has ever been tampered with in all the years that we've done the sleepovers.",
        "Isn't it odd, though, that a couple of days of keeping the voting machines in private houses, where they might be perfectly trustworthy people, something about it seems - it just seems less secure on the face of it than having them even for a few days, you know, locked in some room in a public place.",
        "Well, I think that that is her feeling, that this will give the public a better feeling of the security of the machines.",
        "So we are looking into how to implement this new directive and rule that she has made.",
        "Other counties in the state have already been delivering them and securing them at polling places, so we will do the same.",
        "Ms.",
        "Dibble, I'm just wondering before I let you go, I was just curious whether, apart from the logistics of all this on Election Day, where do you put the voting machines, how do you get them to the polling place at the right time - do you think that for poll workers, there might be just a little civic pride involved in being the keeper of the voting machines for a couple of days at home and the dimension of all this that is maybe not entirely rational but has been of some benefit to people all these years to feel that responsibility?",
        "You could be right.",
        "I'll be curious to see what the poll workers have to say.",
        "They may be happy.",
        "They're heavy, you know, and they have to go home, get them out of their car, carry them in the house, because they can't be out in the cold, then they got to - on election morning, they've got to put them back out in their car and they go to the polling place, and then all four poll workers carry them in."

        "Faulkner bought the antebellum house in 1930 and named it Rowan Oak after the qualities of the two trees; rowan for serenity and oak for strength.",
        "It was built in 1848, and the house was in disrepair when William Faulkner bought it.",

        "After taking her seat at the witness table and introducing friends and family, including her husband, Nobel Prize-winning economist George Akerlof, Yellen confidently launched into a short prepared statement.",
        "It included an assessment of the Fed's role in trying to boost the economy out of the Great Recession, with extraordinary measures that she helped author as the Fed's vice chair.",
        "We've made good progress but we have further to go to regain the ground lost in the crisis and the recession.",
        "Yellen arrived at today's hearing with little doubt that she would be confirmed, since Democrats hold a 55 to 45 majority in the Senate.",
        "The question was how much pushback she might get from Republicans who disagree with the Fed's massive quantitative easing.",

        "I think we have seen a very meaningful recovery in automobile sales, spurred in part by low interest rates.",

        "When I say cool, it's cool because a lot of dedicated people that are entitled to carry that weapon, and carried it in the military, would like to shoot it.",

        "That's when I say cool.",
