        "And Aaron Sorkin proved that to be wrong.",

        "You don't have to worry about the people who aren't interested in politics, because if you get enough of those who are and want to laugh and, you know, maybe they've love John Goodman or they read \"\"Doonesbury,\"\" you're going to, you know, get enough people in the tent to make money and subsidize more such television.",

        "Exactly.",

        "Online television is knocking at the door, and it's going to provide a lot more options for people, a lot more experimentation.",
