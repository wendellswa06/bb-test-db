        "He says the new government there may want to give negotiations a chance before falling back on a military approach.",

        "Is that right?",
        "I kind of started by thinking about my own teenage years.",
        "I went through a lot, and I wanted to tap into those emotions for a film.",
        "And my next train of thought was how different it must be to be a teenager today when so much of your life is lived through a screen, and everything you do is documented on social media.",
        "And I just started exploring things in that world.",
        "And I found what you see in the film, which are meet and greets.",
        "And once I looked up what a meet and greet was, it kind of all came out of that.",
        "OK, so meet and greets play a big role in this.",
        "I guess there are meet and greets for all kinds of influencers.",
        "But for these boy broadcasts, right, they play a particular role.",
        "What is that?",
        "So essentially, these girls are watching these boys all day, every day.",
        "But they can - this could go on for years without them ever having actually met them in person.",
        "And so the idea of a meet and greet was that I'm going to give you this in-person experience with me for the first time in your life.",
        "And these girls will travel far and wide to do that.",
        "And it's basically just taking that interaction off the computer and putting it into real life.",
        "Well, I think that for people who aren't familiar with what's going on with teenagers, you know, it might be confusing because I think people might understand the concept of, like, meeting the boys in your - the band that you like.",
        "But these guys, these young guys, these boy broadcasts - they're just guys, right?",
        "They're not selling, like, we're in a band.",
