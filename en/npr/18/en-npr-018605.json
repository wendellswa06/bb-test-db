        "A famous picture of me interviewing penguins was taken by Ms. Bouton.",
        "But I was never fully aware of the extent of the private battle she has been fighting, an invisible condition that affects 50 million Americans, I'm talking about hearing loss.",
        "If you think hearing loss is something only older people have to worry about, you may be surprised to find out, as I was after reading her book, that 50 million people suffer from some degree of hearing impairment, and it can happen at any age.",
        "Ms. Bouton went deaf at the age of 30.",
        "Today she has help from a cochlear impact and hearing aids, but it's still a struggle.",
        "In her new book she describes how she learned to cope with hearing loss and why we need to do more to address this widespread but misunderstood problem.",

        "In those days you could call the weather, and you could call time.",
        "And so I made various calls to see whether I can hear out of both ears, and I couldn't hear out of my left ear.",
        "I wasn't initially that alarmed because I, like all children of the '60s and '70s, had gone to my share of rock concerts and had lost my hearing temporarily before, and I thought maybe this was a temporary loss.",
