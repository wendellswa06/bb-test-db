        "And they couldn't use my old mold.",
        "They had to recalibrate the size of my ear in the shape of the hearing aid.",
        "So your mother probably was, and I think a lot of people, even today, are wearing hearing aids that don't fit and that don't really work because they don't wear them for starters or because they haven't been properly programmed or because they're not the right hearing aids for that person.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "When you got your implant, did you - it says in the book that you had to relearn how to hear again.",

        "So I practiced with her.",

        "Please explain that.",
        "Well, deaf with a capital D refers to the deaf community which is a community with a culture and a language, American Sign Language.",
