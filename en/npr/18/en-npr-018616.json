        "So the recruiting program is called Football Dreams, and I'm guessing that there are people, particularly in this country, who've never heard about it, particularly given that it's such - it was on such a massive scale.",
        "So how did this whole thing start?",
        "Well, it started - you'd have to go back 20 years ago when one of the richest men in the world, a member of the Qatari royal family named Sheikh Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani, decided that he was going to make it his mission to produce a world-class Qatari national team.",
        "First thing he did was he spent a billion dollars and he built Aspire Academy - which is probably the highest-tech sports academy in the world - in Doha but quickly realized he didn't have the players that he needed at home to produce the kind of team he imagined.",
        "And so he enlisted the help of a Spanish scout who was once the youth director at Barcelona and helped jumpstart Lionel Messi's career.",
        "And the scout, Josep Colomer, set off across Africa to basically find the young players that the sheikh needed and over the course of 10 years, held tryouts for over 5 million 13-year-old boys, looking for soccer's next superstars.",
        "And he had some crazy adventures.",
        "I mean, there's this one story that you tell, among many, of where he was in the Niger Delta region, where I think people who follow international affairs know there have been some vicious conflicts over the oil pipeline there - right?",

        "He had to rely on militia men to protect him, right?",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "This was during the first year of the search in 2007.",
        "And he was in the Niger Delta at the height of the war between the militants and the government over the region's oil.",

        "But one of the locals wanted him to go to his fishing village, which was about an hour's boat ride away, to go scout the local kids there.",
        "But it was one of the most dangerous parts of the Delta.",
        "And when he showed up at the dock to get into the boat, he realized that he couldn't take his police guards with him because the militants wouldn't allow armed government forces into their territory.",
        "But the local told him that the militants wanted him to come because they'd never had anyone scout their kids - not even a Nigerian scout, much less one who had been at Barcelona.",
        "And he had a senior militant leader with him who would escort Josep Colomer, the scout, to the village, make sure nothing happened to him and bring him back.",
        "And even though the police guards thought this was a crazy thing to do, the scout had been so obsessed with finding future talent his whole life that he got in the boat with the militant and went to the village and conducted the search and luckily came back without being kidnapped.",
        "And I actually, during my research, went and recreated his trip.",
        "I went with the same militants in the same boat to the same town and went to the same field, so it was an incredible experience.",
        "Talk a little bit, if you would, about just what the academy had to offer.",
        "I mean, the fact of the matter is these families were sending their boys away - their little boys to go off - some of them had never been out of their villages.",
        "Yeah, it's kind of amazing when you think about it.",
        "I mean, these are kids who grew up playing on dusty dirt fields across Africa, often barefoot or in plastic sandals, dreaming that someday a foreign scout would show up, see them from the sidelines, point to them and just say you're marked for greatness.",
        "Come with me.",
        "I'm going to take you to Europe and make all your dreams come true.",

        "And for them, they saw it as a stepping point to their dreams coming true, to making it to Europe, to making it to the biggest clubs.",
