        "Thank you very much for having me.",
        "Looks - tell us about the forecast.",
        "It looks pretty intense.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, the way this forecast that we put out was in early April and at that time, we were calling for a pretty active hurricane season.",
        "A typical season has about 10 name storms, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes.",
        "We're currently predicting 15 name storms, eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes.",
        "So, if you kind of want to summarize it with one number, about 160 percent of the average season.",
        "So, yeah, pretty active.",
        "And so, it looks something like 2005 which spawned Katrina.",
        "Well, no, not necessarily.",
        "I mean, 2005 had 15 hurricanes and 28 name storms, so we're not necessarily expecting to see that much activity.",
        "But, certainly, we do feel that conditions are going to be a lot more conducive for a lot of storms than say there were last year when we only had three hurricanes.",
        "Is it basically looking through the hurricane record, the seasonal records, the maps and comparing what you see on those when it was a stormy year and seeing what's shaping up this year?",
        "Yeah, that's correct.",
        "Basically, the way that we come up with our forecast is we use historical data and we use the past.",
        "Like you said, what we do is we basically know which years in the past were active hurricane seasons and which years in the past were quiet seasons.",
        "And then what you do is you try to look and see what sets of climate conditions, how - what was the atmosphere like and what was the ocean like in active seasons in the past versus inactive seasons in the past, then you find that certain sets of conditions do occur.",
        "One of the common ones that we use is El Nino.",
        "When you have El Nino, which is warmer than normal waters in the tropical Pacific, you tend to have fewer storms in the Atlantic and that's what we saw last year.",
        "But that El Nino appears to be dying now, so we don't think we're going to have that to help keep the season quiet this year.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So - El Nino is dying down and what other conditions make it look like a bad hurricane season?",
        "Well, one of the things that we've really noticed over the last several months is we've seen a very strong warming of the waters in the tropical Atlantic.",
        "The waters right now in the tropical Atlantic are running at near record levels, so certainly, very toasty right now.",
        "Now just because they're warm now doesn't guarantee they're going to be warm during the August to October period when we see most of our major hurricanes, but there is a fairly strong correlation there so that's another reason why we expect the season to be pretty active with the very warm waters that we have right now."

        "A question coming from Second Life from Pierre Mantis Burman(ph) says, will the oil spill in the Gulf have any impact on the hurricane season?",
        "Well, that's good question.",
        "There's been a lot of people asking similar questions.",
        "I think, really, when you get any sort of storm of any strength, say even a tropical storm, basically, the oil - the water would mix the oil and - or I should say the winds would mix the oil and the water together, so you wouldn't necessarily have the reduced evaporation from the oil slick.",
        "I think one of the big concerns is that if we did get a hurricane in the Gulf and it happened to, you know, drive - have a fairly significant storm surge, it could drive the oily water further inland which could make a real mess.",
        "So, I think, certainly, there is some cause for concern, but obviously there's a lot of question as to how much oil is going to be left by the time that the hurricane season really ramps up.",
        "Yeah, well, we don't know the answer to that question.",
        "No, exactly, we don't know the answer to that question and hopefully, we won't find out the answer this year.",
        "So when you say really ramps up, what range of time are you speaking of?",
        "Well, basically, the most - even though the hurricane season starts on June 1st, then you certainly can get storms in June and July, about 90 and 95 percent of all major hurricane activity occurs after the 1st of August.",
        "So - and if you really want to pick a one-month time period where most of the storms occur, it's between about August 20th and September 20th is when you get, say, about 65, 70 percent of all your major hurricane activity.",
        "So that's the month where storms are most likely, but certainly you can obviously get storms in August and October, and even earlier and later in the season.",
        "Do you see any connection between climate change and hurricanes in terms of the increasing water temperature, stuff like that?",
        "We keep hearing that the storms may be more intense.",
        "Well, that's a good question.",
        "Basically, what we find is that especially in the tropical Atlantic, there's this kind of multidecadal variability where your Gulf...",

        "A multi - 25 to 30-year variability.",

        "We see a lot of major hurricanes and then it gets quiet and we have fewer.",
        "And if you look back at historical data, you can see these cycles going back to the late 19th century.",
        "So we don't really - we don't - and what I've done a little work looking globally at storms...",
        "Right.",
        "...and now obviously, observational data globally isn't always the greatest, and you may have some uncertainties especially if you go further back in time.",
        "But based on the data that we have, we really havent seen any observable trend in storms getting more intense...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...with the fact that even water temperatures are warming because even if humans are causing global warming and causing the temperatures to warm, the warming not - doesnt just take place at the sea surface, it also takes place at upper levels in the atmosphere.",
        "And basically, the atmosphere doesnt really become a lot less unstable.",
        "Basically, the stability of the atmosphere remains about the same so you wouldn't necessarily expect to see stronger storms.",

        "Yes, here's hoping.",

        "One is you show everyone in the world - not just Americans but everyone overseas, including these Russians - how much you know about what has taken place, including with what level of specificity.",
        "The detail in some of these indictments is really amazing.",
        "The Americans knew, for example, that after the FBI revealed one day that there had been this cyberattack on a state-level election system, one of the Russians at the GRU sitting at his desk, at his computer workstation, deleted his browser search history.",
        "So they had that level of detail about who he was and where he was working and what he was doing.",
        "It's also a way of showing them - the Russians in this case - that you're inside their system.",
        "So they're attacking American systems.",
        "These indictments allow the United States to say, we're inside of your systems, the GRU.",
        "And if I know intelligence agencies, people at the GRU are probably going crazy taking their hair out, trying to figure out how the Americans got in their systems and were able to learn all this.",
        "OK.",
        "So even of these officers, these GRU officers don't get extradited, will these indictments against them affect their lives in some real way in Russia?",
        "They could.",
        "One thing Rosenstein said is that every once in a while one of these people who've been indicted by the United States will travel to a third country that has an agreement that enables them to be arrested and extradited.",
        "So what the United States has basically done is restricted how these guys can travel in places - for example, in Western Europe - where they might actually come into the power of Interpol or some allied government.",
        "The other thing that Rosenstein said is evidence in indictments is sufficient for the Treasury Department to impose sanctions.",
        "That's what happened with indictment earlier this year.",
        "So now the Treasury Department if it wants to can take the material from these court documents and sanction the financial activities of these Russians who've been identified.",
        "But does that mean there is also a national security risk involved with using indictments like this?",
        "I mean, the risk that the United States could tip its hand too much.",
        "Yeah, that's always been part of the conversation inside the government.",
        "And there are people who don't want to reveal anything about what the United States can do, which is the tradeoff with revealing what the Justice Department has revealed in these most recent indictments.",
        "There's also limits to how effective they can be.",
        "There's no question about that.",
