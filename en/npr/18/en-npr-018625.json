        "Farai, this was mainly about, though, this policy rollback, about the election, congressional elections, that are coming up.",
        "When those Northeastern and Midwestern Republicans went in and said, `Look, you're not running again, but we're running next time, and in our districts we've got all these union people, we've got all these people.",
        "Do you want the Republicans to lose control of the House?",
        "And the answer was no. `Well, then you need to do something about this.",
        "So it wasn't because the president decided suddenly he loved unions or he loved black people or he loved whatever it is he loves.",
        "It was about, `Are we gonna keep control and are we gonna keep these seats or are we not going to keep these seats?'",
        "Scientists were worried about losing federal funding for research, even the NASA satellites that collect basic climate data.",
        "Also, as Juan was suggesting, that `he said-she said' visit with the senators.",
        "People coming out of the meetings thinks she says one thing, and then she says, `No, I didn't say that.",
        "President Bush wants someone on this court who he said would not change their minds if they sat their for 20 years.",
        "So he wants a bigot.",
        "Not a racial bigot, a bigot.",
        "Because a person who doesn't learn, a person who doesn't grow, a person who doesn't listen, a person who doesn't engage with their colleagues is a bigot.",
        "So maybe he's looking for somebody who is loyal to him and that was a question that even Senator Specter said he would put to Harriet Miers.",
        "`How distant can you be from the president you were serving as personal counsel?",
        "So I think this was a self-inflicted wound.",
        "I think he will now go and play both the race card, and the female card, and he will probably pick Janice Rogers Brown.",
        "Because we all ...(unintelligible) cultural war.",
        "Mary Frances Berry...",
        "Farai, I think that one of the scary things about this, having watched administrations and knowing about the history of what happens in second terms, is it means that many people on the president's staff are tired and they didn't adequately vet this whole thing.",
        "And he needs some new blood.",
        "He needs some new thinking, which affects us on a whole range of issues because anyone who sat down and thought about it could have predicted that much of the--many of the questions that have been raised about Miers, given her background--Why didn't they know about the speech that she made that raised a number of issues?",
        "Why didn't they know about all this stuff instead of having it come out?",
        "So they're a bunch of tired people over there, and that's dangerous for us on a whole range of issues, but every election is mainly about courts, Supreme Court, because the people are there for life, and the public can't figure that out.",
        "I mean, we keep trying to explain it all the time, that it's about the court.",
        "So the important thing for us for the future that he does, the most important thing, is who these people are we put on the court.",
        "And it's important because we're--in this country we are in a culture war.",
        "There is a divide about race.",
        "There is a divide over affirmative action.",
        "There is a divide over reproductive freedom rights.",
        "There is a divide over the rights of same-sex couples and other minorities.",
        "There's a divide over civil liberties issues, generally.",
        "Civil liberties and civil rights, exactly, and...",
        "Well...",
        "...in this cultural war, I say, `Bring it on.",
        "Make sure we have a candidate who's going to support and protect civil liberties and civil rights, not a person who's going to undermine the core fabric of our nation."

        "Yeah, this may embolden the Democrats, but let me turn--Michael, you have talked about this being a self-inflicted wound.",
        "There was another incident this week in the political universe that also shows that the Bush administration may not be as strong in terms of asserting its will as it has been in the past.",
        "There's something called the Davis-Bacon Act that offers people working on disaster recovery, for example, the local prevailing wage.",
        "The Bush administration wanted to roll that back for people working on Katrina recovery, but this week they conceded that the act would stand.",
        "Michael, and then Roland, how significant is that?",
        "This may fly under the radar of this week's news, but it is going to impact the thousands, tens of thousands of people who are working on Katrina recovery, including some of the African-American folks who were displaced in the first place.",
        "Well, I think it's significant in the sense that I tihnk we should pay people decent wages.",
        "We should pay people prevailing wages.",
        "And you can't use the occasion of a hurricane or a natural disaster to waive the law.",
        "And when you did waive the law, you had abuses.",
        "You had people who were hiring undocumented workers and abusing them and not paying them because they were undocumented, and running away from their responsibilities.",
        "And you also had an avoidance of hiring local people.",
        "You had people from out of state who were coming into New Orleans called, quote, unquote, \"\"rebuilding.\"\" You cannot have the reconstruction of New Orleans to the exclusion of blacks.",
        "And, Farai...",
        "You can't have the reconstruction of New Orleans to the exclusions of local people.",
        "And that really is where the president was getting nailed.",
        "Senator Trent Lott was extremely vocal on that whole issue of local folks in Mississippi being passed over.",
        "The same thing in Alabama and Louisiana, as well, but I think what you see is this is also a victory for those moderate Republicans, many whom who come from states where they have strong labor, where they have significant Democratic pockets in those states, and they made it perfectly clear that, you know, `We're going to get nailed if you don't make a change,' and so they are united and they forced the hand of this administration.",
        "And I think it is pathetic when you have the Association of Manufacturers and others who suggest that this is wrong to pay people appropriately and then they begin to bring up things like waste and fraud when that was simply a matter of these construction companies and others wanting to pocket as much money as possible as opposed to paying the workers to do so.",
        "They also lined up to give blood for a Greek-only blood bank.",
        "Ilias Panagiotaros, a parliamentary deputy for Golden Dawn, dismisses the connection between his party and the attacks.",
        "Police records show that we have about 85 percent of all incidents that have to do with attacks are made by illegal immigrants against Greeks.",
        "This is the one and only truth."

        "Well, Farai, it was Sheryl Swoopes who said that even her mother has yet to accept the fact that she is gay.",
        "Also you're going to have some issues there on both sides of the aisle because when she made the comment that `I was not born gay,' I read a comment from an activist gay journalist who was very upset by saying they were troubled by that.",
        "And so you're going to have some gays and lesbians who are concerned because she said, `I wasn't born gay,' and those...",

        "Trust me, you're going to have the conversation.",
        "And so from an advertiser's standpoint, yes, there is going to be some backlash, and I would not be surprised if she does not continue to get additional endorsements even though she's considered to be the Michael Jordan of the WNBA.",
        "Mary, very briefly.",
        "I think that you can be gay and then be ignorant about why you're gay and make unscientific statements like she did, but in terms of the overall reaction to her, given the homophobia in the black community that one has to fight on a daily basis..."
