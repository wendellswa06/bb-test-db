        "And, Ron, let's go back for a minute to this 9-11 Commission report.",
        "What has been the administration's response, and is this a big problem for them?",
        "It is a big problem for them, Madeleine, because, as you were saying a moment ago, it combines with the continuing fallout from Katrina.",
        "And we saw a lot more of that over the weekend with the release of these e-mails between the White House and officials in Louisiana.",
        "It paints an unflattering picture of their competence, and it undercuts a basic image of this administration as being can-do problem-solvers, the basic pitch that they've made us safer in the world over the last four years.",
        "The administration has claimed credit for having prevented any more 9/11s from happening, and it's been mostly an implicit claim, but it's been sometimes quite an explicit one, too.",
        "And that's what Iraq's supposed to be all about, too, right?",
        "Yes, that's been the first justification for Iraq, although lately we've heard more about how we're creating a new Iraq and a new dynamic of democracy in the Middle East generally.",
        "The president always gets back to the issue of American security being secured by going to Iraq sooner or later.",
        "And this week, we'll hear more of that because he makes the second in his series of four speech-on-the-war themes Wednesday here in Washington.",
        "And going on to Capitol Hill, we're waiting with bated breath to see if the charges against former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay will be dismissed.",
        "A judge in Texas is right now deciding whether to dismiss the case against DeLay.",
        "This is basically a money-laundering case, saying he took contributions from corporations that were illegal under Texas law, funneled them through some other organizations to make them acceptable.",
        "If the judge in Texas dismisses that case, then the House Republicans are going to have a tough decision to make, and presumably they will restore him to his post as their leader.",
        "But he has another cloud over his head, and that's from a former associate named Jack Abramoff, a major fund-raiser and lobbyist here in the district.",
        "He's being investigated by federal prosecutors who have already indicted two of his cronies, one of whom is a former DeLay press secretary.",
        "So there's lot of speculation about what that probe may mean for DeLay.",
        "And meanwhile, there's a lot of work to be done.",
        "The House is back at work this negotiating a lot of huge differences that it has with the Senate.",
        "There are key differences on the war; how it should be conducted, how detainees should be treated.",
        "Those are going to have to be worked out between the House and Senate before it goes to the president, who has vowed to veto the bill if that's included, that is if any restriction on his discretion to treat detainees is included.",
        "There are big differences on spending bills.",
        "The House has $50 billion in a package of cuts to Medicaid, college loans, food stamps, programs like that; the Senate doesn't have those cuts.",
        "And there are differences on tax cuts, too.",
        "The Senate wants to focus on the alternative minimum tax, which is mostly paid by people in the, say, $200,000- to $500,000-a-year range, whereas the House has in its package an extension of tax cuts for capital gains and dividends, and those--a little more than half of the benefit of those tax cuts go to the richest 1 percent of Americans, people making $1 million a year or more."

        "So really, the House and Senate have very different approaches to a number of things, as is typically the case, but in this particular year, where the White House usually counts on the House to take its position, it's not going to be able to do that quite as readily because the House has not been as disciplined and organized this fall as it has been in past years.",
        "It's two different cultures that exist in the same building, and they have to pass these laws in identical form.",

        "It started one February morning in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, when Soviet submarine K-129 sank to the bottom of the sea floor, taking with it 98 crew members, three nuclear ballistic missiles and a tempting treasure trove of Soviet secrets.",
        "At the time, 1968, there was no way to get the submarine off the bottom of the ocean.",
        "But over the next six years, a secret CIA mission spent $800 million to get the sub off the bottom of the ocean and to lift it from a depth of more than 3 miles into the hull of a massive custom-built ship.",
        "It sounds like a movie, but it is in fact true.",
        "It's the subject of Josh Dean's book, \"\"The Taking Of K-129: How The CIA Used Howard Hughes To Steal A Russian Sub In The Most Daring Covert Operation In History.\"\" And Josh Dean joined us from our bureau in New York.",

        "I mean, let's start with the fact that they were going to have to pull something off the bottom of the ocean, achieving a feat of engineering far beyond anything that had been attempted in history.",
        "I mean, there had been no salvage of a submarine below 1,000 feet at that point.",
        "NPR's Daniel Zwerdling went to the party, and he joins us now.",
        "Danny, before you tell us what the good news was, I take it that this is an example where food is politics.",

        "Still, many here say they were surprised when the Egyptian partner in the joint venture that operated the pipeline announced it was terminating the contract.",
