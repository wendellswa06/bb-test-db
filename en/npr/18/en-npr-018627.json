        "Yeah.",
        "So it was kind of a problem.",
        "They were, like, well, if we're going to do it, we're going to have to build this ship.",
        "But then how do we explain to people, especially the Soviets, why we are going to have a ship out in the middle of the ocean?",
        "Like, that's just going to seem strange.",
        "So someone came up with the notion of, well, ocean mining is a thing.",
        "So the CIA original task force decided, well, what if we pretended that we were ocean mining?",
        "We'll tell people that this is a mining ship, and we are going to be the first people to mine the ocean.",
        "But there's another part of that, which is we can't be doing it.",
        "The U.S.",
        "government can't do it.",
        "That would obviously be a lie.",
        "We need somebody who plausibly would be mining the ocean, spending a lot of money despite all logic saying that this is not, like, a feasible economic thing.",
        "Who could that be?",
        "What about Howard Hughes, the guy who built a wooden airplane that didn't fly?",
        "Tell people who he is, or was, for people who may not remember.",
        "Right.",
        "So Hughes, at that time, probably the most famous businessman in America, eccentric billionaire, came up in a mining family - so actually, that's one reason this made plausible sense - but then became just sort of bon vivant entrepreneur, aviation.",
        "He made movies.",
        "And by 1968, he was just gigantically famous but also living on the top floor of the desert in a hotel in Las Vegas, you know, hopped up on pills.",
        "And he became a shut-in.",
        "But to the public still, he had these companies.",
        "He had a lot of money.",
        "He had proven track record of doing bananas things that didn't make sense.",
        "So he was so eccentric and so rich and famous that people - oh, yeah, sure.",
        "That could be true.",
        "One of the surprising things that you talk about in the book is the way the CIA handled media requests for information.",
        "So tell me about that.",
        "Well, so when the story ultimately was exposed - it did break in 1975.",
        "A radio reporter named Jack Anderson, very famous journalist of that time, broke the story.",
        "And at that point, the floodgates sort of opened in all of this.",
        "Numerous reporters who had caught wind of it before but were convinced by the CIA director to sit on the story.",
        "He made a convincing appeal that, hey, you could really do damage to national security and quite possibly start a war because if the Soviets find out that we did this, it's a very dangerous thing.",
        "So numerous papers, including The New York Times and Washington Post, agreed to sit on the story in exchange for - he said, I'll give you the full story later.",
        "Once we're finished, then I will tell you everything, but for now, please sit on it.",
        "And they all agreed to do that.",
        "And then this one reporter went rogue and then sort of the floodgates opened.",
        "Well, the CIA's response to that was to never talk about it any - despite the fact that it came out in the media.",
        "They basically - CIA director called those reporters and said, I know you have stories, go ahead and run them, but I will never comment on this again - and all the way up to the president, and for decades would not acknowledge.",
        "It became this, like, total secret.",
        "The words Project Azorian was not declassified until 2011, when the CIA released a partially redacted history.",
        "And I think that had a lot to do with sort of backroom negotiations with the Soviets.",
        "When it was exposed, we told them we won't talk about this in exchange for you not elevating the stakes and actually raising tensions which could harm us all in the end.",
        "And whence comes the famous can neither confirm, nor deny that is something that we've heard quite a bit of.",
        "Call it the Glomar exemption, right.",
        "Because the ship was called the Hughes Glomar Explorer.",
        "The Glomar exemption was the phrase can neither confirm, nor deny, which was a CIA legal answer to the problem of FOIA requests, by denying it on national security grounds would admit that they had built the ship and that its existence was real.",
        "Confirming it they obviously couldn't do, but they also couldn't deny it.",
        "So a lawyer at the CIA said, well, how about we neither confirm, nor deny?",
        "And that actually stood up in court.",
        "It was challenged by a Rolling Stone reporter and the ACLU, I believe.",
        "And it held up in court.",
        "And now, we all deal with that phrase on a daily basis."

        "Why did you feel the need to mention that possibility?",
