        "How a Pruitt EPA responds to some of these issues with California is going to really test Scott Pruitt's and the administration's commitment to conservative values.",
        "As attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt sued the EPA, arguing that his state had the right to set its own environmental rules.",
        "So that logic would seem to imply that California should have the right to set its own agenda.",
        "But we'll see how that trades off against the desire to roll back regulations relating to greenhouse gases.",

        "Things seemed to start out pretty well.",
        "In his first briefing, as you played there, Scaramucci won plaudits for being somewhat of a smooth talker, took questions from everyone and even blew them a kiss."
