        "When I put out a tweet and I put Reince's name in a tweet, they're all making the assumption that it's him because journalists know who the leakers are.",
        "So if Reince wants to explain that he's not a leaker, let him do that.",
        "That would have been big in and of itself, but Scaramucci wasn't done.",
        "It was then revealed he called a New Yorker reporter, tore into Priebus and Bannon in what was really a not-safe-for-work tirade.",
        "(Laughter).",
        "And after the firestorm that created, Scaramucci later tweeted that he would refrain from using such, quote, \"\"colorful language going forward.",
        "OK, so then on Friday, Reince Priebus steps down as chief of staff, and everyone thinks, looks like Scaramucci won.",
        "Right.",

        "What changed between Friday and Monday?",
        "Well, John Kelly, the general, was named Priebus' replacement Friday night as well and apparently took the weekend to think about how he wanted things structure.",

        "...We (laughter) have this turnover.",

        "Remember; Scaramucci said in his first outing in the White House briefing room that he reported directly to the president and not to Reince Priebus.",
        "That looked like it was in conflict with what Kelly wanted and the traditional role as a gatekeeper for the White House chief of staff.",
        "I feel like every two weeks there's this question of, whoa, is this the moment President Trump will begin acting, quote, unquote, \"\"presidential\"\"?",
        "Is there any hope of Chief of Staff Kelly imposing the kind of order on the White House that has been so elusive up until now?",
        "Well, that's the goal for Kelly.",
        "He - what he did today certainly looks like him trying to exert authority and power, which is something that when somebody is in a chaotic situation, they want to show that they are really in charge.",

        "And if you want to get an idea of just how tight this is, one degree, keep in mind that the moon, the full moon, or the sun - but you don't want to look at the sun, but basically the same size - the moon is about a half degree in diameter.",
        "So we're talking about three planets clustered into a very tight little spot in the sky into an area that's roughly about twice the moon's width.",

        "Oh, the best time to look probably be about a half to - a half hour to three-quarters of an hour before the sun comes up, any time over the next few mornings.",
        "But the morning when they'll be closest together will be early on Sunday morning.",
        "So if you're heading back from that late night holiday shopping…",
        "Well, the only drawback about this cluster, it would be more spectacular if we had three - or if all three planets were close to equal brightness.",

        "Mercury won't be quite as bright, but that should also be quite evident.",
        "The only problem planet is Mars.",

        "But it's still kind of interesting that three planets are all, you know, bunched together in such a small spot in the sky.",

        "No.",
        "Jupiter - Jupiter and Mercury, Jupiter especially, should be readily evident as a fairly bright star on the - just above the East-Southeast horizon.",
