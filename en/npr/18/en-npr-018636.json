        "So if you're anywhere from Florida all the way up to southern New England, you'll be able to get a glimpse of the shuttle as it's boring into orbit.",
        "Folks down in the southeastern states will obviously have the best view, because they're closer in.",
        "And especially within 500 miles of Cape Canaveral, you can't miss it because of those brilliant, solid rocket boosters, which bolster the shuttle for the first couple of minutes of powered flight.",
        "But then after the solid rocket boosters are let go or jettisoned, the shuttle continues with the three main engines on the vehicle, and by virtue of those three main engines, you can see it as kind of a pulsating, yellowish-orange, star-like object moving very rapidly across your line of sight.",
        "And the folks generally from the mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states will be able to see that, depending upon where you are, low to the horizon traveling from the south or southeast over to the east.",
        "You should be able to get a good view of that for about a minute or so.",
        "When they shut those main engines down, about eight and a half minutes after launch, that will be about 400 miles southeast of New York City.",
        "So just keep your eye on the sky, low toward the southeastern part of the sky, and you should get at least a glimpse of it, if indeed - whenever NASA gets it off.",
        "Okay, just watch or listen on the radio or TV for the launch and go run outside.",
        "That's absolutely correct.",
        "I mean, don't just assume by the time that you've read the newspaper that the shuttle is going off.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Congress is getting ready to leave town for the Fourth of July recess, but they're moving ahead on immigration first.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "And…",
        "Obviously, last night they didn't.",
        "But as soon as you watch it or listen to it on your local radio station, go outside and, again depending upon where you are, how far up the coast you are - folks like in New England and New York City may have to wait seven or eight minutes after the launch."

        "But further south, closer into the Cape, it may not be quite as long.",
        "Remember that when they shut those main engines off, eight and a half minutes after liftoff, the thing is already moving.",
        "It's like 17,000 miles an hour, so it's going to be moving fairly quick.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Let's talk about the annual winter meteor showers we have.",
        "We had the Leonids last month, but now we have the Geminids.",
        "I love the Geminids.",
        "The Geminids don't get - I wish I could find somebody to be the public relations agent for the Geminid Meteor Shower.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Everybody talks about the Leonids, everybody talks about the August Perseids.",
        "Of course, the Perseids are - come at a time of the year when everybody is out vacationing.",
        "People discover, who never look at the nighttime sky, discover on their own while camping or just looking up on a summer's night meteors coming out of the northeastern part of the sky.",
        "And it's easy to do stargazing in August because it's so mild, and you know, again, a lot of people normally are out and away from bright city lights.",
        "The Geminid Meteor Shower is every bit as good, if not perhaps even better, than the Perseid Meteor Shower.",
        "But the problem with the Geminids, of course, is they come in the middle of December, when it's much, much colder, and it's very tough to, you know, lie out on your back or just even stay out for a long enough time to watch shooting stars.",
        "But if you can bundle up against the cold and are out and about this coming Wednesday night into the wee hours of Thursday morning, when the peak of Geminid shower occurs, you could, if you have a nice, dark area free from any bright lights, see as many as one to two meteors per minute.",
        "We're talking about 60 to maybe as many as 120 per hour.",
        "Wow.",
        "And they're all varying degrees of brightness.",
        "And unlike the Perseids and the Leonids, which zip through our atmosphere at speeds upwards to 40 miles per second, the Geminids move about half as swift.",
        "So unlike the swift, bright streaks that you see with the Leonids, they go - shoop, like that.",
        "The Geminids move slower and more majestically across the sky.",
        "They almost look like the balls that are shot out of a roman candle, and they are very, very spectacular.",
        "The brightest ones, again, move majestically across the sky.",
        "In fact, David Levy, the co-discoverer of the famous Shoemaker-Levy comet, once made the comment about the Geminids.",
        "He said if you have not seen a Geminid fireball arcing majestically across your nighttime sky, you haven't seen a meteor."

        "So if you're out and about the middle or latter part of this week, and if it's clear where you are, especially Wednesday night and Thursday night - those are the two best nights - take a look.",
        "Anytime after 9:00 or 10:00, you certainly should be able to see a few of these bright meteors emanating from the constellation of Gemini, and that's why, of course, we call the Geminid meteors.",
        "Which part of the sky would that be, which direction?",
        "Gemini comes up in the east-northeast along about 7:00, 8:00, 9:00, and by the time you get to 2 a.m., if you can stick it out that long, Gemini will be square overhead.",
        "I mean, how easy is that?",

        "And you've seen the ads in newspapers and catalogues.",

        "She told me what it was, and indeed it was one of the top-of-the-line telescopes.",
        "And I asked the question, I said how old is your grandchild?",
        "And she said he's going to be 7 next month.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And I said wait a minute.",
        "Let's slow down a little bit.",
        "If you're going to purchase a telescope - first of all, if you're purchasing it for a youngster, my suggestion is back up a little bit, and before you go out and buy a telescope, maybe get the child a pair of binoculars."

        "What numbers?",
        "The so-called night classes are seven by 50.",
        "The 7X is the power, seven power.",
        "Fifty is the size and millimeter of the objective lens, the big lenses that you see on the side of the instrument from what you're looking through in the eye piece.",
        "I prefer seven by 35, actually, binoculars, because those kind of binoculars are generally wide-angle, and you get to see a little bit more with wide-angle views.",
        "But they're relatively easy to use.",
        "They're relatively inexpensive.",
        "They're helpful in learning the constellations and getting acquainted with many attractive deep-sky objects.",
        "When held steadily, as I said, you can see the craters on the moon, the crescent of Venus, the moons of Jupiter.",

        "One of the things I know that you've proposed is, well, first fix the outside wall, yes, but in the meantime, erect a new inner wall.",
        "But if the child, if the youngster starts off with binoculars and if he or she sticks with it after a year or two, then you bounce them up to a telescope.",
        "And don't go out and get one of these telescopes that, you know, there's some - I spoke to a lady recently that got a telescope, and she figured that the motorized clock drive was going to help her find everything and anything.",
        "There are telescopes out there that will help you do that, go-to telescopes, where you can program it, but you have to know a little bit about astronomy.",
        "You have to know a little bit about right ascension and declination.",
        "You're not going to go out and buy a whole set of expensive pots and pans and expect immediately to become Emeril Lagasse.",
        "You need to develop a little bit of a knowledge of astronomy and the stars before you go out and buy that big instrument.",

        "Well, you just mentioned the magic word, power.",
        "You have to be wary of power.",
        "One of the things that's always promised is incredibly high power, especially in these department-store telescopes.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, any telescope can provide you with 500-power magnification, but that's well beyond, I should say, the practical maximum magnification of most telescopes.",
        "And what you get when you see 500 power is a big, blurry image.",
        "What you should do is if you know the aperture of the telescope - let's say the telescope is a four-inch telescope - remember the rule 50-power per inch.",
        "So with a four-inch telescope, the maximum you should be using is 200 power.",
        "And generally, you shouldn't even go to the maximum.",
        "You should use half the maximum.",
        "So the best views in a four-inch telescope would be on the order of about 100 power.",
        "And you get a lot of good views with a 100-power telescope.",
        "Another problem is the mounting of the telescope.",
        "A lot of off-the-shelf instruments are usually light-weight and very unstable, and especially like here in the New York metropolitan area last night, where it was very clear but very cold and windy, you bring a telescope out that has a very unstable mount, and you're not going to see anything, regardless of how good the optics are.",
        "So spend some money on a good mount.",
        "You need a telescope, a good-quality telescope with a good optical history and also with a good, solid, sturdy mount.",
        "And before you start thumbing through your local department-store catalogues for such a telescope, I would suggest going down to your local bookstore and picking up a copy of one of the popular journals in astronomy such as Sky and Telescope or maybe a brand-new magazine, which has been out for the last couple of years, called Night Sky Magazine, which is good for the neophyte, the astronomy neophyte, or Astronomy Magazine, which is published out in the Midwest.",
        "Any one of those three magazines will contain a lot of information, usually each month, on how to observe the sky, and also what telescope that you can get, and a lot of advertisements of reputable firms.",
        "Or join a club or go online where there are telescope clubs and talk to people about that.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There's always a telescope astronomy club in most of the larger cities.",
        "And I'm sure that if you, you know, went to Google and googled astronomy clubs and tagged on what city you happen to be located in, you after a small search will probably find some planetarium, observatory or astronomy club near to you with people who are interested in the sky and can actually help you out."
