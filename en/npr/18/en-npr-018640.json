        "We had located a person that was not able to move his lower extremities, was clinging to a portion of his roof, which was in the water, basically some shingles, and had a red handkerchief in his hand, barely waving it, so we were able to lower the rescue swimmer down between some trees, and he was able to traverse on this partially submerged wood object and grab the survivor, bring him into the helicopter, and we immediately transported him to a hospital.",
        "Those rescues are taking place every minute.",
        "We've got rescue swimmers that are landing on top of rooftops with crash axes and busting their way through roofs, trying to access people where there's no second-story windows, and they need assistance.",
        "I know you're busy.",
        "We're going to let you go.",
        "But I did want to ask you, what's your impression of what it looks like?",
        "Lt.",

        "TOBIAS: Well, the damage is extensive.",
        "It's--there's--it's just--you can't imagine, you know, a storm of that caliber, does--and it doesn't look good out there, but we're doing everything possible to get out to those people in need and bring them to safety.",

        "He's been planning and studying disaster scenarios for the city and had predicted a scenario not too dissimilar from what has just happened.",

        "Good of you to be with us today.",
        "Well, thank you.",

        "Are waters right now still rising in New Orleans?",
        "As I understand it, there's two breaches.",
        "On the northern side of the city, the water is still coming in, but on the southern side, which is called the Industrial Canal area, water appears to be coming out of the flooded city areas and coming into the canal, so it's actually helping to relieve the flooding.",
        "So in some places, good news, and in some places, less good news.",
        "Now obviously, can you explain the difficulties of trying to fix these levees?",
        "He was asking about wildlife, you know, reptiles, venomous snakes, that sort of thing.",
        "Slidell is a town that some have described as being almost wiped off the map.",
        "Well, once the water breaches a levee, it itself creates a very unstable situation with a very high velocity of the flow of the water.",
        "So anything you try to do while the water's flowing is immediately subject to some very large forces, so unfortunately, once an opening occurs, it's very, very difficult to try to put anything in there to resist those forces.",
        "And I know they've been dropping those gigantic 3,000-pound sandbags and talking about other kinds of obstructions to drop in there.",
        "Nothing yet has done much good.",

        "We left New Orleans at 2 PM on Sunday, which was the very last minute to leave.",
        "We're fortunate, and thank God that we left when we did.",
        "Because it took us five hours to get to Slidell, Louisiana, which is 25 miles away, of course, from the city, and the traffic was flowing in an orderly fashion.",

        "We could feel the storm.",

        "And the thing that frightened me the most was we could hear the local radio and they were saying on the local radio, `Get out now, get out while you can.",
        "And I called the radio station, and I said, `Don't tell anyone to leave the city now.",

        "Food that has rested for some time at more than 40 degrees could be unsafe.",

        "He's an oceanographer and expert on emergency preparedness for the city of New Orleans, and he'd been working out disaster scenarios for the city, not unlike that which unfolded over the past couple of days.",
        "And, Mr. Suhayda, there needs to be a long-term fix for the city of New Orleans.",
        "Even if they're fixed, these current levees are just not adequate, are they?",
        "Well, I agree with you, there needs to be a long-term re-examination of the whole situation.",
        "The levee protection was only known to provide protection up to a certain level of protection.",
        "I think that has to be re-examined.",
        "And obviously, there's some interior properties of the city with these very low-lying areas, the bowl, as we've described it--they need to be addressed.",
        "Obviously, we don't want to re-create the vulnerability that led to the problems that we have today.",
        "Marc, are you there?",
        "Well, that's what we're proposing as an alternative or, let's say, internal plan; that is it takes generations, decades to complete these big levee projects.",
        "Let's do some interior drainage management to minimize the problem that can be accomplished within a year, so that we'll have some kind of management or mitigation of the problem until the big project kicks in.",
        "Because obviously, there's going to be a problem if another hurricane hits next month or even next year."
