        "Well, that's the problem is--you know, I think there is a sense on some people that, well, now we've had the worst case and, of course, we'll recover from it, but, in fact, September's the worst month for hurricanes on the northern Gulf Coast, and next year, we could face a worse storm.",
        "So this is an ongoing issue that the state and the country has to face.",

        "Hello.",
        "Jeffrey, you're on the air.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Yes.",
        "Good afternoon.",
        "And I was wondering if there will be any accountability and in regards to why those levees were only ready for Level 3.",
        "Here in south Florida, we place a lot of trust in our public officials, and should we be reconsidering that situation?",
        "Listen to what these people tell us, and I could see from the news--all the news, all cable channels here, that a lot of those residents were let down.",
        "They're the ones that have the property that's destroyed.",
        "We're not talking commercial.",
        "We're talking residential.",
        "I'm an architecture student, and I know that there's many ways around building these things and maybe incentives that could be given to construction companies to build these things and be fortified.",
        "Well, my response, Jeffrey, is I think you're right on.",
        "I think this is an issue that starts with the people who are committing themselves to live and work and raise their families in these areas, and I think the impetus for action on the part of our governmental people will be reflective of the seriousness and the depth of the dedication of the public, so my feeling is now is the time to let people know, the public officials know from the people in New Orleans that we can't go back to business as usual, that there's going to be no chance of having this repeat again.",
        "`Never again' I think would be a phrase that would guide the whole recovery effort.",
        "We hope so, sir.",
        "We wish all the people in Louisiana very much luck.",

        "Hi.",
        "Hi.",
        "I was wondering if your guest could enlighten me.",
        "I'm not familiar with the facts on the ground there.",
        "It would seem to me they were trying to plug the breach and it would be easier to plug the canal that feeds the breach because you know the shape of the canal and you also have more manageable water velocities.",
        "You're right.",
        "There was a option for plugging the canal.",
        "The last time I saw some aerial photos or some aerial video was that the face of the bridge that really terminates the canal was cluttered with debris, so there'd be a substantial amount of effort to just clear that area before you could get in to then try to do something.",
        "And, of course, while you're clearing it, you're not plugging the hole, and, in fact, you're actually opening up the flow of water a little bit.",
        "So it's, unfortunately, a real complicated win, you know, and lose situation.",
        "Dennis, thanks for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And before we let you go, Mr. Suhayda, can you tell us, has the water risen to the level where it threatens the freshwater supply in New Orleans and what about the pumps?",
        "Are they going to be still working when the levees are shut, and do you try to pump the water out?",
        "Well, there's two issues there.",
        "I think the freshwater supply was compromised early on; that is, there was a break of a water main supply so that the freshwater was already contaminated, and there are problems with sewage and all the rest of that.",
        "The second part of this is, we have to stop the flow of the water into the city, close that off.",
        "Then the pumps can slowly try to remove (technical difficulties).",
        "They cannot keep up with the amount of water coming in.",

        "It's a good thing, though, I mean, in terms of the evacuation, that, you know, some people were concerned about a major outbreak or some kind of a major illness developing, but it's my understanding now that starting Wednesday, most of the people will begin to be evacuated or the 40-odd-thousand left.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And some people say as many as 80,000.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I understand your house was 30 years old and sits right on the water.",
        "I assume you've had flooding before.",
        "No.",
        "No, it was the first time in that entire neighborhood.",
        "Well, yeah, that's correct.",
        "And, of course, for those that remain behind over the next few days, it's really critical, because it's so hot and that water's warm, so decomposition processes go on and the chance for fecal contamination is high, so I think that in the sense of toxic, there's more a bacterial problem than anything else."
