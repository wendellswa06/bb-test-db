        "...welcome.",
        "Hello?",
        "Mr. La Point?",
        "Yes, I'm here.",
        "Yes, hi.",
        "This one has turned out to be as big as anybody ever--as any storm anybody's ever seen in that part of the country.",
        "It certainly seems to be that.",
        "A major developing catastrophe.",
        "I mean, until they get the pumps going to pump the water out, and then in addition, the water that's coming in from Lake Pontchartrain with the potential to have some industrial chemicals as part of that still--all I can say is that it's really wonderful that those people are getting out, now being--and the mandatory evacuation going on.",
        "Because as soon as people are out of there, the better it'll be.",
        "Eventually, when they do finally pump the water out, there's going to be an awful lot of terrible stuff left behind, no?",
        "Well, yes, and that's one of the issues, is that I'm sure no one yet has a handle on in the sense of where these sedi--anytime water moves, it carries with it suspended sediments.",
        "That's particles in the water, coming up from the muds and the soils that were in the area.",
        "But think about this in terms of all the homes and all the chemicals that are carried in people's garages even, and all these things will be corroding over the time.",
        "The cans will be, and so there's going to be some real possibilities of some contaminated soils and muck that will need to be cleaned out before people are allowed in.",
        "And in my way of thinking, that's one of the issues that'll probably be a very difficult issue to solve anytime within a month or two, certainly.",
        "Well, I'm told that the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, says now it'll be at least two or three months before New Orleans has electricity, and during that time, he says, there will be no commerce in the city.",
        "We've also heard that people who have been evacuated from the city, 12, 16 weeks, and, again, that's three or four months before they can anticipate being able to return home.",
        "This is going to be quite some operation.",
        "I don't think anyone yet really has a--can get their minds around just the enormity of the situation.",
        "You're right.",
        "We're talking with Thomas La Point, an aquatic toxicologist and director of the Institute of Applied Sciences at the University of North Texas, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News."

        "This is Mike, Mike calling us from Pennsylvania.",
        "Yes.",
        "Hi.",
        "I have a question in regards to--since most of the water coming in that's flooding the city is coming in from Lake Pontchartrain, that would be freshwater.",
        "How does that differ from initial assessments that the storm surge would come over the levees and the city would get flooded with saltwater?",
        "Well, I think, again, I'm taking a bit of a guess on here, but the lake water is fresh, but it's also--in some areas towards the south it's brackish, certainly tidal--influenced by the tides.",
        "And so where most of the water in Lake Pontchartrain is freshwater, there's the potential there of getting some brackish water; not really saltwater--it's not as salty as what you might find in the Gulf--but still water that's of sufficient salt content that it would be not potable, not drinkable.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, you know, that's been carried on a couple of the newscasts and such, and although I wouldn't want to minimize the danger to people of being bitten by a water moccasin, I think the real risk for the people remaining over the next few days to a week in New Orleans is more from bacterial infection and then the diarrheal diseases that could start if they were to drink some of that contaminated water.",
        "I think the wildlife issue, whereas it is real, just the actual probability of meeting one of these creatures is pretty small in the whole area, so I'm not sure that's a problem.",
        "Now in terms of what's happening to the wildlife, I don't think anyone has a clue yet.",
        "Mike, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Have a great day.",

        "And we have our own generators that are powering air conditioning and life-support systems right now.",
        "So we're surviving and taking care of our patients, but it's a tenuous situation, with both the water and the electrical.",
        "And are you accepting new patients?",
        "We are taking new patients.",
        "We are--patients or individuals who need resources such as dialysis or oxygen, things like that, we're trying to get those to FEMA installations, but patients who have acute emergency--we are taking those patients and managing those emergencies as I speak.",

        "But we have capacity in the ED, and we're--in the next few days we're seeing things like we were seeing for the last few days, which is dehydration, heat exposure and a lot of patients with chronic medical illnesses who--with no access to medication.",
