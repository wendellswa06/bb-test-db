        "When did you decide to leave?",
        "Well, I'll tell you, we will definitely--if we stay in the area, we will definitely never, never stay again.",
        "It was quite scary.",
        "You know, we rode through the storm just fine.",
        "We had a big generator, and so we were actually quite comfortable and watching the chaos outside, but then that ended and the water came up so fast.",
        "It was so scary and we were, you know, banking on plan number two, which was to get up into an attic and, of course, you know, bring an ax with us so we could, you know, chop our way through the top in case we had to be on the rooftop.",
        "But luckily, it subsided and started to go down pretty fast, and we were sort of stuck in the back of a big subdivision.",
        "And my daughter's fiance was Paul Bunyan, and for two miles he cut trees and went through power lines to get us out of that subdivision.",
        "And it also created a pathway for other people that had stayed behind, so they could get out as well.",
        "So, you know, at that point, when we could exit and when, you know, he chopped through all the trees, then, you know, we were able to get out.",
        "Now you and your husband own two Quiznos stores there in Slidell.",
        "Correct.",
        "What happened to them?",
        "They went under as well.",
        "We lost a vacation home and our primary home and two businesses.",
        "And what's going to happen?",
        "Do you have any idea?",
        "You know, it's--there are just, you know, so many emotions and just trying to deal, you know, with the loss; however, being very happy that, you know, my family, you know, made it through, particularly with us staying which, you know, of course, was a very foolish move.",
        "But, you know, to even think about the economic--you know, revitalizing our town economically, and New Orleans as well and the rest of the Gulf Coast, I just--I can't even imagine how that's going to happen.",
        "And, you know, like I said, it's enough dealing with, you know, the loss of our home and everything, but now, also, our businesses.",
        "And, obviously, there are--you know, those businesses support a lot of employees who make their livings there.",
        "This just ripples out farther and farther.",
        "Sure, it does.",
        "And each day we find another ripple or another couple of ripples, you know, that we really hadn't thought about or counted on.",
        "And we've heard from a couple of our employees.",
        "You know, it's so difficult because all of us, you know, from Slidell--the information has been very slow in coming; very frustrating.",
        "And just yesterday we started, you know, receiving information.",
        "Of course, I took it as a very bad sign that they weren't even reporting on the area, but, you know, all of us have friends.",
        "Some of them stayed.",
        "And, you know, I fear it'll be weeks, you know, before we can all get in touch with each other, you know, to make sure everyone's OK."

        "I saw an interview with the mayor of Slidell earlier today, and he said he didn't know where his wife and children were.",
        "I saw that as well, and I'll tell you, it was nice to see a familiar face on the news this morning.",
        "I was very glad that he did that press conference.",
        "But yeah, I mean, you know, our cell phones don't work.",
        "The communication has probably been one of the most difficult to deal with, you know, because of that fact, because you don't know where your family members are, you can't get in touch with anyone; you can't even make, you know, those needed calls to FEMA, you know, to start your claim because, of course, you know, that's a huge process that all of us now have to go through, and I'm sure that they are just, you know, inundated.",
        "But, you know, without communications, you can't do any of those things.",
        "You have two daughters, as I understand it, who attend local universities.",
        "What's happened to them?",

        "She's a junior at the University of New Orleans, and the University of New Orleans sits right on Lake Pontchartrain.",
        "So, you know, obviously, there have been no news reports.",
        "No one has addressed the condition of the university.",
        "But, you know, we have to assume that it's pretty bad.",
        "And so, you know, she's worried about, you know, how is she going to graduate, you know?",
        "What's--you know, what is going to befall all the credits that she's received?",
        "And, again, it's just a little frustrating because no one has addressed it at all.",
        "And so, you know, I mean, thousands of students, also, at Loyola and Tulane--you know, they've all started class already and, you know, they don't know where to go, where to turn.",

        "You know, all the servers, I guess, are down.",
        "And so that's been really difficult.",
        "My youngest one just started at LSU here in Baton Rouge, and she, you know, of course, now is missing a lot of class because they're not going to take back in until September 6th because they have to actually use the university, I guess, for, you know, medical triage.",
        "So, you know, it's kind of been, you know, odd for her, you know, because she hasn't been able to start school like, you know, she really should have and have the excitement of, you know, her first semester.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "We wish you the best of luck.",
        "It's going to be a long haul.",
        "Yes, it is, and thank you so much.",
