        "We don't have it.",
        "It doesn't look like we're going to get it.",
        "Well, let's hope that report is accurate.",
        "We've not heard that here, so we can't confirm it, but let's hope that it's true.",

        "Yeah.",

        "I mean, we've literally--our friends have used pirogues and kayaks so far already to get out of the--friends that have houses and stuff.",
        "I have no plans on going anywhere.",
        "I'll tell you, the scary thing is we both parked our cars in a big, huge parking lot on Canal Street, where there was a lot of looting yesterday, and it was so bad the police just had to let it go.",
        "We're scared to go get the cars, for one thing, because it's in a parking lot with no supervision, and I understand there's been carjackings; there's been some shootings around the city.",
        "It's not widespread; I have not seen any myself, but I've heard some--a few terrible accounts.",
        "Last night they--one supermarket, they opened it up.",
        "They made--because, I guess, people started looting.",
        "They just opened up and let people take what they wanted, you know?",
        "I saw people walking out of there, literally, with 80 bottles of wine and food and just truckloads full of stuff.",
        "And that night, you know, there was some of--we were in another section of the city.",
        "It was dry, too, but there were some areas where, like, some guy walked up and tried to take ice as we were using a pay phone, which was working, miraculously, and as soon as he started banging on the lock to get the ice out, about three guys walked up with machine guns and flashlights and started screaming, `Martial law,' and sent him on his way.",
        "So there's a lot of that and it's a bit scary, you know?",
        "Everyone's trying to protect their property and nip looting in the bud before it starts.",
        "Mm-hmm, obviously, but as you're suggesting, in some areas, it may be too late for that.",

        "I have two brothers and I can't contact them and I'm trying to find them.",
        "The only advice that we've gotten--and yours is not the first call like this, I'm terribly afraid, Kathleen--is to check with the Red Cross.",
        "And, obviously, just driving around is extremely difficult and communications, as you know, are impossible.",
        "Right.",

        "Yeah.",

        "What are the national security implications of that?",
        "Well, I mean the national security implications of a adversary foreign power having serious compromising information that is nonpublic on a president of the United States are vast for the simple reason that the president knows that this information exists and is therefore fearful that the information will emerge.",
        "That will influence his maneuverability with respect to dealing with that foreign power."
