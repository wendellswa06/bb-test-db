        "Yeah, and what's good about this is that Patrick Stewart kind of throws himself into every scene he's in.",

        "We have this guy who drinks too much, he does drugs, he has these public scandals and he has to talk about it all with his psychologist, who's played by Richard Lewis.",

        "OK.",
        "I mean, it's kind of a weird choice for a show that's supposed to be a contemporary comedy about celebrity culture in the news business.",
        "So that gives you a hint of some of the problems they have with it.",
        "Oh, problems.",
        "OK, Eric, it sounds like you're not exactly a big fan of this show.",
        "What's going on?",
        "Well, this show is ultimately a collection of a bunch of scattered jokes that don't really add up to, like, a larger idea.",
        "I mean, you want this program to say some insightful stuff about the news business or the nature of celebrity or the absurdity of modern life, but you're mostly following around this self-centered, eccentric, self-destructive, cable TV guy who seems sort of vaguely modeled after Piers Morgan, the former CNN host.",
        "So in an odd way, it's kind of less than the sum of its parts.",
        "All right, Eric, but Starz is trying to compete in a very, very crowded marketplace right now, right?",

        "Well, you're right.",
        "The marketplace is crowded.",
        "I mean, this year, we're going to have something like 400 TV series, right?",
        "So, in an environment like that, Starz - this channel that asked people to pay an extra fee to access what they do - they really have to deliver exceptional programming, and not too many of Starz's shows have been that great.",
        "Now this channel, they've been around since 1994.",
        "They've got sister channels like Encore and MoviePlex, something like 30 million subscribers.",
        "And you may remember some shows that they've had like a version of \"\"Spartacus.\"\" They have an urban drama called \"\"Power,\"\" and they have this romantic drama about a time traveling World War II nurse called \"\"Outlander.\"\" But even though \"\"Power\"\" and \"\"Outlander\"\" have connected with strong fan bases, they still don't have that visibility of shows on rivals like HBO and Showtime.",
        "OK, so it sounds like basically they need a hit.",

        "Well, to put it another way, they need a hit show that defines the channel's brand for the world, especially the audience.",
        "They've had these shows that are good, but they just don't land in the zeitgeist and talk about issues that are at the center of pop culture and how we talk about life.",
        "They've got a show called \"\"Power,\"\" for example, that's a great urban drama, but it's overshadowed by Fox's drama, \"\"Empire,\"\" because \"\"Power\"\" doesn't really say a lot about race or urban life in the way that \"\"Empire\"\" does.",

Evil Dead.\"\" But so far, series like \"\"Blunt Talk,\"\" they're just not there yet.",

        "This is the 1,200-mile pipeline stretching from western Canada all the way to the Gulf Coast that has yet to be finished.",
        "Most Democrats don't want a vote on Keystone.",
        "So, how does Reid find a way out?",
        "Avoid a Senate vote on the pipeline and blame Republicans for it.",
        "Look at how Republican obstruction is bringing the Senate to its knees, again and again and again.",
        "And now even on this bill - a bipartisan bill.",
        "The bill Reid is actually talking about here is one that would help increase energy efficiency in federal buildings and private homes.",
        "For days, Reid has said, only after that bill passes would he then allow a stand-alone vote on Keystone.",
        "He then blocked the other side from introducing amendments to change the bill, which made many Republicans - like John McCain of Arizona - vow they'd, in turn, block the energy efficiency bill.",
        "The dictator won't allow us to have any amendments.",
        "I mean, it is just unprecedented.",
        "I've been around here a long, long time.",
        "And that's the procedural dance that let Senate Democrats avert a Keystone vote this time around."
