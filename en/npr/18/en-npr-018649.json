        "Before Hoffmann gets into what, as you say, amounts like a play-by-play of the symphony, he wrote this: Music reveals an unknown kingdom to mankind, a world that has nothing in common with the outward, material world that surrounds it, and in which we leave behind all predetermined conceptual feelings in order to give ourselves up to the inexpressible.",

        "Whereas in the ballet, it's a harmless diversion that is full of sort of dancing and merriment, but there's nothing profound in the ending of the ballet as it exists.",
        "And it's also true of Dumas' story - ends in a very fluffy, saccharine way",
        "Whereas Hoffmann wanted to make sure that Marie is shown to be aware of the fact that there is a contrast between the reality in which she is living and the world to which she's going, which is a world of her imagination, a world of her choice, where she can also make decisions that are more in accord with her own imagination and more in accord with her own creativity.",
        "Reading the Hoffmann story of \"\"The Nutcracker and the Mouse King\"\" and thinking of the ballet, it reminded me of \"\"The Wizard of Oz\"\" actually, in which a young girl has what she thinks is a real experience, but actually she's been dreaming and she's been delirious and in the end, the message is there's no place like home.",
