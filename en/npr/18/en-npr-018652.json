        "What kind of support ships?",
        "Mary Louise, the number of ships that would accompany an aircraft carrier on a mission, in this case an exercise, one, it's classified.",
        "But, two, it would vary depending upon the threat.",
        "So somewhere between six and 10 ships would be normal, and there's certainly somewhere between eight and 10,000 sailors and other troops involved in this exercise.",
        "Okay.",
        "So, what all of these ships and all of these sailors get out there this weekend, what actually happens out there?",
        "Does that mean that there is a scenario in place, a fictional scenario and they're enacting what a response would look like?",
        "Are they actually firing?",
        "How does it work?",
        "Mary Louise, that's - your first comment is exactly correct.",
        "Assuming that airpower would be applied in a military response to some provocation - I'm making that assumption.",
        "One, the pilots have to be briefed on potential targets and they've got to fly missions whose profiles would approximate the kind of missions that they would be flying, certainly not over North Korea, but over simulated target areas in and around the west sea or even potentially in South Korea itself"

        "In this corner of the world, how often would exercises on this scale be undertaken?",
        "When things aren't normal, you would expect these kind of exercises a couple times a year at a minimum.",
        "That could go up if tensions were high and it was necessary to be more ready and could be down if rapprochement is on the table and if everyone is acting sensibly.",
        "That's interesting that you say the number of exercises goes up as tensions rise.",
        "I mean, North Korea, as I'm sure you've seen, has called this a provocation to conduct this type of exercise at this particular point in time.",
        "Do they have a point?",
        "I don't think they have a point at all.",
        "This is a standard ploy of the North Koreans to threaten military engagement, in fact conduct provocations as we've seen both here recently with the attack on the island and also the sinking of the Cheonan back in March, where they are trying to drive the United States to the negotiating table.",
        "So it is necessary for the allied forces, principally South Korea and the United States, to be ready in case North Korea makes a major mistake and conducts a serious advancement of forces across the DMZ or at sea.",
        "And so, when you see increased provocations by the North, you would expect military commanders to call for and conduct increased readiness exercises to ratchet up their readiness.",
        "But do it in a way that's announced and done in a way that the North Koreans cannot mistake it for a provocative act.",
