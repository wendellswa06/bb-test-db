        "The president plainly has bent over backwards to try to cooperate with them, and still wants to.",
        "And I think that's the right position.",
        "He plainly is not willing to give up some things he believes in, and I think that's the right position.",

        "President, thanks for your time.",

        "It's very interesting to see this coalition come together at the last minute.",
        "And Bart Stupak said this puts them well beyond the 216 votes that they need, that Democrats need to pass this bill tonight.",

        "Just moments ago, we saw almost a Conga line, they call it, on the House floor of members coming down to the mic, Republicans, say, asking for a few days to revise and extend their remarks.",
        "It's just a normal procedure, but when 200 members get up and do it over and over again, taking 10 seconds each, it really delays the proceedings, and so that's what we're watching now.",
        "And so can we expect more of that this evening?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think we should expect both sides to do everything in their power to get what they want.",
        "I mean, there's no question but that this is absolutely history in the making, whether it passes or fails, and both sides are there in the moment trying to do what they think is right.",
