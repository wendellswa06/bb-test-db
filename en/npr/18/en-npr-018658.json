        "After 1998, after the big floods in Yangtze River basin, the national government imposed a big program of natural forest protection in the purpose of soil conservation.",

        "When he was in the House leadership under Speaker Newt Gingrich, Boehner was the Republicans' liaison between the lobbying community and the party.",

        "And in 2002, Blunt, or someone in his office, tried to surreptitiously insert a provision into a homeland security bill that would have protected tobacco companies from online cigarette sales.",

        "And by the looks of it, that might not change if Blunt and Boehner are the only two candidates for majority leader.",
