        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Delighted to be here.",
        "I'm probably old enough remember when that was built in 1962 so...",
        "Yeah, it was highly publicized.",
        "Its image got all over the world.",
        "And how - it has a unique design to it.",
        "Who designed it and why does it have the shape it has?",
        "That's a really interesting question.",
        "There's - it's actually a complicated story.",
        "The chief architect was a man named John Graham Jr., had a large architectural firm.",
        "He was mainly known as the man who invented the first really successful shopping mall, which was here in Seattle, Northgate.",
        "He had the task of creating the Space Needle.",
        "But he - they got stuck on the design.",
        "They had a doodle on a napkin.",
        "He had a bunch of architects who began looking at a tower-like structure.",
        "They were inspired by a tower, a broadcast tower in Germany, in Stuttgart, which had a restaurant on it.",
        "And so they knew they wanted an observation deck.",
        "But they were kind of open to what else they would do.",
        "They thought about putting a planetarium up there and a helicopter pad.",
        "No kidding.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They considered all kinds of things.",
        "And - but they were stuck on coming up with a design that was really a wow design.",
        "So John Graham hired as a consultant a professor from the University of Washington named Victor Steinbrueck.",
        "He's known locally in Seattle as architect-activist who saved the Pike Place Market.",
        "But he was a designer, and he worked on the Space Needle design.",
        "He got stuck.",
        "And one day, he was sitting in his home office and he saw - he had a beautiful abstract sculpture by a California artist named David Lemon, and it was feminine figure in complete abstract, reaching up to the sky with this narrow waist and then this tripod legs.",
        "And it was called \"\"The Feminine One.\"\" And he went, aha, OK, there is a unique shape for a tower.",
        "Wow.",
        "If you have a question you want to ask Knute, get up there on our microphones and you can ask it.",
        "Where there any engineering innovations that were required to get this to be built?",

        "Yeah, John Graham was actually building a revolving bar in Honolulu, and they thought, well, let's since they had - Graham wanted a flying saucer shape.",
        "And, of course, Washington state had kicked off the whole flying saucer craze with the sighting at Mt.",
        "Rainier in 1947 that the press had called flying saucer.",
        "But it became this kind of iconic idea of what the future would look like.",
        "Well, because it was this circular shape, a revolving restaurant made sense.",
        "Graham patented a gearing system that allowed you to turn the entire restaurant of 250 people with a one-horsepower motor.",
        "Wow.",
        "And that was built up in Everett, Washington, just north of Seattle.",
        "With a size that drives a washing machine.",
        "It's very small.",
        "Yes, exactly.",
        "Very small motor.",
        "Exactly.",
        "They have - the motor in there now is a little bigger, but it only takes one horsepower to turn it.",
        "And depending on which side you're on, you may not want consensus."

        "Yeah.",

        "You could sit down.",
        "You could make a call.",

        "Yeah.",
