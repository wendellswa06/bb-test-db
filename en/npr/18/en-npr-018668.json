        "He says some corn growers could live with lower direct payments, but that it's a complex issue, difficult to change.",
        "It's something that I think takes time and sometimes these changes have to be incremental.",
        "And I think this is a bill that probably is in some people's minds not enough.",
        "But it is incremental movement and I think from that standpoint, I think that's positive.",
        "But opponents say the measure should be rejected because it cuts international food aid and overall lacks substantive reform.",
        "Ken Cook says the farm bill is a missed opportunity.",
        "It is very disappointing that this Congress in this farm economy with the leadership we now have basically blinked.",

        "Mistrust certainly didn't start with the current administration, but it has gotten far worse since Barack Obama won the White House.",
        "NPR's Mara Liasson reports on what this has cost President Obama, and how he hopes to change it.",

        "A president who wants to use government to solve problems when a public says, we don't trust the government, we want less government, is a problem.",
        "For example, in Kohut's poll, 84 percent of those opposed to the president's new health care law said the reason was too much government.",

        "He says the continued loss of trust in government over the past year is striking, given the wave of trust, at least personal trust, that swept Barack Obama into office.",
        "I think the president assumed that the confidence that the American people had invested in him as a leader would somehow spill over to his party and to the instruments of government as a whole.",
        "And if that's what he assumed, he was wrong from the start.",
        "The American people had not suspended their mistrust of government.",
        "For example, candidate Obama issued a large promissory note about an end to partisan bickering and a return to something closer to civility in the relations between the political parties.",
        "And when he wasn't able to redeem that promise, attitudes towards government got even more negative.",
