        "There can be few places – we'll get calls complaining about Florida, and Arizona and Nevada, but there are a few places where housing prices had plummeted as much as California, and that sense that people had of that huge investment in a home that they could always rely on, maybe even retire on, that has really changed.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "You know, it's - you get the sense from talking to people, a lot, that they are in shock because, literally and figuratively, the rug has been pulled out from under them, and they're standing, they're going, what just happened?",

        "I was over extended, but did I really deserve to be out on the street like this where I'm trying to fit, you know, me, my family and three kids in a two-bedroom apartment when we used to have 3,000 square feet?",

        "Last year for Christmas, we sent out a post card to all our family and friends, letting them know we would not be giving gifts because my husband's employer had gone out of business.",
        "We also asked no one give us gifts because it wasn't fair.",
        "We'd feel even more guilty.",
        "Well, thanks to our savings and unemployment, we were able to make it through nine months of unemployment.",

        "Of course, that, in part, because fewer people are out there actually looking for work.",
        "And we'd like to thank Richard Gonzales out of KQED and our national correspondent there and our national correspondent Debbie Elliott from her base in Orange Beach in Alabama, for telling us stories of hard times.",
