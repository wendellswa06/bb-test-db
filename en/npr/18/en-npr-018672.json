        "And Glenn, is that a substantial change from what presidents have said before?",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "I mean, in the context of diplomacy, what President Obama said that was different was that he actually referenced 1967, the 1967 lines, the de-facto border that had basically existed since the end of the 1948 war of independence.",
        "So if he had said the armistice lines of 1948, would that have been different?",
        "No, what I did is I researched and looked at what all previous presidents had said, and actually they never said anything about lines one way or the other.",
        "I mean, they danced around it.",
        "Even Bill Clinton, when he was in the midst of negotiations with the Palestinians and the Israelis and thought he was very close to a deal never actually spoke about the lines because it's a bit of a -and again, like I said, it's in the context of diplomacy.",
        "Everyone knows that if you have a peace agreement that's going to involve peace for security, when Ehud Olmert was negotiating pretty seriously with the Palestinians, it was off the 1967 lines, and it was, you know, I'll give you -you can have those settlements, and I can take that piece of land.",
        "But by putting it right there in that speech - and the context is also important in that the administration had been trying to get Netanyahu for weeks to actually say '67 lines, and he never did.",
        "So the president decided to go out and say it himself, which if you were Bibi Netanyahu sitting there in Israel, you would say: Oh, this is his shot at me.",
        "He just - and so then Netanyahu stuck it to him.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And this is - when he met with the president at the White House, there was a news conference after the meeting that was described generally as frosty, but that was the private meeting, and Netanyahu came out to talk with reporters afterwards."

        "While Israel is prepared to make generous compromises for peace, it cannot go back to the 1967 lines because these lines are indefensible.",
        "And he's referring again to the 1967 lines.",
        "And if you go back to those lines, well, yeah, at one point, Israel has a very small waist, very narrow parts.",
        "But he deliberately excluded the lines with mutually agreed land swaps.",
        "Exactly, exactly, and it kind of twisted around what the president had said.",
        "And the president a few days later expanded on what he had said and tried to explain what he meant.",
        "I mean, the one thing that was a little disingenuous on the part of Netanyahu is he calls them indefensible lines.",
        "Let's remember what happened in 1967.",
        "Israel actually defended itself pretty well from those lines against armies on all sides, and that's one reason why we're in the situation we are now because they conquered a fair amount of territory from the Arabs.",
        "And the other point is that, you know, those lines and the effort to build settlements were intended to, you know, defend against large-scale Arab armies invading again.",
        "But actually Israel has a peace agreement with Egypt, it has a peace agreement with Jordan, it controls the Golan Heights, which it has annexed, which makes it very difficult for Syria to attack.",
        "And so what you have is a situation where the problem is from highly sophisticated rockets and that sort of thing, which it wouldn't really matter if your lines are nine miles or 30 miles.",
        "The modern technology has made all that moot.",
        "Well, there's other problems with settlements in areas where the Israeli settlers want to stay, and they are an important part of the prime minister's coalition, in fact.",
        "And so he has political problems of his own.",
        "Oh, exactly.",
        "And you've got to look at a lot of what was happening here in terms of domestic politics.",
        "Because there is - as you mentioned, his immediate predecessor, Ehud Olmert, said in a widely reported speech, I'm reading here from a column that Fareed Zakaria published in your paper this morning, a speech to the Israeli Knesset in 2008, not all that long ago.",
        "We must give up Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem and return to the core of the territory that is the state of Israel prior to 1967 with minor corrections dictated by the reality created since then."

        "Reality created since then, he's referring to settlements.",

        "That's right.",

        "It's a little different when a U.S.",
        "president says it in a way that President Obama said it.",
        "And not to get too much into the diplomatic weeds, there were other things that normally presidents had said at the same time when talking about these boundaries or the code for these boundaries, which President Obama didn't say.",
        "So you have to look at it not just at that one sentence but the total package of what the president was saying.",
        "For instance, he made no reference to - or he said he would defer to later on the question of what happens to the rights of Palestinians to settle back in Israel, which is very important for the Palestinians.",
        "It's a complete non-starter for the Israelis.",
        "And so when President Obama didn't put that to the side or didn't put it in the same context, it got - that raised hackles in Israel because that was different from what other presidents had said.",
        "Well, and again, we're going to bring in another voice in just a moment, but again, the president did not mention that issue of the right of return for Palestinians.",
        "And this again from the White House news conference, where Prime Minister Netanyahu seemed to, well, address the point the president had failed to address.",
        "And I think it's time to tell the Palestinians forthrightly it's not going to happen.",
        "The Palestinian refugee problem has to be resolved.",
        "It can be resolved, and it will be resolved.",
        "If the Palestinians choose to do so in a Palestinian state, that's a real possibility, but it's not going to be resolved within the Jewish state.",

        "Nice to have you with us today."

        "Pleasure, Neal.",
        "And as you listen to that, that was received with, well, one way in Israel, one way in Jerusalem and another way in Ramallah.",
        "I think that's fair although to be honest, Jerusalem is such a fractured polity that - I mean, on the issue of refugees, per se, you're right, there's near unanimity among Israelis that there cannot be a right of Palestinian return to what is today Israel.",
        "And you're also right that in Ramallah and in the West Bank, generally among Palestinians, it's considered a central right that mustn't be given up, at least not for nothing.",
        "Okay, I think that the people who have been engaged in negotiating with the Israelis over the years are aware that there will not be an unlimited right of return.",
        "But they are also aware that it is one of the most important cards that they hold, and there are millions of people who live abroad who are descendants of Palestinian refugees who feel that these people are representing them and need to stand up for their rights.",
        "Let me ask you, Ethan Bronner, as we are talking about this diplomatic language, we are mired in the weeds, as we heard Glenn Kessler describe them, that we have been talking about since 1948, really, in the state of - the creation of the state of Israel, certainly since 1967 and the Six Day War.",
        "And it seems like - is there an impression that the rest of the world is changing quickly, and this is just some time-warp bubble that's sitting there?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, to some extent, that's true.",
        "I think that the - actually the time warp was pretty strong and wide in this region until only a few months ago.",
        "There was a sense that everything was frozen in the Middle East.",
        "And as you said at the top of the show, that is changing very rapidly now, and that's having an effect, as well, on this situation so that there are - the idea that Arabs should stand up to people who have oppressed them and do so en masse is now spreading quite rapidly.",
        "And I think that that's an issue that's also hitting this conflict and that is frightening a lot of Israelis about what's coming in the coming months.",
        "Well, more on that later, but we want to get some listeners involved in the conversation and to what should we learn from the words of the president and from the words of the prime minister that we've heard over the past week, 800-989-8255.",

        "I am just so proud of our president that he is standing up to the conventional creeping of the boundaries here.",
        "And it just seems like flagrant, systematic land grabs based sheerly on power, both economic and military, over the last decades.",
        "And I'm just so proud that our American president is coming out and saying the elephant, you know, is in the room and doing something about it.",
        "What international law would, should and normally applies in this kind of situation in terms of land?",
        "Can we get some light on that subject?",
        "It seems like the responsibility of the international community, not just the parties, to settle this, and it should be under law.",
        "Well, the applicable United Nations resolution is still 242, is that not right, Glenn Kessler?",
        "Yes, that's the resolution that lays open the possibility of exchange of the territories that were taken by Israel in exchange for peace and security.",

        "Many have since proclaimed the peace process at a standstill."
