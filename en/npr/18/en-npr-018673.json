        "And let me turn back to you, Ethan Bronner, and one thing that is changing in terms of how the Palestinians may be approaching this situation, yes, there's a unity agreement now between Fatah, which controls the West Bank, and Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, an organization regarded by Israel and by the United States as a terrorist organization.",
        "But there was a difference, just a couple of weeks ago, when people on what they call Nakba Day, the calamity day, the day that Israel was created, starting walking to the borders.",
        "Yes, it was a very dramatic day.",
        "I mean, for years people have been urging the Palestinians to do this kind of thing, and this was the first time it actually happened.",
        "Now, of course like everything in this region, nothing is uni-causal, and one of the things that happened is that President Assad of Syria was trying to change the subject from his own problems and so allowed several hundred Palestinian refugees to go, and he allowed them to take buses to the Golan Heights and then to challenge Israel's control of the Golan Heights, which of course are a Syrian territory before the '67 war.",
        "So yes, they came and they started to take down the fence, and they were shot at and a few people were killed there, and the same thing happened on the Lebanese side.",
        "It also happened from Jordan and Egypt, but they were stopped.",
        "And then it happened from the West Bank in Gaza.",
        "So it was a very dramatic day, and there is talk that it'll happen again on June 5.",
        "May 15 was the Nakba.",
        "June 5 is known as the Naksa.",
        "Nakba is catastrophe, Naksa is humiliation, and that is the day that the Six Day War started.",
        "So we may see it again, and generally we may see it as we approach September and beyond.",
        "September is when the Palestinians hope that the United Nations General Assembly will recognize a Palestinian state with these 1967 borders.",
        "That's correct.",
        "And so what people are thinking is that if in fact - I mean, I think they're going to start with the Security Council.",
        "We can get into that if you want.",
        "But they are unlikely to get very far because the Americans are expected to veto it."

        "But if they go to the General Assembly and get 150 or 175 countries to agree that - that Palestine is - and the '67 lines - well, the next day, when they wake up and they're still occupied, you can imagine that more kinds of civil disobedience and possibly violence would result.",
        "And I know that Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech to Congress was very well-received there and very well-received by many in Israel.",
        "But you wrote in the New York Times that the content was not necessarily universally acceptable.",
        "Well, I think that in this country, you know, on the street, if you like, Prime Minister Netanyahu was seen as a great champion and wonderful speaker and stood up for what they believed in.",
        "But in the world of policy analysts, diplomats, columnists and people who are worried about policy, they think that, you know, that he missed a great opportunity because by not doing more about negotiations, he's really put behind him the possibility of stopping the move to September and in fact getting the Palestinians back to the negotiating table, which was clearly the goal of the president when he spoke of '67, because the Palestinians have said if we could get negotiations based on the '67 lines and a two to three-month settlement freeze, we would go back to negotiations tomorrow.",
        "Some people believe if they just get the '67 lines, they'll go back to negotiations, but they didn't get it from Prime Minister Netanyahu.",
        "Here's an email from David in Americas, Georgia: Did Netanyahu take his position a step further by saying the Israelis would not give any part of Jerusalem to the Palestinians?",
        "He said Jerusalem must not be divided.",
        "Glenn Kessler, that doesn't seem to be very different from what a lot of Israel prime ministers have said.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean this has certainly been a position of Netanyahu.",
        "I think in the - Ethan may remember this better than me because it's been a while since I've looked at the map.",
        "I do think in the Olmert negotiations there was some discussion of allowing some East Jerusalem neighborhoods that would belong - part of a Palestinian...",
        "Actually, Glenn, it went beyond that.",
        "I mean, in fact, the Olmert-Abbas negotiations, he gave up all Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem to the Palestinian state and in fact gave up what's called the Holy Basin and agreed to a power-sharing with - that would have five countries in charge and rabbis and priests and so on worried about the holy sites.",
        "So he went very far, in fact, so...",
        "Right, but essentially along the lines of the Clinton parameters."

        "That's right.",

        "However, I really believe that the core of the problem is that the Palestinians need to make a statement recognizing the right of Israel to exist.",
        "None of this, none of this can go forward, it will go nowhere, unless, you know, unless the sides come together on both sides having a right to have a state.",
        "The Israelis have done that.",
        "They have done it everywhere and anywhere, even with the president that they have now, who I think most Americans would consider to be pretty much of a hard-liner.",
        "And this man has come out on multiple occasions saying that the Palestinians need a state, they need a home.",

        "There would still be a lot of long, hard negotiating ahead.",

        "But before we get to Hamas, I just want to say that, in fact, in 1993, when the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel exchanged letters and began what was called the Oslo process, the PLO did recognize the existence of the state of Israel as a legitimate state.",
        "What Prime Minister Netanyahu is asking for, and perhaps the listener agrees, is for them to say that it is the Jewish state.",
        "And the Palestinian argument has been: It's not up to us to tell you what your state is.",
        "You're the state of Israel, and there are - 20 percent of your population is Palestinian, non-Jewish.",
        "We don't want to prejudice either their rights or the possibility of a future return of refugees.",
        "So we're not going to tell you what it is.",
        "But we certainly acknowledge that you have a state and a right, a legitimate right to a state.",
        "That's not what Prime Minister Netanyahu wants to hear.",
        "And you are right, Neal, also, that Hamas, which is an important part of the Palestinian political scene, probably about a third, has never acknowledged Israel's legitimacy or existence.",
        "But you know, to make the argument for the Palestinians for a second again, there are plenty of parties in Israel that do not believe there should ever be a Palestinian state, and some of them are in the governing coalition as well.",
        "Charlie, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "And as we go ahead, Ethan Bronner, there are divisions, as you mentioned, within the Palestinians, the big one between Hamas and Fatah, the PLO, who control different entities within the state of - within the Palestinian territories.",
        "But this unity agreement, does that put the kibosh on any hope of negotiation as long as Hamas is part of the Palestinian government?",
        "Well, it is certainly threatening it, at least as far as the Israelis are concerned.",
        "And I think the Americans are quite worried about it too."

        "So who knows?",

        "Yeah.",

        "Whether or not people like it, they have to, you know, they control the territory in Gaza.",

        "And let me ask you, Ethan Bronner, how is Israel responding to the idea that the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza may be open as soon as this weekend?",
        "I think they're nervous about it, but they're nervous about it more because of the signal that they think it sends from what the Egyptian government - how the Egyptian government is looking ahead, which is to say that this is an act of friendship toward Hamas on some level, which was what President Mubarak had always rejected.",
        "And, of course, there is the concern that if the border is open, guys who they do not want to get into Gaza because they're associated with violence or resistance, as the Hamas calls it, will get in.",
        "And, of course, that there generally be less supervision of the border, and that arms and missiles will continue to come in as well.",
        "So the Israelis are upset about it, but I want to tell you that there's also another issue which is that there is a school of thought in Israel which is that let's keep Hamas and - let's keep Gaza focused on Egypt, and let it be the coming and going spot for Gaza.",
        "We close off our border.",
        "Let them deal with it.",
        "And there's a school of thought here and the foreign minister, Lieberman, is a proponent of this, which is not that upset to see all the trade go that direction."
