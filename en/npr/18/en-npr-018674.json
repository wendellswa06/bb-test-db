        "You know, there are several points that I'd like to make, maybe I just make two.",
        "One is that when Netanyahu met with Obama, he basically scolded him, like Sharon did before that when he scolded Bush with his - for - with his roadmap plan.",
        "And Barak did the same thing to Clinton.",
        "So the Palestinians lost more land under this negotiation.",
        "And second, we don't have somebody in the team that oversee the Middle East, that's a Palestinian-American or an Arab-American.",
        "There are a lot of Palestinian-American and Arab-American who are patriots of this country.",
        "And we - a lot of times, most of the people who take care of that are either appointed by the Israeli lobby or something.",
        "One thing I could say, though, is that when Netanyahu spoke in front of the Congress, he proved something that there is a king in America and who is the prime minister of Israel.",
        "That's a fact.",
        "And I cannot see how the settlement that are illegal, they become eventually facts on the ground.",
        "And there is one resolution that your - one of your guest failed to appoint which is 198, which is the Palestinian has the right to return to their home, not those Russians who came from Russia and the Ethiopian.",
        "And the demography now is five and a half million Palestinians in historical Palestine, and there is 5.7 Israelis.",
        "So the difference is only 200,000.",
        "In the year 2014, there will be more Palestinians (unintelligible) Palestine than all the Jews who they brought from Europe or from Russia and from Ethiopia."

        "Appreciate it.",
        "And he is discussing something that a lot of people have concerns about, that pretty soon there won't be a two-state solution possible that some Palestinians argue we want a one-state solution where, as Al just pointed out, we will outnumber the Jews in Israel.",

        "And I don't know how it's going to turn out.",
        "But if you look at the statistics, it does suggest that at some point, Palestinians, it would be better for them to say, hey, let's just become citizens of Israel rather than be occupied.",
        "Ethan Bronner, is this something that worries Prime Minister Netanyahu?",
        "I think it does worry him.",
        "I mean, I think what Glenn is picking up on is that it seemed to so animate people like Ehud Olmert before and others that suddenly they begin to understand that there was no way that Israel could be Jewish and democratic because of the demographic reality.",
        "But - so I don't think that Prime Minister Netanyahu denies that.",
        "I think that he is so animated by other things that it gets sort of pushed out.",
        "So in brief, he's animated by the fact that he - when we look at what's going on in the region - and this is a more recent view of his, of course - that many people, including President Obama, would say, oh my God, you must move quickly because of the big changes that are happening.",
