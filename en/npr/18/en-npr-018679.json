        "Now, when Carol first went to Dr. Zucker, making Bradley feel comfortable with the gender he was born with was not necessarily her aim.",
        "She was just looking for general guidance.",
        "But something Zucker said in their first meeting really affected her.",
        "The one thing that Dr. Zucker said to us that stuck was that, you know, research shows or - that as he grows older, both peer groups may reject him.",
        "Males won't necessarily identify with him if he is, you know, more feminine and that kind of thing.",
        "And eventually, the girls like boys, and they like boys who are boys, and so he may have issues in that respect.",
        "And because, you know, he is a very sociable boy, that painted a very lonely picture.",
        "To redirect her son, Zucker told Carol that she and her husband would have to radically change their parenting.",
        "Bradley would no longer be allowed to spend time with girls, no longer be allowed to play with girlish toys or pretend that he was a female character.",
        "Zucker feels all of these activities are dangerous to a kid with gender identity disorder.",
        "The more you engage in a behavior, the more likely it's going to continue.",
        "If a little boy is only cross-dressing and only role-playing as a female, only playing with toys in the culture that we associate with girls, I think that that gets into a feedback loop that reinforces their identity or fantasy that they are a girl or that they're like a girl.",
        "For Carol and her husband, though, these were huge changes.",
        "By the time Bradley started therapy, he was almost 6 years old, and Carol had a houseful of toys he enjoyed, a houseful of Barbie dolls and Polly Pockets.",
        "She now had to remove them.",
        "To cushion the blow, she didn't take the toys away all at once.",
        "She told Bradley that he could choose one or two toys a day.",
        "I mean, in the beginning, he didn't really care, because he picked stuff he didn't play with.",
        "And sometimes he'd pick his brother's stuff and say, give that away.",
        "Take that.",
        "I don't - you know?",
        "But then when it went really got down to the last few - and he would hide things.",
        "And he combines it with actors reading from court transcripts of the Chicago Seven trial, animating the action through a technique called motion capture.",
        "He turned to coloring and drawing, and he just simply wouldn't play with anything.",
        "And he would color and draw for hours and hours.",
        "And that would be all he did in a day, because I think he was really lost, and the whole way that he knew and understood how to play was just sort of, you know, removed from his house.",
        "And what did he draw?",
        "Girls, rainbows, butterflies, fairies."

        "We would ask him, can you draw a boy for us?",
        "Can you draw a boy in that picture?",
        "And then he didn't really want us to see his drawings or watch him drawing because we would always say, can you draw a boy?",

        "And her face lit up and she's like, yes.",
        "Pam says the drive to the store to choose Jonah's first dress was an experience she will never forget.",

        "Like since before then, or since then, I don't think I have seen her so out-of-her-mind happy as that drive to Target that day to pick out her dress.",
        "Pam allowed Jonah to get two dresses but says she felt incredibly conflicted about it.",
        "And even though Jonah asked, she wouldn't allow him to buy any more dresses for a year afterwards.",
        "And so Jonah wore those two dresses every day, nothing else, until Pam got sick of looking at them.",
        "After a year, when Jonah was around 4, she and Joel finally began to permit other small purchases.",
        "But Joel says every item provoked a crisis.",
        "We'd spend a few nights talking, do you think the shoes are like a line that we should cross?",
        "Or, you know, the girly hat, or the girly jacket with the frills?",
        "Or like what are we doing?",
        "Are we encouraging this?",
        "Are we doing something that we shouldn't be?",
        "And so Joel and Pam also ended up in front of a gender specialist, a psychologist in Oakland named Diane Ehrensaft.",
        "Joel remembers an early session when Pam talked about her concerns.",
        "I remember her talking to the therapist and saying something to the effect of, like, you know, I'd be okay if Jonah just was gay.",
        "I just don't want him to be transgender.",
        "And the therapist just laughed.",
        "She said, you know, 15 years ago, I had people on this couch, saying I don't mind him being a little of effeminate, as long as he's not gay."

        "You see, 35 years ago, homosexuality was considered a mental illness, a pathology so severe that it required aggressive therapeutic intervention.",
        "One common treatment was to try to condition homosexuals out of their sexual preference by attaching them to a electrical shock machines and shocking them every time they were aroused by homosexual pornography.",

        "And if we try and constrict it or bend the twig, we engender poor mental health.",
        "This is why Ehrensaft didn't encourage Pam and Joel to place Jonah in therapy.",
        "Pam says that because Ehrensaft didn't see transgenderism itself as a dysfunction any more than she see homosexuality as a dysfunction, she didn't think it should be treated.",
        "She made it really clear that, you know, if Jonah's not depressed or anxious or having anything go on that she would need to really be in therapy for, then don't put a kid in therapy until they need it.",
        "This is also why Dr. Ehrensaft did encourage Joel and Pam to allow Jonah to live as a little girl.",
        "Now, she doesn't always do that.",
        "If she thinks that a child is less certain about their gender identity or has mixed feelings, she'll ask parents to be cautious and not permit the child to live as the opposite sex.",

        "The mother is very supportive of allowing this child to transition from being a little boy to a little girl.",

        "And, in fact, what I advised to the mother is please slow down.",
        "But Jonah on the West Coast had made it very clear to his parents that he wanted to wear girl clothes full time, that he wanted to be known as a girl, that he wanted his parents to call him their daughter.",
