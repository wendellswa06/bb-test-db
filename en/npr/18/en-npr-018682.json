        "Alexander Litvinenko died in November last year after being poisoned by a radioactive isotope called polonium 210.",
        "He was first taken ill soon after drinking tea at a hotel in London with a former KGB man called Andrei Lugovoi.",
        "On his deathbed, Litvinenko then dictated a letter accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of being behind his poisoning.",
        "At a news conference this morning, the director of Public Prosecutions in Britain, Sir Ken MacDonald, said the Crown Prosecution Services or CPS had decided to charge Lugovoi with the murder.",
        "I have today concluded that the evidence sent to us by the police is sufficient to charge Andrei Lugovoi with the murder of Alexander Litvinenko by deliberate poisoning.",
        "In those circumstances, I've instructed CPS lawyers to take immediate steps to seek the early extradition of Andrei Lugovoi from Russia to the United Kingdom.",
        "Russia's ambassador to London was summoned to the Foreign Office this morning and told in strong terms that full cooperation was expected in Lugovoi's case.",
        "It's not clear that London will get it, though.",
        "Relations between Russia and Britain have, if not returned to the frostiness of the Cold War, at least descended into a cold peace, with disputes over a number of issues from human rights to British investments in Russian oil and gas fields.",
        "And Moscow is angry with London for allowing Russian dissidents — notably oligarch Boris Berezovsky and former Chechen leader Ahmed Zakayev to remain in the British capital.",
        "Alexander Litvinenko's widow, Marina, today thank the British police force at Scotland Yard for their work.",
        "I was waiting for this day all this long - almost four months.",
        "What we received today, I just appreciate.",
        "And I'd like to say I'm very happy about all job of Scotland Yard done already.",
        "Andrei Lugovoi himself who now runs a security company in Moscow responded to the charges saying they politically motivated.",
        "He again denied having anything to do with the death of Alexander Litvinenko, saying he too is a victim.",
        "(Through translator) I did not consider myself guilty.",
        "Moreover, I consider myself a complainant.",
        "The members of my family and myself was subjected to a radioactive attack on the territory of Great Britain.",
        "I did not understand the evidential basis of the charges and I do not understand the motive.",
        "Why would I have vanished and how?",
        "We'll say this at the outset.",
        "Severance, Robert Olen Butler's new collection of stories, is an odd and disturbing book.",
        "The premise for each story are the last thoughts, the last recollections, of people who have been decapitated; hence Severance."

        "The words of these individuals are poetic and brief and seem to link human beings who have suffered this fate, whether they are monarchs or slaves, and reveal in their last moments what is most precious about being alive.",
        "Robert Olen Butler joins us now from our member station, KQED in San Francisco.",
        "Robert Olen Butler, thank you very much for being with us.",
        "It's a pleasure, Jackie.",
        "I think I have to come to right to point on this and ask if you were influenced by what has been a gruesome and all-too-frequent occurrence in the news, and that is of the decapitation of hostages in Iraq and other places in the Middle East.",
        "You know, it's interesting.",
        "Actually, I finished this book just before that began, and in fact there were 60 of these pieces in the book at that point, and I had to go back and put two more in as a result of the events in Iraq.",
        "The book preceded the news, really.",
        "The book preceded the recent news, but this has been in the news for millennia, the beheading of people.",
        "Each story is just 240 words long.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Each is exactly 240 words long, because there are two epigraphs to the book, one from a French doctor of the 19th century who says that after careful study and due deliberation, it's my opinion the head remains conscious for one minute and a half after decapitation; and the other from a handbook of speech which points out that in a heightened state of emotion, we speak at the rate of 160 words a minute.",
        "So if you do the math, 160 words a minute, a minute and half, 240 words.",
        "So each of these 62 little stories is exactly 240 words long.",
        "Well, we should perhaps point out that that's not proved.",
        "Is it?",
        "I mean we don't know that."

        "Oh, no, no, no. But there has always been that suspicion, and there's of course no way to prove it.",
        "But I landed on a minute and a half, and it felt like a very natural length for these outbursts.",
        "Would you choose one to read?",
        "I mean we talk about this going on for millennia.",
        "The book actually begins with someone in prehistory who you call the mud man.",

        "my daughter eaten; my son eaten; my husband.",
        "And I tell them of the Lord God and his own son whose body also was destroyed.",
        "And they cry, that did us no good, and they wail on.",
        "And I say, it did you no good because you have not eaten of your savior.",
        "And I kneel before a priest in a secret place in Rome, and I eat the body and the blood, and afterwards I say, father, shall I leave my arms?",
        "And he says, fight in the Lord's name.",
        "And now I sit on the edge of this ignorant village, and the dragon lifts his head and unfurls his wings.",
        "And I thump my fist upon my breastplate, and I draw my sword.",
        "And in the center of me, there is only the peace that passes all understanding, because of the things I have eaten."

        "This, like so many of these, is about really what is most prized in our souls, and we go through a lot of human souls in this collection: Cicero's, lost American Indians, bandits and overseers, slaves.",
        "But of course I have to come back to why.",
        "I mean in what way did you envision that heads would speak about the lives that they had lived?",
        "Well, what draws a fiction writer are those moments when human beings are focused on what they most profoundly and deeply yearn for.",
        "And when I conceived of this book, that's what the focus was.",

        "The book began when I was in Saigon.",
        "I brought my wife.",
        "We went to the war crimes museum, and amidst the unexploded ordinance and the rusting American airplanes there was a guillotine that the French used until they left in 1954.",
        "And standing before that extraordinary, infernal machine, suddenly I put it together that what more extraordinary moment of self-reflection and profound return to the yearning of your soul than in the moment when your head has just been cut off.",
        "Did anyone say to you, Robert, maybe this isn't really such a great idea?",
        "I can't get past the repellant aspect of it.",
        "Well, certainly that suspicion was floated by people around me.",
        "My French publisher actually was the one that encouraged me the most.",
