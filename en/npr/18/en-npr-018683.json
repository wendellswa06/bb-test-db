        "He spent two days at an international hotel outside the Green Zone, and that's where he made contact with The Associated Press and reporter Jason Straziuso.",
        "He came down from his floor and knocked on our doors and said, `Hi.",
        "I'm Farris.",

        "He presented himself as someone who was here to do research.",
        "He was interested in journalism, maybe kind of an internship type person.",
        "But, really, we were just flabbergasted that a 16-year-old from the United States, by himself, had knocked on our door in the middle of a war zone.",
        "He was curious from the get-go.",
        "This was not anything about, `I'm in danger.",

        "I think that at that point, though, he had been in Baghdad for just about two days, and I think that he knew how dangerous it was.",
        "You know, the first full day he was here, six car bombs went off in Baghdad; five people were killed and 40 were wounded.",
        "And he had an experience on his first or second day where he actually wandered out of the safe area of our hotel and went to a food stand.",
        "And it was at that food stand that he tried to order food, which is a big problem for Farris because he doesn't speak Arabic.",
        "And he actually pulled out an Arabic phrase book and tried to order using that.",
        "And he saw that he was drawing a lot of attention to himself, and he told me he was getting a little freaked out and quickly left that food stand.",
        "And that may have been his first situation in Baghdad where he thought, `OK, this is really risky.'",

        "And embassy officials were very interested in his safety.",
        "You know, it was a short time later that a lieutenant from the 101st Airborne was in the lobby of our hotel to pick Farris up and take him to the Green Zone.",
        "Why did he do this?",
        "What did he tell you about his motivation here?",
        "Well, he wrote an essay both--before he left and finished it in Kuwait, and it's really, really touching and from the heart for a 16-year-old.",
        "And he talks about the suffering that he sees in Iraq and that the only way to overcome that suffering is for people to get up and do something.",
        "This is just an idealistic teen-ager who's trying to make the world better.",
        "You can throw in naive and lucky, but idealistic also.",
        "He thought that he could come over here and do some good.",
        "Yet he wanted to do some academic research, but he said that he wanted to do humanitarian work.",
        "Had he done a little bit more research, he would have found out that that's really hard to do because there aren't a lot of humanitarian organizations here because it's just too dangerous.",

        "We have a security setup, and he in no way altered that.",

        "Every time you're in a vehicle out in Baghdad, you risk being the target of a roadside bomb, an IED or a car bomb or a rocket-propelled grenade.",
        "So they're not saying that Farris cost them safety and security, but they are saying that they put considerable resources into making sure he was safe.",

        "Howard, what did the members of the Cabinet have to say today?",

        "Most notably missing, though, were programs focused on law enforcement, and that's where much of the criticism has come of administration policy.",
        "In fact, the administration has proposed budget cuts in law enforcement programs that local law enforcement officials say they use and need to combat meth.",
        "So there are new programs and new funding.",

        "I've been talking to a few local officials about that and people who pay attention to how the money actually trickles down.",

        "So they're not sure that it really is new money.",
        "There is some money, though, that will go for drug court programs like the one that they visited here in Nashville today, a program which offers treatment instead of jail time for addicted convicts.",
        "And there is some new money over the next three years, $16 million nationally spread over three years, that will support similar kinds of programs.",
        "Howard, just quickly, that residential drug court, does that explain why they chose Nashville?",
        "This is the first residential drug court in the country.",

        "They believe that when they're criticized for not focusing enough on meth, people are forgetting that there are these other drugs that must be addressed and that there are many things that they're doing to address those drugs, meth being one.",
        "But they like this kind of program.",
        "Residential treatment is critical for meth.",
        "It is the kind of program that is necessary because meth is such a persistent drug and is so hard to kick.",
