        "Exactly.",
        "I've talked to a number of people in Texas, former students, other colleagues, about her role as a lawyer, her role as the bar president, her role on issues of policy and their views about Harriet Miers on issues of race and justice, that she was a moderate; that even though she expressed strong views about the woman's right to choose, that she was open to different points of view.",
        "And I think what she was was she was a David Souter, an unknown, unpredictable, stealth candidate, and look what happened with David Souter.",

        "And you know what?",
        "Gender, a non-judge, all those factors that were relevant three weeks ago will go out the window, and I wouldn't be surprised to see a white male conservative probably sitting on the court not too far from where we are here in Washington today and someone who'll be easily confirmable by a Senate Republican majority.",
        "Terry Neal, here's the interesting aspect for me in all of this, and that is I am not hearing enough of reporting from the media with the idea of the real strength of the minority within the minority, and that, in fact, is this evangelical right-wing faction of the Republican Party that seems to be driving, quite frankly, the president's movements, certainly as relates to this nomination.",
        "You know, I think it's fairly clear, most people understand what's happening.",
        "If you look at The Washington Post and the washingtonpost.com today, there are several stories about the power of the punditocracy, which is linked to a lot of evangelical right, but I would say this: I mean, in response sort of to what Professor Ogletree was saying about believing that she's a moderate, there's two things that conservatives cared about, OK, in this last election, two things that they sought to get done.",
        "When Bush ran in 2000--I covered the Bush campaign for The Post in 2000--there were tax cuts, number one, and number two, they were changing the courts.",
        "I think--and this is speculation because we don't know what happened between President Bush and Harriet Miers in their private conversations, but I think he knows her very well, and I think he has a pretty strong idea what sort of justice she would be.",
        "The problem with him is that he has no reservoir of good will, in part because of David Souter and what his father did in putting David Souter on the bench.",

        "Well, I think we need to be very careful and cautious about giving this conservative minority a sense that they are in some sense a majority.",
        "President Bush barely won the election in 2004, and there are questions about whether or not he won the election in 2000, but that's behind us.",

        "That's what they want.",
        "That's not what they're going to be able to get in this Congress in the 21st century.",
        "And I think it's really incumbent upon the president to think about the fact that this was a close election, it's a deeply divided country, the issue of a woman's right to choose is settled, and they should not at all allow this to influence his nominee.",
        "I think what Senator Schumer said, a centrist, an O'Connor-like candidate is what the country needs, a healing process.",

        "Are we going to see, if in fact, we see a hard-line conservative named as the nominee, a real fight from the left, filibusters and all?",
        "I think you will, and I think that the White House is probably going to be very careful.",
        "They want to find someone like John Roberts who's well known in conservative circles but didn't have the sort of paper trails on contentious social issues that the Democrats could pull out and make an easy case against him.",

        "I mean, the problem with the Democrats over the last few years has been their inability to come together and unite on even the most, you know, obvious sort of things.",
        "One of them would be Iraq, but, I mean, there have been example after example--the bankruptcy bill, so many things at which the party has failed to do that, and John Roberts, too.",
        "So I do think that there's going to be a serious fight.",
        "Whether they can be successful as the minority party, that will require a sort of unification that I haven't seen--that we haven't seen from the party in a long time.",
        "So this could be a defining moment.",
        "One plus for moderates certainly, liberals perhaps, Charles, is the idea that the longer this process rolls itself out, the more cases that Sandra Day O'Connor will continue to hear."

        "It's inconceivable that there'll be a nominee in October or November or--and the Congress will be in recess until January.",
        "Here's the interesting thought we should keep on our mind: The president has the power to make a recess appointment, and he could make a very powerful statement by appointing a conservative that would serve for a very long time until the Senate would have a time to take it up.",
        "And it would be very hard to sort of unravel that.",
        "If he makes a recess appointment, which is one of his options, the Democrats will be completely off guard, they will have lost their momentum, they will have no ability to oppose it, and the president will be able to at least appease that hard right by saying, `Here's someone who's on the court now while we wait for a formal hearing,' which wouldn't happen till January or later, 2006.",
        "Terry, real quickly, if he, in fact--he being the president--makes the, quote, \"\"right nomination\"\" for the conservative bent, slant of his party, does this put him on terra firma where he has been free-falling for some time?",
        "Well, you know, in a lot of ways, I think it does because--and here's the reason: The president's support among the middle has eroded.",

        "The only place he has support is on the right, and I don't think that he's--he's got a much better chance of regaining some support among his base than among the people that he's lost, and he's got to have at least them back before he can begin working on the middle and pushing some of the rest of his agenda.",
        "But I really think a lot of this is going to depend on the effectiveness of the Democrats in opposing the president on this issue and on his agenda.",
