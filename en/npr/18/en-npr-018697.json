        "Simba admits though that many conservative mainlanders agree with the Chinese government.",
        "They don't believe Hong Kong has anything to teach the mainland, and they dissidence and activists as traitors.",
        "UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Speaking foreign language) (Through translator) A lot of mainlanders have been brainwashed.",
        "They think the protesters are making trouble, they think the government is good.",
        "They say you have enough to eat and drink, why do you want to struggle for freedom and democracy?",
        "Aren't you free?",
        "Then again, Simba says, on the mainland, Internet searches for text or pictures about the protests in Hong Kong are being blocked by a Chinese government firewall.",
        "So just like getting over that firewall, visiting Hong Kong can be a mind-expanding experience.",
        "UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Foreign language spoken) (Through translator) Before we got over the firewall, we were like pigs.",
        "We knew nothing.",
        "We thought we were fortunate and free.",
        "But as soon as we found out about the outside world, we realized that what we thought was freedom is really not."
