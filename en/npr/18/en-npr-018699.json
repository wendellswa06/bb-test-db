        "I'm fine.",
        "My question is: how long will it take the Republicans to decide - or maybe they're already on the road to deciding this - that the president is enough of an albatross around their neck, he doesn't have to run again in 2008, that they're just willing to dump him and his policies and start moving forward and taking care of their own interest?",
        "Well, they still, you know, want to dump his money-raising abilities and, of course, all these senators who've been, and House members, who have been critical of the president on the war, on Alberto Gonzales, on the immigration bill, when President Bush comes to their district or states for a fundraiser they welcome him with open arms, perhaps they'd rather not have it with cameras there.",
        "But again, so here is a mixed, sort of - unlike Ronald Reagan in 1988, who left office very, very popular, Bush's numbers are really, really low down.",
        "And if the Republican Party is to avoid the kind of a year that they had in 2006 and 2008, they're going to have do what we saw in the presidential debate, basically, more and more candidates distancing themselves from the president.",
        "Well, is he actually still able to bring in large amounts of cash for them?",
        "And if so, why?",
        "Well, he's still the president of the United States, and as soon - you know, he still remains popular with the Republican base.",
        "I mean, 75 percent.",
        "Some polls show that 75 percent of the Republicans still support the president, still support his conduct of the war, support the surge, things like that.",
        "But ultimately, in a general election, when you throw in independents and Democrats, that support disappears completely.",
        "Well, is that Republican base shrinking at the same time?",
        "It is.",
        "And that's why you'll find that if you look at the money raised by their candidates - the presidential candidates who've been raising money, every cycle, until now, it was the Republicans who always raise the most money.",
        "You'll see it at the end of the month once again, as we saw the in last quarter, that it is the Democratic candidates who are raising the most money, having the most donors, and raising the most enthusiasm.",
        "Elvis, thanks very much for the call.",

        "Basically, the developer wants to build homes, but there's not really a road to reach his home and he needs an interchange on the Interstate 75.",
        "The congressman came in town and, I guess, they had a little fundraiser for them and raised some money for them, and next thing you know we have an earmark for this interchange, a study that could be done on this interchange.",
        "And the curious thing is this congressman is not anybody from Florida, not somebody from that district, but Don Young of Alaska.",
