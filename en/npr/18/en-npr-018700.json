        "And if you like at the ways he misled Congress both in that (unintelligible) and then in the federal prosecutor - you know, personally, the guy ought to be impeached.",

        "He has never been accused of breaking any law.",
        "Nothing, as Tony Snow said today, that no charges, he's never broken any law.",
        "But the real story to me maybe the fact that as if Gonzales where to go, to leave or be fired, whom does President Bush get to replace him and what kind of a nominee could he pick that a Democratic-controlled Senate would confirm?",
        "Obviously, he wouldn't go the moderate route.",
        "We've seen with his Supreme Court choices that President Bush wants to have a conservative administration and he's comfortable with conservative choices.",
        "Would a Democratic-led Senate go for that?",
        "And that's, I think, one of the real questions and one of the reasons why Gonzales is staying as long as he has.",

        "But it looks like the Republicans could very well lose the governorship, but they waited 40 or 35 years to take Governor Ernie Fletcher.",
        "I think one of the reasons that Mitch McConnell backed Anne Northup for governor is that they feel about the incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher is damaged goods, could lose in November.",

        "You know, polls, eight months out is kind of crazy.",
