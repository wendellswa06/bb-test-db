        "Twenty-two years ago when Blockbuster was founded, videos were still being rented on Betamax.",
        "Since then, Blockbuster, which is based in Dallas, has weathered many changes in the video rental industry, new formats and new competitors.",
        "Through the 1990s, despite predictions that with cable and the Internet the days of video rental stores were numbered, Blockbuster continued to grow, absorbing competitors and generally turning a tidy profit.",
        "In the early part of this decade, though, the world's largest video rental company ran into trouble.",

        "By taking the DVDs back to a Blockbuster store, Kulchnee says, video junkies quickly realized they were getting more rentals for their money.",

        "It involved Blockbuster's profitability and whether Antioco was entitled to a multimillion-dollar bonus.",
        "After a string of years in which it lost money, in 2006 Blockbuster was finally able to turn a profit, in part by cutting costs and closing on profitable stores.",

        "But the success of Total Access shows that the company is on the right track.",

        "So I think that was the real victory.",
        "That Netflix is no longer really cutting into their core business.",
        "The value of Total Access, says Blockbuster, is that it's increasing traffic at the company's stores, where customers don't just rent movies, they also buy them, along with popcorn, soda and other things on which Blockbuster makes a lot of money.",
        "One delicate issue, though, may be pricing.",
        "Blockbuster currently is charging the same fees as Netflix.",

        "Supreme Court agreed unanimously.",

        "Well, Robert, like almost anyone else with an investment portfolio, life insurers are feeling the market's pain, and some are especially squeezed because in healthier times, they promise to deliver at least minimum annuity payments.",
        "And now those guarantees are no longer supported by the investments underlying them.",
        "The recession could make matters worse, because life insurers invest your premium dollars in an array of assets and stocks and bonds in commercial mortgages, and if the recession brings a wave of defaults, that could further undermine life insurance companies."
