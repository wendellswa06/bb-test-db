        "While Solicitor General Clement will be acting attorney general once Gonzales leaves and may be a contender himself, the name that was most often heard today as the likely successor was that of Michael Chertoff, a former federal judge, former federal prosecutor, assistant attorney general, and now, secretary of Homeland Security.",

        "It's possible, but it's hardly a slam-dunk.",

        "Senator Specter and I are working together, could easily, if the White House wanted, could easily give them a list of people who would have no problem being confirmed.",

        "They would be, I guess, foolish not to use the leverage they have.",
        "On the other hand, the nominee would be much more foolish to accept that.",
        "And so we've got the making of an impasse there.",
        "At the same time, Fried knows anyone who's offered the job of attorney general should have some leverage of his or her own to negotiate a higher level of independence than the Bush administration has accorded its two previous attorneys general."
