        "They may look and sound the same, but he says his SWAT team is not in the business of barging into houses unless there's a clear danger.",
        "This is the biggest stick in the agency, and we don't use that stick unless we can quantify it somehow with either weapons history, statements made by suspects, availability to weapons.",
        "All these different factors that we take into account prior to us even saying OK, we're going to take this operation on and deploy it.",
        "And private SWAT officers often criticize the drug task forces, which proliferated in the '80s and '90s.",
        "They don't like how the task forces seem focused on taking suspects by surprise so they can keep them from flushing the drugs.",
        "SWAT officers say the tactics should be about protecting lives, not evidence.",
        "But Mudrock admits that all tactical police are now feeling pressure.",
        "We've had some of these blurred lines over the years.",
        "And I agree with the legislation on that we're trying to professionalize this a little bit and make it more standardized.",
        "Besides requiring numbers, the Utah legislature has also tightened the rules.",
        "Officers have to wear clearly marked uniforms and body cameras if they have them.",
        "And the law now clarifies that simple possession or use of illegal drugs is not enough to justify the police breaking down your door.",
        "On the receiving end of this kind of legislation is Troy Burnett, sitting in a diner in Ogden.",
        "He does the interview here because he's on a drug task force and the office location is supposed to stay secret.",
        "In fact, he's on the Weber-Morgan Narcotics task force.",
        "That's the same task force that raided Matthew Stewart's house in 2012.",

        "I did.",

        "And a lot of my other friends were hurt.",
        "And I thought it was just so unnecessary.",
        "He wasn't on the task force at the time of the raid, but he's convinced that Matthew Stewart knew full well that he was shooting at police.",
        "Burnett rejects the suggestion that drug task forces are reckless, and he says he doesn't mind that the state is now keeping track of the operations.",
        "But he also believes that the debate over tactical operations has been tangled up with something very different - the question of whether drugs like marijuana should be illegal.",
        "Here's the thing.",

        "And to me, the smell of those freshly dried clothes is so much like the smell of a thunderstorm just passing through.",
        "Now, there are a lot of companies that have tried to bottle that smell and capture that scents that you have, making laundry detergents, hair sprays, all kinds of things that try to smell like rain, but none of them can quite capture the scent.",
        "Why is that so much harder to do, say, than reproducing the smell of lemon or apple?",
        "It's very difficult to mimic exactly all of the minute ingredients that are present in a lot of the naturally occurring odors.",
        "Some of them are so low that they go undetected by the instrumentation that a lot of the perfumers and chemists used.",
