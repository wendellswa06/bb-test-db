        "Tonight at the Democratic National Convention, Julian Castro will deliver the keynote speech, prompting many Americans to ask - who?",
        "The 37-year-old mayor of San Antonio, Texas is Castro.",
        "He is what many will call the new face of the Democratic Party.",
        "From San Antonio, Texas Public Radio's David Martin Davies has more.",
        "Good morning, folks.",
        "We have four different kinds of tacos.",
        "We have...",
        "It's the weekend before the start of the Democratic National Convention, and in San Antonio, St. Paul Catholic Church parishioners like Larry Ybarra are sending off one of their own with a breakfast taco rally.",
        "I think it's a great step when you look at - the progressions happen with the parties that have gone from not recognizing the Hispanic community to having somebody in the very front, you know, being the keynote speaker.",
        "That's like a thousand percent improvement over the last several years.",
        "This is the neighborhood where Julian Castro and his twin brother Joaquin grew up - going to high school at Jefferson just down the street.",
        "Before becoming mayor, Julian first represented this working class Mexican-American neighborhood on the city council.",
        "Brother Joaquin is their state rep in Austin and Democratic nominee for Congress.",
        "Hi, how are you?",
        "But if you want to know Julian and Joaquin, you need to start with their mother, Rosie.",
        "As a single mom, she raised the two boys and pushed them to stay out of trouble and excel in school.",
        "At the rally, she's greeted at the door with kisses and chants from the crowd.",
        "Rosie, Rosie, Rosie, Rosie.",
        "Julian's story of success is similar to President Barack Obama's and local Tea Party activists like George Rodriguez say there's another comparison between the two.",
        "I see a very, very clear similarity between the upbringing that Mr. Obama had in a nontraditional home and being mentored by radicals, and same thing with the Castros being brought up in a nontraditional home by their mother, who herself was a member of the Raza Unida Party, which was very, very radical."

        "Rosie was one of its leaders in South Texas.",
        "She broke barriers by organizing voter registration, getting out the vote, and putting new Mexican-American candidates on the ballot.",
        "Julian shrugs off any suggestion that Raza Unida was a radical cell.",

        "Castro said he did watch parts of last week's GOP convention and he expects a more positive tone at the DNC.",
        "He's been practicing using the teleprompter and tweaking the script that he says will tell his version of the American Dream and explain why he supports the president's re-election.",

        "Jennifer McGregor writes: While I recognize that reluctant landlords may find some truly horrible renters, it seems just as likely to me that these landlords do not realize what it means to be a good landlord.",

        "If the renter is paying the amount of your mortgage, shouldn't he or she also receive a benefit?",
        "McGregor continues: I agree with the other responders who recommend landlords hire professional rental management companies.",

        "As you and I sit here today, this still seems rather unlikely.",

        "Remember, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has always been an impeachment skeptic.",
        "She has set a bar that would have to be, in her words, overwhelming and bipartisan, meaning you would need to get some Republicans on board to do it, namely Senate Republicans.",
        "And if anything, the response from Republicans on Capitol Hill to Robert Mueller's report was, case closed.",
        "Time to move on.",

        "You look to the progressive left or the activist left where you have freshmen lawmakers like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York or Ilhan Omar of Minnesota who, in response to the report, signed on to a resolution calling for impeachment proceedings to begin in the House Judiciary Committee.",
        "That is a resolution offered by another female freshman lawmaker - Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat from Michigan.",
        "Also, you have some of the leading 2020 contenders - Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called for the House to begin impeachment proceedings.",
        "It is certainly a reflection of where the party's base is, but it is not the presiding sentiment of the party.",
