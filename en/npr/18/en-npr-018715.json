        "Is this a landmark for race in America or is this more personality-base politics?",
        "I think that's still to be determined at this point.",
        "I think that it could be a personality-base politics.",
        "And I think that's something that black voters in particular in South Carolina, who I've been talking to, had been concerned with.",
        "They were - they've been reluctant to support Obama or to throw their support behind Obama in part because they weren't sure that he was part of the movement or represented a new movement.",
        "And so I think that this is a great victory.",
        "And, but, I think it remains to be seen whether this really will be a kind of a new movement and a start of reconstruction as people are hoping for in the South.",
        "That's Megan Kurtz.",
        "She's the only one of her group that owns a car.",
        "I found Kurtz, Mackenzie Yates, Katie Gills and Mike Clubb at an In-N-Out Burger.",
        "Clubb says he wishes he could afford a car.",
        "My girlfriend drives me everywhere.",
        "That sounds sad and like, 20 years ago, I'd be considered pathetic.",
        "But it's almost normal now, to be that way.",
        "Clubb says for many of his friends, the web and social media can take the place of a car.",
        "You can visually communicate with each other like that - like in the snap of a finger - other than, you know, spending 10 bucks in gas that you don't have and then seeing the same, exact thing."

        "Yes, they are.",
        "Those kids that Sonari Glinton talked to are the microcosm of what's going on among teen drivers.",
        "It's something like 28 percent of teenagers who have their driver's licenses at 16 - which is down 20 or 30 percent from a quarter-century ago.",
        "And even by the time they graduate, you still have a big portion of teenagers who haven't taken driver's ed and don't have a license.",
        "Why not?",
        "Couple of reasons.",
        "The most often - reason cited, in a new University of Michigan study, is that they just don't have the time.",
        "Many states have now changed teen driving laws, so you have to spend a certain amount of time in the car with a parent.",
        "There are limits on when you can drive.",

        "I don't need to get a license right now.",
        "I'm not going to bother.",
        "Another reason is that cars are very expensive.",
        "The average car now costs over $31,000, and that's before you factor in insurance, which is very high for teens even if they're on their parents' insurance.",
        "It means their parents have to pay more for them to be on their insurance.",
        "Gas costs $4 a gallon, in a lot of places.",
        "And then I think the third factor that teens cite is the fact that someone can drive them around, like the young man whose girlfriend in Modesto is driving him around.",
        "So they can get rides from friends, and rides from parents; and they don't see a need to own a car of their own or get a license, even.",
        "So all of this sounds like very bad news for the auto industry, still a big important industry in the U.S.",
        "Are the big automakers worried about it?"

        "Some of the messaging that's going on is targeted in shows like \"\"American Idol,\"\" where Ford has been a sponsor for years.",
        "And they've tried to show driving is fun, is something you can do with your friends.",
        "Another tactic is to realize that younger people are interested in technology, and so put a lot of technology into their cars, make them just as comfortable with the technology in automobiles as they are with their mobile devices.",
