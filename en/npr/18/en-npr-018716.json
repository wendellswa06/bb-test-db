        "The punch, which clinched victory over Ali in the so-called fight of the century, started around Joe Frazier's left hip.",
        "But its origins stretched back a couple of decades to segregated South Carolina, where a young boy from a sharecropping family, Frazier was about eight, fashioned a punching bag out of a burlap sack stuffed with rags and corncobs and Spanish moss.",
        "By Frazier's own estimation, he slugged that thing for the next six or seven years damn near every day.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"\"JOE FRAZIER: WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARS\"\")",
        "And fighting would take him on a trajectory from South Carolina to Japan, where he won a gold medal at the 1964 Olympics, to the top of the professional heavyweight division by the late '60s.",
        "Along the way, Frazier developed his distinctive style, bending at the waist, ducking under opponent's punches, all the while moving forward, relentlessly forward, looking to throw those punches.",
        "Fearsome punches - literally.",
        "I was scared as hell to work with Joe Frazier and to get hit by Joe Frazier.",
        "I was scared.",
        "That's former heavyweight champion Larry Holmes, who once worked as Frazier's sparring partner.",

        "That was inside the ring.",

        "And I think that a lot of the same operatives for McCain and for Romney are still working there who are working there in 2000.",

        "It's a pretty old tactic.",
