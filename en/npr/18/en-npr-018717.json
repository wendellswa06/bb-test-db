        "You know, Farai, one of things I'm looking at what's happening in Kenya has been rarely sad to watch, particularly since I've been following Kenyan politics for about two decades.",
        "I know Raila Odinga, the opposition leader, first met him almost 20 years ago, when I was in Kenya writing about this movement that was happening at the time toward political pluralism.",
        "And indeed, at the time, he had been arrested; he'd been followed by the secret police.",
        "In fact, we were at a meeting one day and he said to me, the secret police follows me everywhere and I'll show you proof of that.",
        "Let's go - we were heading to another meeting and he said, instead of taking the elevators in this building, let's take the stairwell.",
        "We went down the stairwell and halfway down, there were three men standing in the stairwell.",
        "They sort of nodded at each other and he kept going.",
        "And when we got out the building, he says, that's the secret police that's been following me.",
        "The good news coming out of that is that five years ago, he was part of this coalition that was elected with President Kibaki and many of us had so much hope for Kenya at the time, that Kenya was now going to become a far more democratic than it had before, after almost 30 years of the previous president, Daniel arap Moi.",
        "Now, this has really got a lot of us scratching our heads and wondering, you know, what's happening to Kenya and hoping that the international community -and we've seen, to some extent, we're seeing some of it happening now because things are much better today than they were earlier in the week.",
        "There are - now, President Kibaki is talking about if the courts agree, he is willing to have another election.",
        "But this present Kibaki, who many of us thought was going to be far more of a democratic president, has turned out to be anything but and I think that the international community needs to keep his feet to the fire and be very vigilant as we look at what's happening in Kenya now.",
        "He hasn't been much of a friend to the press, has he, either?",
        "He has not and in fact, and neither has his wife.",
        "And there have been many reports about not long - I guess three years after he was elected, his wife went to one of the newspapers and I think slapped around one of the editors because she was not in favor of the reporting on her.",
        "But a lot of the things that he's been doing, I mean, shortly after the elections were announced by this electoral commission, the commission to look at the elections, electoral commission - in fact the head of the commission said that he was pressured into giving and into announcing the results early.",
        "And the president, it seems, within minutes after the announcement came, the president was inaugurated, was sworn in for a second term, which is so much unlike what happened the first time, where there was a great deal of celebration that, you know, that a new day had arrived in Kenya.",
        "Well…",
        "And the more that we've got to learn about him over the last several years, the more we see that he's more in the vein of his predecessor, President Moi, than he is of even really as a father, Raila's father, Oginga Odinga, the former vice president of Kenya.",
        "Let me get Bob and Clarence in this.",
        "Bob, there was, of course, the bombing of the U.S.",
        "embassy in Kenya.",
        "And that preceded 9/11.",
        "Do you think that for either strategic reasons or humanitarian reasons that the U.S.",
        "government, the current administration will plug in to what's going on in Kenya, and if so, how?",
        "I don't know that they will.",
        "Of course, they would be quite hypocritical if they did not, for all the time that they have spent talking about democracy.",
        "But I do - I think one of the problems here is that there's so little understanding of Kenya or politics and I'm one of the people who doesn't understand it, you know, as nearly as well as John, but it seems to me that the media coverage has been very confused and confusing, and that makes it, you know, easier for the Bush administration not to be putting as much pressure as they might, not spare on this, because it's a clear situation, it's a fairly clear situation there.",
        "And - but it does seem that there's an attempt to portray what's happening in Kenya as another example of, you know, even Rwanda, it's - the media doesn't understand Kenya very well.",
        "And I think that's unfortunately that affects what our foreign policy is toward them.",
        "Clarence, do you think that the U.S.",
        "is going to invest on any level?",
        "I mean…"

        "I tried to get something - she's called for some kind of a reconciliation, whether it is through a recount, which the European Union had called for, because their monitors got Odinga kind of knocked around and obstructed during this election.",

        "It has been most important country in so many ways in east Africa and not just since the Bush's War on Terror, but as a commercial hub, as a transportation hub, a media hub, et cetera.",
        "And it's just terrible tragedy what has happened here.",
        "But we can hope that Odinga and Kibaki, because of their past coalition, that there are avenues here to bring them together and they've given verbal indications that they are willing to negotiate, but they're too far apart to get to the same room just yet.",
