        "So in all of this narrative - your story of what you've been through, coming back - how important is tonight to you?",
        "It is very important to me.",
        "You know, I'm willing to try anything, you know.",
        "And so, I'm hopeful that this will at least let me get in touch with who I really am, and not this monster I've become of being violent and wreaking havoc on other people because I'm hurting.",

        "There's a feeling of anticipation in the air, as medicine man Arnold Thomas gathers the rattles and drum he'll use for the ceremony.",
        "So I'll pass this tobacco around and take some out and pass it around.",
        "And it'll be about 15, 20 minutes and we'll go ahead and get going...",
        "The veterans quietly go off to change.",
        "The men put on swim shorts, and the women wrap themselves in sheets that they wear like a toga.",
        "The medicine man enters the lodge and the veterans line up in front of the small opening.",
        "(unintelligible), all my relations.",
        "Two helpers are busy bringing the glowing stones into the lodge from the fire pit, scooping them out with a pitchfork, brushing off the embers, and carefully walking them into the center of the lodge.",
        "(Singing)",
        "Arnold leads the group in a prayer song that gives thanks to the trees for giving us oxygen to breathe, fruit for sustenance and wood for shelter.",
        "The intensity of the song builds with each repetition, until he stops singing then asks the assistants to seal the entrance with heavy fabric."

        "So I'm going to turn off.",
        "Inside the lodge, it's pitch black and the group of about 20 sits in a tightly packed circle as the medicine man pours water onto the stones to create steam.",
        "For the next several hours he leads the group in a series of songs and prayers.",
        "Three times during the ceremony, the entrance is uncovered to let in the cool night air.",
        "A faint light from the nearby parking lot slants through the billowing steam, lighting the group in silhouette for those few minutes.",
        "During one of these breaks, the medicine man pulls out a clutch of eagle feathers, then asks the new veteran to stand and walk over to him.",
        "He says a blessing, then with the feathers, makes scraping motions over Jared's entire body, from head to toe, cleansing him of war.",

        "The Southern Baptist Convention is rooted in the rift over slavery, which it supported, and not too long ago, it backed segregation.",
        "Now, the church has since apologized, but it's been slow going trying to diversify.",
        "Eighty percent of its 16 million members are white, but that's actually starting to change, in part because in a few months, Pastor Fred Luter will seek the presidency of the Southern Baptist Convention.",
        "And if he wins, he'll become its first ever African-American president.",
        "Luter began his career preaching on the streets of the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans where he grew up, and he was never formally trained, and in fact, he doesn't come from a long line of preachers either.",

        "My mom and dad were divorced when I was 6 years old, and we've had divorces and remarriages all throughout our family history.",
        "And when people tell me about their family reunions and how their families get together for this and that, I tell folk, I mean I would love to have a family reunion.",
        "I say, but if we had a family reunion, you'd have to call security.",

        "You started preaching on the streets of the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans.",
        "How did that start?",
        "I grew up in the 'hood and my mom worked two or three jobs, so I hung out with a lot of bad guys, did a lot of crazy things I should not have done.",
        "And so when I gave my life to the Lord and saw what God did in my life, then I wanted all those guys I ran the street with to experience what I was experiencing.",
        "So I would be on the street corners every Saturday of the week telling my testimonies, sharing my faith, passing out tracts.",
        "And that's why, you know, I preach real fast.",
        "When people hear me preach, they ask me why I preach so fast and I tell them, well, I started out on the street corner.",
        "When you're on the street corner, people are moving fast and quick, you know, so they're not sitting down in the pew like that.",
        "So I had to say it fast and quick.",
        "And once I came into the church, I never learned how to slow it down.",
        "So people come to my church today who remember me way back when and say, man, I remember you.",
        "I thought you were crazy.",
        "I thought you were a religious nut.",
        "But, man, I see you've hung in there and you stuck with it.",
        "And so - and I just thank the Lord for it.",
        "It's an amazing story, because you went from being a street preacher to the head of the largest Southern Baptist church in Louisiana, the Franklin Avenue Baptist Church.",
        "You were the first African-American vice president of the Southern Baptist Convention.",
        "You are going to run for president this June when the convention meets in New Orleans, and you would be heading up a church that is still about 80 percent white.",
        "There are Hispanics, Asians, African-Americans, there've been inroads made to those communities but still a small percentage..."

        "Yes.",
        "O'BRIEN: Well, I think there's a couple of things that are important.",
        "First and foremost is, yes, Michael Cohen is a completely imperfect messenger.",
        "When he got his - when his sentencing memo came in in late December from the U.S.",
        "Attorney's Office for the Southern District, they pointed out that they wanted a higher - a heavier sentence for him because they didn't feel that his conversion to a person of remorse and conscience was authentic.",
        "And he was a very rabid, thuggish enforcer for Trump.",
        "Having said that, Michael Cohen has tapes of conversations.",
        "Michael Cohen has canceled checks.",
        "He has letters.",
        "He has email.",
        "He has proof of what he's saying.",
        "So regardless of whether or not he's a perfect messenger, there's a lot of substance behind what he's saying.",
        "I don't think the federal government, who relied on him as a witness, would be using him solo to build a case against the Trump organization.",
        "They also, I think, probably have much deeper information than Michael Cohen.",
        "I think, secondly, what's the signature moment here about his testimony is it was televised, and it was televised at length.",
        "It brought the Trump saga into people's homes in a way that the print media and law enforcement indictments had not to - up to that point.",
        "To your point about the substance, Cohen testified that Donald Trump inflated his assets when it advanced his interests and understated their value when it suited his interests, especially for tax purposes.",
        "You know, reporters like yourself have documented years' worth of behavior like this.",
        "Do you have any sense of why authorities, either in New York or other states where he has properties, or the federal government has not acted on this conduct previously?",
        "I mean, if indeed it rises to the level of criminality, shouldn't somebody have known this before now?",
        "O'BRIEN: Well, certainly the banks knew it, Michel.",
        "And they knew it in the early 1990s when he left them on the hook for more than $3 billion, and he almost went personally bankrupt.",
        "And he had guaranteed about $900 million of that that he couldn't repay, and his businesses could not repay the rest.",
        "I think the banks did not go after him legally because it would've been so embarrassing to them to go to court and to say, we got suckered.",
        "As a group, we're the biggest banks in the United States, and this guy took us for a ride.",
        "And we shouldn't have loaned him that much money, but we didn't do our due diligence.",
        "That's the reason I think that event never got him in trouble.",
        "He inflated his net worth a lot in a kind of tragic-comic way because he's so deeply insecure.",
        "It was very important to him to measure himself by his net worth.",
        "He always cared about his wealth much more than anyone else in the media did.",
        "But he used it as this thing of fascination to keep himself in play in the public eye and to get press as one of the richest people in America when he wasn't.",
        "And so it served two purposes.",
        "It served a business purpose to get him loans he might not otherwise have got - received.",
        "And the reason I think he didn't get to - go to court with that is because some of the people who were damaged by it didn't refer him to the law enforcement authorities.",
        "And then it served him on the other hand to make him an object of media fascination."

        "So what then is the relevance of Michael Cohen's testimony?",
        "O'BRIEN: I think the significance of the Michael Cohen testimony is that it lands in people's living room because of the power of television.",
        "But I also think there were other things that were raised in that testimony that came up earlier that are going to be far more of an issue than Donald Trump's wealth.",
        "I think one of them is the fact that he conspired with Michael Cohen to make a payment to Stormy Daniels while he was president in order to silence her.",
        "And he engaged in a conspiracy and a fraud to keep her quiet.",
        "That's one.",
        "The second thing is Michael Cohen added to our knowledge of a project to build a Trump Tower in Moscow that lasted almost up until Trump was elected president.",
        "And that raises issues about whether or not the president could have been compromised by a foreign power financially on his way into the White House and whether the decisions he makes around national security or foreign policy issues are compromised by his wallet.",
        "And I think those are actually the two - two of the biggest things to come out of the hearing.",
        "I think there was a moment during the hearing when Congressman Khanna of California got into a dialogue with Cohen, and he said to him, are you telling me that Donald Trump Jr. and Allen Weisselberg and President Trump jointly engaged in a criminal fraud?",
        "And Michael Cohen said, yes.",
        "That's going to be something law enforcement people are going to probe further.",
