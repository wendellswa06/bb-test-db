        "And Sam, most predictions are for a quarter point interest rate cut today from the Fed, but could this new report alter that decision from the Fed?",
        "Well, there's really no way to know for sure until the Fed makes its announcement later today.",
        "But so far there are - there are few clues as to what it's going to do other than the usual rush of predictions coming from economists.",
        "As you mentioned, most of those economists are forecasting at least a quarter point cut in interest rates.",
        "Mark Zandi with MoodysEconomy.com falls into that category.",
        "He says there is a reason today strong economic growth figures won't affect the Fed's decision, and that's because things are changing so fast in the economy.",
        "I would look at history to try to gauge which way the Fed's going to move today, because when they're setting policy today, they're thinking about the future, what the economy is going to look down the road, not what the economy did up till now.",
        "Now, Zandi says even though the GDP acts as a scoreboard for U.S.",
        "economic health, there is a lag effect, and that's the history comment.",
        "Once you look into the future, he says, the picture doesn't look so good.",
        "Much of that growth was fueled by a bump in consumer spending.",
        "And if yesterday's news that consumer confidence slipped again for the third straight month is any indication, that bump in spending isn't likely to last.",
        "Okay.",
        "So if they do cut it by a quarter point, the interest rate, will that be enough to get the economy back on track?",
        "Well, at the very least, Madeleine, it's going to please Wall Street and the markets will respond positively or at least remain somewhat steady.",
        "But I wouldn't expect a rate cut to end the housing woes anytime soon.",
        "The thinking is that a rate cut will improve banks' balance sheets, since they can charge more for their long-term loans while fattening their profits on the cheaper short term loans.",
        "But the credit crunch that's responsible for the housing downturn has much deeper roots.",
        "The big homebuilders are struggling with tightened lending standards and virtually no demand for new housing.",
        "And most buyers can't get loans."

        "A Fed rate cut isn't going to change that, and some economists say it's a matter of time before that reality catches up to consumers and begins to drag down the overall economy.",

        "That's because they're both within the 0.5 percentage-point margin to trigger that.",
        "We'll probably find something out about that tomorrow to figure out where that's going to go.",
        "And we're - if a machine recount - this is what would be ordered - happens, and the race, especially for the Senate, which right now is within this margin, is within 0.25 percentage points - really narrow - then a manual recount would be triggered, which is - this is a huge state.",
        "That's a lot of manual work to do.",

        "Bob Johnson's venture is obviously different given his founding of BET, but let's look closely at what BET promised versus what it actually delivered.",
        "When Bob Johnson started BET, he pitched it as a television station that would give black people the opportunity to get quality black sports, news, and entertainment programming.",
        "To African-Americans living in cable markets that did not or would not offer BET, he urged them to protest, to demand a television network that would treat black people with respect and dignity.",

        "Bob Johnson took that original vision and gutted it with a quickness about as soon as he recognized that he could make literally billions offering bootie shaking music videos that cost him little to nothing to put on the air.",
        "And when asked about his original vision, all of a sudden he wasn't in the game to produce quality programming for black people.",
