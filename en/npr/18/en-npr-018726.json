        "Why is that?",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, because already, African American women experience this disease uniquely.",
        "They are more likely to get breast cancer under the age of 40.",
        "They are not using - utilizing the benefits of early detection as much as other women do.",
        "They have cancers that are more - tend to be more aggressive.",
        "For example, this cancer called triple-negative breast cancer.",
        "That's about two to three times more common in African American women and that comes with a much more aggressive, life threatening type of cancer.",
        "And so if these women, if they don't start getting their mammogram at age 40, then we will have missed the opportunity, I believe, to save their lives.",
        "What about survival rates among women who are diagnosed with breast cancer, the differences between African American women and Caucasian women?",
        "Well, in the years between 1996 and 2004, for example, African American had a 77 percent survivorship, five-year survivorship compared to 90 percent among whites.",
        "So what you're saying is that because African American women are at higher risk of developing breast cancer often under the age of 40 that the recommendations by the taskforce will be sending a message that they no longer should be screened until the age of 50, and that's the risk.",
        "Yes.",
        "That's what I've been hearing this past week.",
        "We've seen a significant cancellation rate for mammograms at our hospital and...",
        "Because women are basically saying: Well, I shouldn't do this until the age of 50.",
        "That's right.",
        "Dr.",
        "Weiss, there's significant evidence to show that among women who are screened that there's a disproportionate number of African American women in this country who are not routinely tested.",
        "I mean, why will the taskforce recommendations change that anyway if this is already a problem?"

        "Well, it's going to make the problem worse because doubt has been inserted.",
        "For them to go out of their way now to get a mammogram when they may not have health insurance, to pay out of pocket for something, there's a doubtful value from what they heard this week will deter their coming forward and getting a mammogram.",
        "Some of the loudest opponents of these recommendations have been radiologists.",
        "And some critics of these opponents have said, well, look, you know, radiologists have a stake in mammography.",
        "What do you say to folks who make that argument?",
        "Over the years, he's developed this fantasy life separate from his family, from his wife, and he realizes that this fantasy life includes this wish to get away, to be somewhere else.",
        "And he thinks I was only happy one place in my life and that was in Africa.",

        "No.",

        "Eighty percent of Americans want to give the DACA kids a better life, and 80 percent of Americans want to secure our border and change a broken immigration system.",

        "So let's focus on that.",
        "How likely is a solution to DACA right now?",
        "A solution to DACA seemed very unlikely this week.",
        "One option that they have is they could - Congress could pass another short-term spending bill.",
        "We've been seeing them pass a lot of short-term spending bills, and the House is already preparing to pass something that would give them more time to keep working on a DACA deal and allow them to do a long-term spending bill perhaps sometime in February.",
        "So that seems to be the most likely path at this point.",

        "Well, it's very hard to know exactly what the White House wants, and that's part of what the issue is here.",
        "So Democrats say that they came up with this bipartisan solution - it was worked out by a group of six senators - Republicans and Democrats - that would've addressed those four pillars that we heard the White House talking about last week - dealing with immigration, dealing with the DACA recipients and controlling some of the flow of people through other immigration programs.",
        "Right.",
        "Now...",
        "This is the deal that they brought to the White House when these inflammatory remarks were made.",
        "Right.",

        "Bob Goodlatte from Virginia has come up with a plan for House Republicans that would go even further than that.",
        "It would crack down on sanctuary cities, and it would require companies to use what's known as E-Verify to check the legal status of the people that they employ."

        "So - but the president said he was on board with the plan - the bipartisan plan that was brought to him.",

        "Well, he was on board with the idea of a bipartisan plan, but he hadn't signed off on this specifically.",
        "And then we saw him bring in people from the hard-line side of the right who got him very excited and reminded him that he had made promises to his base.",
        "And Republicans are shifting here from what was seen as a bipartisan deal to something that they might have to pass with Republican votes only, which can be a tremendous challenge if it gets to that point, given their narrow majority.",

        "Explain the deal here.",
        "Yeah, well, you're right.",
        "The Olympics are supposed to be about sports, and that's what South Korea thought they were getting when they had gotten a sort of agreement in principle from North Korea to send a delegation to Pyeongchang, where the Olympics are going to be held.",
        "But instead, Pyongyang says, no, we don't want to talk about the athletes just yet; we first want to talk about an art troupe, a propaganda band.",
        "And South Korea right now is not really in a position to want to say no. They are keen to get dialogue moving in any way, so I think they went along with it.",
        "And lo and behold, after a couple of hours of talks on Monday, there is a 140-member orchestra coming south to South Korea to perform.",
        "At the Olympics or in a different venue?",

        "And, you know, when we talk about an orchestra, there are indeed woodwinds, and strings and brass, but if you go and look on YouTube - and you can watch any of the performances - you'll see electric guitars.",
