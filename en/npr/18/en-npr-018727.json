        "Well, you know, South Korea raised it at the - yeah.",
        "They raised it at the first discussion last week, and North Korea said, we don't want to talk about that, and so it's not on the agenda anymore.",
        "So what we know from the last year or so of confrontation, there are more sanctions on North Korea.",
        "There are more threats, plenty of talk of nuclear buttons, actual talk of music and the Olympics and so forth.",

        "I mean, so no one - none of the neighbors you talked to had any suspect that there was something weird going on?",
        "No, and that's what's strange about the size, as well.",
        "I spoke with one neighbor who had a friend who had the same exact floor plan - a four-bedroom, three-bathroom home - and he expressed shock at the concept that 13 children and their two parents would even have the space to live there.",
        "But just like I said before, there's a neighborhood watch group.",
        "There's a Facebook group where all the residents and homeowners can get together, and talk and let each other know about what's going on.",

        "We don't at the moment.",

        "One of the interesting things that we've begin (ph) to uncover is that it looks like three times since 2011, they had renewed their vows at the Elvis chapel in Las Vegas.",
        "So we were actually able to obtain a video of one of their marriage renewals that had been posted publicly on the chapel's website - so a lot of questions, I guess, about the fact that they had done that so many times.",
        "I know that they had also filed bankruptcy in 2011 - so just trying to put all the pieces together and see who knew what when.",
        "Right, it's still very early in this investigation.",
