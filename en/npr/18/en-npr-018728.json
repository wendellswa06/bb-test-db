        "So, Ellis Hock is in this place where people have been corrupted and where they really want to get away, and they've learned that someone like Ellis Hock is money on two legs.",
        "So, it seems that Ellis Hock has really two Malawis in his consciousness.",
        "There's the Malawi of really his selective memory, this place where he came of age in the 1960s, and then there's the place that nearly destroys him in the present as a 60-some-year-old man.",
        "I wonder which of these versions of Malawi has stayed with you over the years.",

        "It's silly to think that because you have a dream for a person or a place or you have hopes that those hopes are going to be fulfilled.",
        "Probably they won't be fulfilled.",

        "They're not the hopes of those people.",

        "The Malawi that stays in my mind, well, there are two.",
        "There's the old place that I knew that had a population of maybe a million or a million and a half, and then there's the present-day with a million orphans and huge unsustainable population, of deforestation and tyranny.",

        "Indeed, I think there's a real scenario where President Trump does both of those things at the same time.",
        "That is to say, pull out our troops 'cause he doesn't want to be in a mess on the ground and spending money and getting involved in a civil war but also, you know, bombing from far away, which is lower cost and lower risk.",
        "Indeed, you could even argue that if we're going to start undertaking airstrikes in Syria, that you could make a case you don't want troops on the ground.",
        "That would be vulnerable and could drag you in.",
        "So there's, like I say, a real chance that that's where we end up - doing the airstrikes but also pulling out on the ground at the same time.",
        "Last thing - I should just note - today is day one on the job for President Trump's new national security adviser John Bolton.",
        "What is your sense of where he lands on what to do about Syria?",
        "Yeah, one reason I think it's highly likely that the United States is going to act militarily here - it's not just because I and others think it's the right thing to do.",
        "But with John Bolton starting this week in the White House, to have the president warn on Twitter that there's a big price to pay and having made clear that we're not going to tolerate use of weapons of mass destruction and wanting to signal that the administration wants to stand up to Iran - after all that, to not act in Bolton's first week on the job would really undermine everything the administration is trying to do about showing that it's tough and willing to stand up to adversaries.",
