        "Well, that sense of realism maybe - got went a little too far, Dr. Oz?",
        "Oh, you know, it's an excellent point because working within a hospital, especially in an emergency room, really is choreographed chaos.",
        "And at the same time when it's done elegantly, becomes a dance.",
        "And so that little - that fine line between, when the test isn't done in a timely fashion, you're struggling with it, is sort of what jazzes you up in a way.",
        "You realize that you're going to make your own breaks for the people who trust you with their lives.",
        "And in an emergency room setting, that is what you do for 12 hours.",
        "It cultivates a certain type of personality.",
        "It's a little different from what you want to have if you are going into ophthalmology, for example, one with a sort of more organized pattern to your day.",
        "Mark, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it.",

        "Hi.",
        "Thanks for having me on your show.",
        "I'm a doc, I'm a relatively young doc, and \"\"ER\"\" was at its height of its popularity when I was in medical school.",
        "And the first few years in medical school are all classroom work, and we used to watch \"\"ER\"\" kind of almost all of us just dying to get in there and do the real stuff.",
        "And I actually stopped watching \"\"ER\"\" once I actually got in to do real medicine because I thought it was pretty not accurate for what a medical student goes through, which is what Carter's role was.",
        "I remember, you know, Carter getting called in to pump the heart when the chest was flailed open.",
        "You know, it was really disillusioning for a lot of us who went in thinking that \"\"ER\"\" was going to be just like what we did, and really kind of a disappointment for me.",
        "You know, just to defend the show for a second, there are of course very different emergency room experiences around the country.",
        "Where I was practicing, as I mentioned, 1986 which was the year of my internship, we had 2,200 homicides in the, you know, near city area and, you know, led the nation - we're thankfully down to about 600 now, but I opened a chest almost every night, and I was an intern.",
        "And the medical students would have to take over, doing some of the work on these people who were almost always mortally injured.",
        "And it became not unusual to have a medical student playing a fairly critical role when they were in their fourth year.",
        "So, although that is a very different experience today, in fact it's one of the most important and telling changes in medicine is the limited amount of experience medical students and residents now have as, you know, as independent practitioners, which of course is if you're out there listening, and you're a patient, is a good thing because you don't have people practicing on you."

        "But the negative is that it delays the maturation of physicians to the process because now you've got to be a bit more senior before people begin to trust you.",
        "But - and you know, in a war zone environment, which it was like at New York Presbyterian, and in many ways in, of course, the, you know, the fictional County General Hospital in Chicago where \"\"ER\"\" is set, is more similar to where I was practicing than many ERs are today.",
        "Well, Amanda, there is - excuse me, Karen, there is this sense of - there's a great passage in the \"\"Simple Art of Murder\"\" by the great detective storywriter Raymond Chandler who says - advises people who want to write these stories, when in doubt, have a man burst into the room with a gun in his hand.",
        "And you always have the feeling that the scriptwriters on \"\"ER\"\" said that when in doubt, have somebody shout, clear!",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "It's just that I don't think it reflects the vast majority of ER sites in the country.",
        "And for a young medical student at the time who - some of whom probably applied to medical schools to be like that.",
        "It's just not accurate.",

        "Yes.",
        "I was in the - been an emergency room nurse for about 20 years.",
        "And I can tell you that the side stories, the relationships between the nurses and the doctors were just as accurate.",
        "The ER I've worked in, I worked in a level one trauma center and in other smaller ERs, and you develop close friendships with the doctors that you work with.",
        "And a lot of times they would turn into romances.",
        "And Dr. Oz, the war zone atmosphere that you're describing, well that engenders very intense relationships.",
        "It does.",
        "And stress, in general, tends to do that, especially among men.",
        "That's one of the reasons they do risky things because it's correlated with some of the drivers of romance.",
        "And certainly, in this kind of a setting, when you're physically interacting with each other and you're going through some big ups and downs as you try to save lives and sometimes succeed, it will pull people together.",
        "I want to just - just on that point raised, another issue that perhaps other callers may have noticed, but for many Americans, well, on \"\"ER\"\" was the first time that they began to have their expectations changed about what a doctor was, you know, because they were female doctors.",
        "At the time, I remember that so frequently the female residents will be called nurses by the patients and of course, you know, that would be a disconnect when they found out they were the physician running their show.",
        "There are African- American doctors, Asian doctors, gay and lesbian doctors.",
        "And I also think the role of nurses was clarified in the show a little bit more, because nurses really run the show.",
        "They're so critically important, not just in emergency rooms, but in hospitals in most facets because they're your primary caregiver.",
        "That people began to respect what that position meant, same for, by the way, for physician's assistant and all of the other folks who play a role in making the system run.",
        "Georgia, when you leave the ER, does other medical practice seem a little pale in comparison?",
        "Indeed it does.",
        "We have to find a way to be gentler, kinder person.",
        "In trauma center, you tend to be going at a fast pace.",
        "And the real gift and the real magic in that profession is to put the patient first and make their experience as good as you possibly can.",
        "That was the real lesson for me in all those years, not - I wasn't in the ER for me, but I was in it for them.",

        "My father is a hospital administrator, and because of that - and I think also because of his Navy background - I was conscripted into medical service at a very young age.",
        "I've been working in medicine for 17 years now.",
        "But he's at a rural hospital with about 16 beds, and since going off on my own I've done small places, I've worked in big, 700 bed places.",

        "Thanks very much for the call.",
        "Again, you're talking about the patient's expectations of doctors.",

        "People can read a lot into symptoms.",
        "One of the things that's most fascinating when you go to a medical school, and every medical school class experiences is this, is you diagnose each other with the rarest of illnesses, almost every one of them are fatal.",
        "So the folks going through this experience go through the same thing we go through as we first are exposed to health care.",
        "And by the way, I think the - in its essence, that's what was so cool about \"\"ER\"\" for me.",
        "That for many people, an emergency room experience was never going to happen in their lifetime.",
        "And here you had the opportunity to glimpse what it's like to actually be in the trenches.",
        "And, of course, with that comes the exact, same very human response: you diagnose yourself with illnesses you don't have, you - but you also realize that you could become the world expert on your body, because the people who are taking care of you may not have read the same textbooks that you think they're reading from.",
        "In other words, we read books thinking you're going to come to us with organized illnesses, and you don't as a patient.",
        "If you want to be clear with us and help us do better for you, you better take a more active role.",
        "And if that's the single most telling result of this program and other medical programs that are on the air, then it was worth watching all of them.",
        "And are you going to take a timeout, two hours, on April 2nd to watch the finale?",

        "I might as well end with it.",
