        "He was the head of the Christian Coalition.",
        "He's now running for lieutenant governor of Georgia.",
        "And there was a recent Senate report, a pretty scathing report, detailing Reed's dealings with the infamous lobbyist Jack Abramoff.",
        "Tell us about that.",
        "That's right.",
        "Well, Ralph Reed hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing, but what came out in this report is that he was paid $5.3 million to contact his grassroots evangelical friends to inveigh and weigh in against gambling in various locations, and it turns out what he was doing is pushing against gambling on the one hand, but he was being hired by Abramoff to - in the interests of his gaming clients, these Indian tribes that owned existing casinos.",
        "So the Christian evangelicals who Reed was using were actually working against their own interests.",
        "Reed says he didn't know what was going on, and the committee report doesn't suggest that he did, but it is a situation in which you had evangelicals working, essentially without knowing it, for the gambling interests they are so against.",
        "And it doesn't cast a good light on Ralph Reed for the evangelicals, right?",
        "I mean, they may be looking at him askance now?",
        "Absolutely, that's exactly right.",
        "Evangelicals have always, in the last 30-40 years that there's been this rise of this voting block, there has been a portion that's always worried about getting involved in politics because there is something about politics that is worldly and debasing, and this is an example of that, and so there have been many who have argued, even at the height of the evangelical power in the political process, who have argued, Look, we should stick to the local, changing hearts one at a time, and in our churches, and just not get involved in the political business because, inevitably, it's going to lead to this kind of business."

        "That's right.",
        "The old-line political leaders have lost some standing in the evangelical movement, and now when I talk to people who are deeply religious people, they talk about pastors like TD Jakes or Rick Warren, that's the Saddleback Church in California, who are working on big, global issues, and they're not so involved in the gay marriage and abortion and school prayer debates that go on in Washington.",
        "What are these big issues?",
        "Well, the big issues they're working on are poverty, and not just in the United States, but globally, AIDS in Africa, and also now a group of evangelicals are working on global warming.",
        "They say that one of the things God calls us to do is to be good caretakers of His earth, and that's caused a bit of a split, or at least a public spat within some of the - or among some of the evangelical leaders, as those who say global warming is an important issue get into an argument with others who say that takes focus away from issues like abortion or stopping gay marriage or making sure there can be prayer in schools.",
        "President Bush has always been a favorite among evangelicals, and his personal story of religious conversion appealing to them.",
