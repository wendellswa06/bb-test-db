        "Mike Huckabee, the Governor of Arkansas, used to be a Baptist minister, and so he would be one that would certainly be a favorite.",
        "The problem is he's a big long shot for the Presidency.",
        "Well, is it a possibility that the evangelicals will just not be as strongly aligned with the GOP?",
        "This is the great question, and there are a couple of options.",
        "Either evangelicals can decide that they'll be sort of transactional, that they'll go along with a frontrunner that they may not really love but they still want to be in a part of the conversation.",
        "Some may just leave and not be involved in politics at all, or some may back these kind of long-shot candidates like Huckabee, and they'll participate in the process and they'll get their man some votes, but in the end not determine who gets the nomination.",
        "But how that all shakes out remains to be seen.",
        "Opinion and analysis from John Dickerson.",
        "He's chief political correspondent for the online magazine, Slate.",

        "The news this week that both Delta and Northwest Airlines declared bankruptcy was not unexpected.",
        "Bankruptcy almost seems basic to the airline industry.",
        "The list of carriers that are or have been in Chapter 11 includes United, US Airways, ATA, Continental and the late TWA, which actually filed three times before disappearing for good.",
        "The explainer team at the online magazine Slate wondered why airlines go bankrupt so often.",
        "Here with the answer is Slate's Andy Bowers.",
        "Mainly because they can't compete with younger rivals.",
        "Airlines almost never went bankrupt in the old days, when the federal board controlled every aspect of the industry, including ticket prices and routes.",
        "But after deregulation in 1978, so-called legacy carriers began facing lean and hungry upstart competitors.",
        "The legacy airlines, such as United and Northwest, pay more to fly their planes than newcomers like JetBlue and Southwest.",
        "They tend to have more veteran employees who earn higher salaries and more retirees who get pension benefits.",
        "Their union contracts, based on years of negotiation, often include more curbs on how much each pilot or mechanic can be asked to work.",
        "Given these higher costs, the legacy carriers have more difficulty competing on ticket prices.",
        "A history of credit troubles also makes it more difficult for legacy carriers to guard against oil price hikes by locking in guaranteed contracts.",
        "Airlines seem to go bankrupt more often than any other business, but you'll find a similar pattern in other deregulated industries, like telecommunications, and in commodity industries.",
        "After all, steel is steel, so a customers just look for the best price.",
        "How does bankruptcy help an airline?",
        "For one thing, a bankruptcy judge can impose a new contract and new wage cuts on a union, approve the transfer of pension obligations to the federal government and agree to eliminate some debts altogether.",
        "That said, bankruptcy carries very high legal and other costs, and airlines do what they can to avoid it."

        "Well, they did for a while because the next 87 flights actually were all successful flights.",
        "But it wasn't entirely a cultural change, it was also partly luck because actually during that time as well, other problems, not o-rings, but other problems like o-rings emerged.",
        "The classic, of course, was foam falling of the external fuel tank of the space shuttles during life off.",
        "That was not supposed to happened.",
        "It was outside what was allowable but people said, well, it keeps happening and hitting the shuttle and nothing bad happens except little digs that we can replace later during repair so let's not worry about it.",
        "Well, as we all know, three years ago, the space shuttle Columbia had one of these pieces of foam hit the leading edge of one of its wings and that led to the second space shuttle disaster.",
        "The same cultural problem within NASA.",
        "Now is this a cultural problem that is unique in any way to NASA or is it something broader, something about human nature?",
        "It's definitely human nature.",
        "I mean, if you drive down the road, you wouldn't worry about a little sound you hear in your car figuring, well, I'm used to that sounds, how big a deal is it?",
        "People tend to react to what they're used to as opposed to saying, we don't fully understand this, let's get down to the bottom of it.",
        "And it's partly a function of the fact that the space shuttle is so enormously complicated that you can't ever expect it to be a hundred percent safe.",
        "The question is, is it gonna be 98 percent safe in which case you're gonna have some accidents over the life of the program or 99.9 percent safe in which case maybe you will get lucky and not have an accident?",
        "What is going on today at NASA to get to that 99.9 percent level?",
        "I think what's happening is they are going to fly as few shuttle flights as they can possibly manage and then retire the space shuttle.",
        "Because it is fundamentally not a vehicle that's ever gonna be terribly safe.",
        "It was designed to do too many things at once.",
        "Its designed to carry large amounts of freight and people and it was a compromised machine and as a result, the people are close to the rockets and its just inherently dangerous.",
        "How soon are we likely to see people in space again?",
        "Well, the next space shuttle flight is scheduled for May of this year if they can get it fixed again.",
        "And the space shuttle is supposed to fly through the year 2010 so the shuttle does not have very many flights left in it.",
        "The next generation spacecraft is gonna be in 2012, 2014; some place out there, maybe later.",
        "So there's gonna be a gap in having human beings go in to space, at least on American spacecraft.",
        "Let's remember the Russians have been using essentially the same technology since the 1960s and it works.",
        "After the Challenger accident, NASA's image took a hard blow and then after the Columbia accident, more and more questions.",
        "What is the state of the agency as far as the way it's looked upon by leaders and by the American public?",
        "Well, I think what NASA has going for it is that there is a strong public interest in some space program and also a strong commercial interest, frankly.",
        "The aerospace contractors are always encouraging Congress to fund these things and so on.",
        "And let's not forget the wonderful, wonderful things that NASA does with unmanned space programs.",
        "We just launched a probe to Pluto and we'll have to wait a few years to see the results of that, but we have a fabulous spacecraft orbiting Saturn right now, taking wonderful pictures, dropped a probe onto one of the moons of Saturn, we have spacecraft approaching Mars, still crawling around on Mars, so that's got a lot of good things to point to also and a lot of public support for those activities."
