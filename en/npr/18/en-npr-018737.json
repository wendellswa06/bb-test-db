        "And what about the prosecution?",
        "They can't use social media, is that right?",
        "Or what is their relationship to social media?",
        "That's right, for the most part.",
        "Because they are the state, they are the government, they are prohibited from engaging in social media in the ways that the defense are.",
        "So they can not actively put out their opinions, they can't do anything to the extent that the defense can do.",
        "They can certainly go on social media and monitor traffic and pay attention to what's being said.",
        "But they can't have a voice.",
        "So what do both sides, both the defense and prosecution, what is it that they can glean from the conversations they might be tracking on social media?",
        "Well, we saw it a little bit in the Casey Anthony trial.",
        "What we're talking about is it gives - it's almost jury consultation.",
        "It gives them a chance - the defense in this case - to use the attitudes, the opinions that are coming up on, say, Twitter, as a barometer for what jurors may actually be concerned about, what questions jurors may have.",
        "And so they can throw all kinds of information about the case or evidence out there and see the reaction.",
        "And they use that reaction to shape their argument - and from the opening statement, all the way through the closing.",
        "Yeah, what about - the prosecution can't use social media, but what about Trayvon Martin's supports?",
        "They can, and they are using social media, too, aren't they?",
        "They certainly are, and they're - you know, that side of it was the side that first went to social media and drummed up the national outcry to this.",
        "So Trayvon Martin's parents, certainly his mother has been very active on social media.",
        "The parents' lawyers have been very active on social media.",
        "And there's still an enormous sort of engine of support for Trayvon Martin and for - and against, rather, Zimmerman as being guilty.",
        "So it certainly is going both ways, but I think from a legal perspective, the advantage, perhaps, is on the side of the defense here.",
        "And so just to go back to where we were in the beginning, are we hearing specific questions about potential jurors' use of social media and sophistication about social media?",
        "Yeah, what did you learn from that situation that you had there, where you found out afterwards, I guess by polling the jury, you found out afterwards?"

        "That's the goal.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Social media, the Internet in general, it's mainly focused on news.",
        "Do you watch the news?",
        "If so, how much?",
        "How do you take your news, through the Web, through the media - excuse me, through television, through newspapers?",
        "And then beyond that, if they find jurors or potential jurors who are frequent Internet users, then they start asking whether or not they know about Twitter, whether or not they're on it or Facebook.",
        "And also, this case is a very racially charged case.",
        "How are both sides addressing the issue of race during this phase of the trial, during this jury selection phase?",
        "It hasn't come up yet.",
        "One of the potential jurors who was questioned today, it's an African-American male, he actually talked about the - the fact that he actually was quite disappointed and disapproving of the - what he called, sort of, the racializing of this case, certainly by the side of civil rights leaders like Al Sharpton and others who were calling for the arrest of Zimmerman.",
        "Beyond that, the lawyers haven't really touched it, but certainly, certainly race has been sort of bandied about throughout the chatter over the last two days on social media.",
        "Yeah, so that is the racial aspects of this, you are seeing it very much if you're monitoring the social media on this trial?",
        "Oh yeah, it's coming - it's flying in every direction.",
        "Yeah, and that's been right since the beginning of this, that this entire case became public.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You know, there was an interesting sort of turn of the tide to some degree.",
        "Initially when this shooting first happened, there was an outcry across races, across ages, you name it.",
        "It was really about, you know, parents in particular, identifying with the loss of a child in this kind of way.",
        "But when civil rights activists got involved, when Al Sharpton got involved, there was a turn.",
        "Many people who didn't appreciate it or who have perhaps preconceived notions about civil rights leaders like Sharpton, didn't appreciate his getting involved.",
        "I think his presence alone gives the impression that this becomes a race issue, and that turned some people off."

        "Is that starting to happen in other trials, as well?",
        "Or is this really kind of unprecedented in the Zimmerman trial?",
        "Well, I think there's a lot of first in this case, and the sheer volume of social media that's being bandied about is something that's new, just because it is a high-profile case.",
        "But one of the things is that what I'm seeing is the need in every single trial, right up front, to tell people that they cannot engage in any kind of social media research, and will they have a problem with that.",
        "And I've actually seen people get excused because they say right to the judge I cannot follow that order, I'm going to have to look, I'm just curious, I'm going to Google, I'm going to do this and that.",
        "So in that way things are different.",
        "But the fact that they've raised $400,000 for the defense, that's a new thing.",

        "And then also the number of signatures on the petition.",
        "I read someplace after the shooting and before the arrest that there were 10,000 signatures an hour being generated on the media, on the Internet, to arrest George Zimmerman.",
        "Well, you know, widespread media exposure has always been something that lawyers have to be careful of when they're selecting a jury.",
        "So this just adds to that, it seems like, it just complicates matters even more.",
        "It really does and it's difficult because all of a sudden you have a situation where people want to get on the jury, as opposed to the typical scenario, which is how do I get off, what do I say to get off.",
        "And so it changes the complexion because it's really difficult to ascertain why people want to get on the jury."
