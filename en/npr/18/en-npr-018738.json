        "Nothing makes me feel better.",
        "But in regards to the case, I'm Italian, Vito Corleone, and many times we have - you know, we've had a certain case where somebody left the gun and took the cannolis, and they left the actual piece of evidence there in the vehicle.",
        "And I had to make sure I got all Italians on that jury or it was going to be a situation that could have got out of control.",
        "All right, well thanks so much for your call, Vito, and I'm going to ask Karen to respond to something you were saying.",
        "He brought up the question of race, Karen, and that's - I know you've dealt with trials where race is a big issue.",

        "Well, one thing is that - what I don't know is if they addressed it in the jury questionnaire.",
        "My guess is they did because that can be a place where people tend to give their opinions a little bit more freely than if they have to actually verbalize them to a judge sitting up there in a black robe.",
        "But I haven't read anything about questions about race in the questionnaire.",
        "But I would bet that they are in there.",
        "And some examples are: Have you ever had a problem with somebody of a different race?",
        "You know, do you tend to join social groups?",
        "If so, what are they?",
        "Do you contribute to the ACLU?",
        "Do you have any involvement in racial issues or research of something like that?",
        "I mean, there's just a lot - a stream of questions that they can try to get at people's, you know, familiarity and comfort level of racial issues.",
        "Tell us about a case you worked with that dealt with race and how you handled it?",
        "Well, there's so many.",
        "I wouldn't even know where to begin.",
        "But one that got a lot of attention around here was the case of the Oakland Riders.",
        "And the Oakland Riders were police officers who were accused of profiling African-Americans in parts of Oakland and actually arresting them and beating them up.",
        "And it became an incredibly polarized case racially and got a lot of attention around here, and it just became a matter of asking questions.",
        "And certainly familiarity does not necessarily mean partiality, but it's just a matter of digging deeper and finding out what people's views and attitudes are.",
        "Can you ever really be sure that you've got the right person on a jury, or you've gotten the right people on a jury I guess?",
        "Well, you can't really be sure until the verdict.",
        "Nobody's got a crystal ball.",
        "However, it really comes down to asking questions and asking a lot of questions to really get at the heart of people's attitudes and beliefs.",
        "And it's not easy, and it's important to not rely so much on stereotypes but really, really keep digging.",
        "And do people ever try and fool you, and can you sort of suss that out, as well?",
        "Absolutely, and again that goes back to jurors wanting to be on a high-profile case and saying that they hadn't read anything, they didn't know anything about it and come to find out, you know, they take two newspapers every day and watch the news six times or whatever the numbers are.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Let's take another call.",

        "Hi.",
        "I'm a defense attorney in Houston, and one thing I wanted to make clear is that the process is so important that I tell my clients literally half the battle is won or lost at jury selection.",
        "And going back to what your guest just said, very often times, we do find ourselves, because we have very limited amount of time to get through voir dire, we find ourselves falling back on stereotypes and going against everything we've ever been taught about don't read a book by its cover, et cetera, et cetera.",
        "Conventional wisdom, sometimes - as an example, one of my cases would tell you - I had a young, attractive female who was accused of assault - would tell you don't put other young, attractive girls on that jury because they're generally not sympathetic to each other.",
        "So I picked an older, middle-aged woman who turned out to poison my entire jury, and the case went against us.",
        "But understand that in most cases, we don't have days to go through these jury questionnaires and all day to talk to the jurors.",
        "They give us roughly a minute, sometimes less, to a minute and a half per juror to try to suss out what this person believes and what their core belief system is.",
        "And it's very, very difficult to do without falling back on stereotypes and conventional wisdom.",
        "I speak to all of my jurors after every, every case, every case I've ever tried, and I've tried over 50.",
        "It's essential to speak to them afterwards, I feel, this is my personal opinion, because it will bring that to the fore.",
        "And what I learned from that case is what, you know, they teach us at every CLE and every conference that we have, is you have to get the jurors to start talking more.",
        "And that's the key is if you can get them to start talking and expressing their opinions and get them to engage you, then you can find out OK, is this somebody who I thought was going to fall into a certain stereotype but believes something entirely different, or does not?",
        "And a lot of time that rides on the judge.",
        "The judge will only give you half an hour or an hour to cover a panel of, you know, 24 to 60 people.",
        "Yeah, thanks so much for your call, Eddie, that was very interesting.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And Karen, let me follow up.",
        "Just, you know, one of the things that I'm getting from this is that you have to be a pretty astute judge of character, it seems to me.",
        "And how do you develop that skill?",
        "I mean...?",
        "Well, again it sounds - I sound like a broken record, but it goes back to asking the right questions.",
        "And what's tricky and what the last caller just mirrored is that sometimes you don't get a lot of time to do that.",
        "And you can't just start in with hey, how do you feel about the death penalty, or, you know, are you racist?",
        "You have to really kind of massage the issues and get some comfort, you know, socially with the person that the attorney's talking to.",
        "And it's very, very tricky and especially when there's time limits, and there typically are, less so in a high-profile case, but that's a giant issue."

        "I just wanted to add to the last caller said if it - one bad juror can taint the whole pool.",
        "So it becomes incredibly important.",
        "But what I always find, I do civil law, I do a lot of civil defense now, I used to do some civil plaintiff side, is that when you start running out of challenges, and you get down to the last two or three challenges, say, left, depending on what state you're in, or if you're in the federal arm.",
        "And you're looking at the back of the room, and you're thinking wow, it's kind of tradeoff between what I see here and what I think I see in the back of the room and what I think I see of the limited information we've got.",
        "So that's where it gets really dicey.",
        "My personal horror story was when I picked a police officer in a whistle-blower case.",
        "I thought he would be very law and order, et cetera.",
        "And I was getting - it was in that tricky area where I wasn't sure what was left in the jury pool.",
        "And it turned out the opposite, that he was just anti-plaintiffs in general no matter what.",
        "And he tainted at least, you know, two or three others, like, to see if we were progressing.",
        "So that was a mistake that I made that you can easily make.",
        "So that's the lesson I learned was I tend to head toward more neutrals.",
        "Now, I do less stereotyping.",
        "And I tend to - I'd rather get a neutral that I can move once they get on the panel than take someone who's already, you know, in a corner before they get on the panel.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so I guess Karen said before you really don't know if you've picked the right jury until the decision comes in, and it goes in your favor.",
        "But have you sort of finished with jury selection ever and thought I did it this time, this is right and then...",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "...been proved correct or been proved wrong?",
        "I don't know.",
        "It's both ways.",
        "You'll second-guess yourself for years on things like that.",
        "And if you win, of course, you forget everything because perfect selection.",
        "But every time I've been surprised.",
        "Every time I've thought I had a sure thing or that I knew someone was against my side, I've been mistaken.",
        "It switches up.",
        "People change.",
        "Stereotypes don't really fit.",
        "So there's always that give and take.",
        "And you never really feel 100 percent convinced you nailed it, unless you win.",
        "If you get an 8-0 jury then you think did something right.",
        "But most of us like to think that we did the work during the trial (unintelligible) in the selection at that point.",
        "So that's just vanity."
