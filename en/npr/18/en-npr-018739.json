        "And so we had held, really throughout the trial that, you know, they did a survey ahead of time in the small community where the case was tried.",
        "They also helped us with the actual jury selection.",
        "And what was wonderful about the jury consultants at that time was we went in and I had a co-counselor on the case.",
        "He went in with the assumption that we were going to want to have on this case people whom themselves have been in some way related to domestic violence as victims at least.",
        "And the consultants told us that was absolutely the last thing we wanted.",
        "We actually were looking for an ideal juror they said at the time, and that was a traditional male and particularly someone who had been in the military who understood about self-defense.",
        "And so we - anyway, we had a long jury selection process.",
        "We had a great judge, and I think it was mentioned earlier that the judge that you have makes a huge difference in jury selection.",
        "We had a great judge, who gave us a lot of leeway.",
        "We filed motions ahead of time, and were able to get actual in-chamber selection for part of the process because we had delicate questions to ask each potential juror.",
        "So I mean that was pretty unheard of at the time in the late '70s.",
        "And we were very fortunate to have them.",
        "They were instrumental in helping us get an acquittal for our client.",
        "And why did they say that a victim would be the last person you would want as a juror?",
        "Yeah.",
        "They said that - for one thing, if you have a victim who has herself - and I say her because most of the time it is a woman that's the victim of domestic violence, at least at the adult level.",
        "And so if she has herself been a victim and then has been able to get out of the situation, she may or may not but you don't want to take the chance.",
        "She may be even more judgmental to somebody who for one reason or another stayed in a relationship, had to stay in the relationship, went back to the relationship, which is what we had in our situation, sometimes willingly, sometimes unwillingly because she married this guy a number of times.",
        "It was quite an incredible case.",
        "But, you know, you just - because you couldn't take the chance that that judgment - that extra judgment would be there.",
