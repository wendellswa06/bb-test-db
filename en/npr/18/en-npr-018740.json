        "In the 19th century, science was, in itself, not so much a profession, but pursued by gentlemen of independent means - for example, Charles Darwin.",
        "But with - especially after World War II, and as wars often do create new stimuli for the advancements of science, it took on a different coloration in this country, beginning, I think, especially in the 1970s.",
        "Whether at that time perhaps it was part of the reaction and the complicities involved with things such as the Vietnam War, the revelation of less than integrity by the Catholic Church, some journalistic fraud that brought to its knees for the time such institutions as the New York Post - or the New York Times or the Washington Post, scientists, too, increasingly bent the rules in order to achieve the endpoint of such ambition, namely fame, celebrity and money.",

        "And when he was called up by this researcher to present his findings, on the way up to the 11th-floor offices, in the elevator, he took out his black felt-tip pen and discolored the white fur of the laboratory mice he was going to present to his senior mentor.",
        "That was readily discovered and brought embarrassment to the senior researcher - not only the junior associate, but to the institution itself, of course - so that painting the mouse has, in fact, become a phrase to generically apply to fraudulent cases.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number, talking with Dr. Morton Meyers, author of \"\"Prize Fight: The Race and the Rivalry to be the First in Science.\"\" An interesting title, \"\"Prize Fight,\"\" because it does sometimes come down to getting punched out, doesn't it?",
        "There's a case in your book of...",
        "There's an infamous case where, in the 1920s, the pursuit of the chemical messenger for the pancreas that regulates sugar metabolism - ultimately known as insulin - resulted in fisticuffs between the people involved.",

        "He was given some support by the department chairman at the time in Toronto.",
        "But with the aid of a very talented younger associated, he ultimately - under very difficult physical conditions - finally elaborated the hormone.",
        "But the administrator of the department, the chairman, began to marginalize the physician, the researcher, and to take credit upon himself.",
        "And that led to a series of blows that have become legendary now in the history of modern science."

        "And I'm thinking of the scandal over who discovered the HIV - the AIDS virus, who got credit for that.",
        "Exactly.",
        "That required the intervention of, at the time, President Ronald Reagan and the prime minister of France, Jacques Chirac, because researchers in Paris at the Pasteur Institute were in a stunning rivalry with Robert Gallo at the National Cancer Institute as to identify the virus that was the cause of AIDS.",
        "And that simmered for many years, with leaks to the press and expressed antagonisms and rather overt bitterness, so that because of national honor, as well as the royalties that such identification would accrue to each nation, it was finally resolved with a handshake between Reagan and Chirac to share the royalties and share the honor.",
        "The honor, eventually, by the Nobel Prize, the recognition was given to the Frenchman, Luc Montagnier, who won the Nobel Prize finally in 2010.",

        "Yes, exactly.",
        "In fact, in following any popular books that detail scientific advances over the last hundred years, it was the double-helix by Watson that exposed to the public for the first time all the shenanigans and the lust for recognition and the devious methods that can be used by researchers behind the scenes.",
        "It was an explosive proclamation of the human element motivating much of research.",
        "My book maybe feebly carries on that idea in terms of revealing the passions and the stratagems that are used by researchers again for the prize, going after the prize.",

        "Well, Victor, this raises, of course, the basic question of what would be the institutional policy for that, and it varies from institution to institution.",
        "But following the explosion of cases of scientific misconduct from the 1970s, up until yesterday, various institutions have established a form of a code of ethics or institutional review.",
        "The problems with it, though, are the disparate nature of that kind of response.",
        "Certainly, some consistency would be recommended.",
        "Due process has to be preserved, of course.",
        "And the senior researcher, in these instances, often tries to preserve his own sovereignty and concern for the institution that may delay any investigation.",

        "Aren't there some cases, many cases like that?",
        "Yes, I think there are.",
        "And that really reflects some of the flaws in the bedrock of peer review for the scientific enterprise.",
        "Peer review often overlooks some major advances, and this does not lead to recognition of those cases.",
        "The first major one probably occurred in the 19th century, and that's represented by Dmitri Mendeleev, who of course established the periodic table of elements, which is recognized as the major contribution to pattern recognition in all of science.",
        "He - any recognition of his work lingered for decades.",
        "He was finally proposed for the Nobel Prize in 1905, virtually at the beginning of the Nobel Prizes, and again in the following year.",
        "But it was never awarded to him.",
        "Lise Meitner, who was instrumental in defining nuclear fission, was overlooked.",
        "Oswald Avery at the Rockefeller Institute, working on pneumococcal bacteria, came to realize that the hereditary material is not proteins, but rather nucleic acids.",
        "He as overlooked, and to most people, that's recognized as the greatest oversight by the Nobel Committee.",
        "But resistant - but to express - for a scientific researcher to express his or her displeasure over not being considered for an award only rarely comes to public awareness.",
        "And an example of that is represented by the case of MRI, where following the recognition by the Nobel Committee of Paul Lauterbur for how to figure out how to image through that process winning the Nobel Prize in 2003 was promptly advertised by Raymond Damadian, his rival, bitter rival for 30 years, took out a series of full-page advertisements in the New York Times, the Washington Post, London newspapers, Swedish newspapers, all with declamations against the Nobel Prize, asking for a re-evaluation and so forth.",
        "That kind of public protest is not kindly taken, unfortunately, by the scientific community, and he's branded as an outlier unworthy of the prize because of his behavior.",
        "But I think that's terrible unfair.",
        "The Nobel Prize should be given not for personality, but for true contributions.",
        "And that case was further aggravated by the fact that the Nobel Prize got awarded to three people, but they gave it to Lauterbur and justifiably to an English researcher, Sir Peter Mansfield, and left the third slot open, further enflaming Raymond Damadian as an example.",
        "That's interesting.",
        "And there are people - there are many times patents that come out of these discoveries.",
        "And one way that people fight back is to fight the patent, that they go to court for decades, say, I'm the rightful owner of this patent.",
        "Well, as an example, Damadian, of course, had an initial patent for an imaging machine very similar to the idea of MRI, but his concept was not to image, but rather to derive chemical information from a magnet that would surround the individual and radio waves - the same basic physical process."

        "And that patent was finally confirmed in a lawsuit against some of the major vendors over - with a lawsuit brought by Damadian for infringement of his intellectual property, and it was brought up, in fact, to the federal appellate court immediately below the Supreme Court level and once again confirmed.",
        "And that was the basis, by the way, of Damadian finally winning a total of perhaps $250 million from the major vendors who were propagating, selling MRI machines, and so forth.",
        "Of course, all you have sometimes, if it's very basic research, and I'm thinking now that the Higgs boson has been discovered, it's going to be a fight for - maybe not a fight, much of a fight for the Nobel Prize for the Higgs, because there's no product that's going to come out of discovery of the Higgs boson.",
