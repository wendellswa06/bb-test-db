        "What was the deal that apparently couldn't be reached?",
        "So earlier in the week, the White House and a group of lawmakers had agreed on what they believed should be the four pillars of a deal.",
        "And this group of six senators reached a compromise on those pillars, which included a path to citizenship for the so-called DREAMers, initial funds for both a border wall and more border security, changes to immigration policy involving your family and changes to what's known as the visa lottery system, which is a random system that lets about 50,000 people come into the country every year.",
        "The president rejected that agreement, was particularly angry about the visa lottery system and, in doing so, made - what I think is fair to say - very well-documented comments about certain African nations that sort of blew up the talks.",
        "What does the president want?",
        "Do we know?",
        "The headlines are going to be the president fails again.",
        "It's his bill, not our bill.",
        "That is the question.",
        "And it seems to be constantly changing.",
        "On Tuesday at the White House meeting, the president told lawmakers essentially, if you come up with a compromise, I'll sign what you send me.",

        "I think it's fair to say he wants a win.",
        "And on this issue, it's tough for him because he needs to be able to bring something back to his base on a key issue in his campaign but also come up with a deal that Democrats can vote for.",
        "It doesn't sound like a deal's in the offing.",
        "It does not sound like a deal is in the offing.",
        "But I always caveat that tough deals like this often only come together when there's a sort of a pressure cooker dynamic on Capitol Hill.",
        "I'm not quite sure we're there yet.",
        "People like to talk about how much they want to see bipartisanship on these tough issues.",
        "But the truth is that often bipartisanship means, by nature, that both parties will have to agree to something that their most core supporters are not happy with.",
        "And that's tough.",
        "There is a shutdown looming, which might concentrate the mind.",
        "That often has that effect (laughter) among lawmakers.",
        "A significant number of Democrats have been arguing that they should withhold their votes on keeping the government open, which is a Friday deadline, when they run out of money.",
        "They'll need at least a stopgap measure.",
        "And Democrats have made the case that they have leverage at this moment - that they should withhold their votes on government funding unless they can extract an agreement on immigration.",
        "House Speaker Paul Ryan, on Friday, said he does not believe there will be a government shutdown.",
        "But I also think it's fair to say that comments like the president made have made it even more complicated because there's a significant number of Democrats who look at a White House with a president who has an approval rating hovering in the 30s on an issue that highly motivates Democratic voters.",
        "And they're saying, why are we compromising with a president who not only seems to not know what he wants but is making comments that, for a lot of voters, are just seen as racial or outright racist?",
        "Does either party see political damage in permitting a shutdown?",
        "Nobody wants a shutdown.",
        "I do believe that's true, although I do think that on this issue - more than a lot of issues - that passions are really high because it's not just talking about fiscal policy or some other thing.",

        "And human lives are at stake, and families are at stake.",
        "So it's not going to be an easy puzzle to solve.",

        "And one of the fundamental questions that raises is whether there really are $20 bills lying on the sidewalk.",
        "She has academic research to back up that skepticism, but she also turns to her own life for an example.",
        "We had a company come to our house and make a bunch of recommendations to make our house more energy efficient.",
        "And one of them involved blowing insulation into our walls and drilling holes every three feet on our walls.",
        "Once Wolfram realized how much it would cost, not just for the insulation, but to patch and repaint all of her walls, she concluded that it wasn't worth it for the modest savings she'd see on her energy bills.",

        "Wolfram's also leery of the cost of switching to renewable sources of energy like wind and solar.",

        "People would have a powerful reason to install solar panels, store some of that energy in the batteries in their electric cars, and even send pulses of it back to the electric grid.",
        "There will be an opportunity to sell that power back to the utility, making money on the deal.",
        "And people will think of their cars and their homes as not devices that simply suck up money in the form of energy, but generate it and put it back in the system and make money.",
        "The grid would have to be reconfigured to handle all those scattered energy sources, but Kammen says if there's money to be made, innovation will surely follow.",
        "So, I don't think the 80 percent reduction goal by 2050, which sounds like radical surgery - it sounds like a new industrial revolution - is going to be that hard.",
