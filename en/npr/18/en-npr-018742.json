        "Is it true that you actually didn't retire as a detective but are working undercover?",

        "What do you learn by working with Hammett words about Hammett dialogue?",

        "You know, when Hammett was first attracted to Hollywood, he heard the first talkie and he knew that the talents that he had were in demand in Hollywood, and indeed they were.",
        "You know, Hollywood had gone from a formula by which action advanced a plot in the days of the silent movies to a formula in which dialogue and character advanced the plot.",
        "And the two things that Hammett did superbly was develop character and write dialogue.",
        "Were the screenplays, the stories that he wrote, darker than the movies that got made out of them?",
        "In some respects, they were darker.",
        "But the big difference that you see between the Hammett story and the produced movie has to do with the drinking and the sexuality, but especially the sexuality.",

        "Why did the studio eventually get tired of Dashiell Hammett?",
        "The studio got tired of him for two reasons, I think.",
        "First of all, because of his, quote, \"\"irregular habits.",
        "Irregular habits meant regular drinking.",
        "Regular drinking.",
        "He had a reputation for not showing up at the appointed time, often because he was drunk, sometimes because he had been out partying all night and just didn't feel like getting out of bed.",
        "But more important than that, Hammett was, at that time, becoming political active and he was involved in the Screenwriters Guild, a unionization effort of the screenwriters, to force the studios to give the writers credit and money for the work that they did.",
        "And he'd also been at least briefly a communist.",
        "No.",
        "It wasn't briefly - it was a long-term commitment.",
        "He was a member of the Communist Party, card-carrying.",
        "He apparently joined the party in about 1935, at about the time he was - just before the time he was writing after \"\"After the Thin Man.\"\" And he remained a member of the party, you know, for the next, what, two decades.",
        "How did he grow to feel about this franchise that he'd created?",
        "I think he was fed up with Nick and Nora Charles.",
        "Not fed up - he was tired of them pretty early on and he was fed up with the studios for the exploitation of the characters that he saw.",
        "Just before he finished the last draft for \"\"Another Thin Man,\"\" MGM bought all rights to the characters Nick and Nora Charles and Asta so that they could develop the series without him.",
        "They paid $40,000 for those character rights.",
        "And Hammett wrote to Lillian Hellman just after that: There may be better writers than I am, but nobody ever created a more insufferably smug set of characters than the Charleses, and they can't take that away from me, even for $40,000."

        "They're already trying to barter oil to some of their customers.",
        "They are trying to barter oil with some of their customers in some cases - India being a good example, nearly half of what the Indians buy, they pay with their own currency, which means Iran can only buy goods from within India.",
        "Many of its customers are not just bargaining hard, but they're basically saying we're not going to buy unless you discount dramatically.",

        "Suddenly, those conditions are no longer out there.",
        "They're coming back.",
        "And the only thing that's different is they're under more pressure.",
        "Should the United States and its allies - this is the P5 plus one as this formulation is known - the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany.",
        "Should they resume negotiations with Iran without those confidence-building measures, i.e. without the IAEA inspectors getting into some of those bases that Iran has denied access?",
        "Well, certainly, the Iranians allowing that access would create a different kind of climate for the talks, but I think, at this point, the position we have had all along - and not just the United States but the other members of the five plus one - has been Iran should demonstrate transparency, for sure.",
        "But we're not the ones who imposed conditions for talks.",
        "Now, we have said there's no point in having talks if they're not prepared to discuss their nuclear program.",

        "Now, they're dropping those conditions.",

        "This time around they're going to have to demonstrate that they're serious.",
        "If the talks are going to succeed, you're going to have to see that there's not only a serious engagement, but they're prepared to consider what would be really tangible steps that would bring them back into compliance with their international obligations and restore the confidence of the international community.",
        "And as you look at it, though, Iran is not a unitary political system.",
        "There's considerable division between President Ahmadinejad and the Supreme Leader Khamenei - Ali Khamenei.",

        "You know, we have seen what is probably the most severe struggle for power since the time of the Islamic revolution itself.",
        "There is no question they have severe problems, which I think, by the way, the isolation internationally, the shift in the balance of power in the region, and the sanctions which are unprecedented are exacerbating.",
        "They're not necessarily the cause of that, but it's not a surprise that that struggle for power is becoming more acute at a time when having resources is itself something that's becoming more acute.",
        "Having said all that, the supreme leader, I believe, is the decision-maker.",
        "I think he may well be influenced by others, but I do believe he's the decision-maker, and he's capable of making a decision.",
        "The challenge, I do think, is how he decides and what he decides is the greatest threat to Iran, and specifically the system of power that he presides over.",
        "He is someone who has built an edifice based on hostility towards us and conceding to us has always been, in his words, a problem because if - he argues and has said, as much for internal purposes as any other, I suspect, that once you begin to concede to what he calls the arrogant powers, nothing will satisfy them until the Islamic Republic itself is gone.",
        "So the fear that if he's conceding to us, he may threaten his hold on power is one element.",
        "Conversely, if he doesn't concede and the pressure continues to build, will that, in fact, create a threat to the system of power that he presides over?",
        "If he answers the question by focusing on the consequences of not making these concessions, then there's clearly going to be a diplomatic way out.",
        "And we'll get callers in on the conversation in a moment, but there is historical precedent to talk about as well, and that is Khamenei's successor, Ayatollah Khomeini, the guiding spirit of the Iranian revolution, near the end of the Iran-Iraq war, announced that he would swallow the bitter poison and accept less than his demands from Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and there was, finally, an end to the bloodshed.",
        "You know, when you go back and you look at that historically, it's a very interesting and I think constructive example.",
        "Khomeini had declared they would fight the Iraqis forever.",
        "He said 20 years longer, whatever it takes.",
        "And then, in 1988, the Revolutionary Guard and Mousavi, who was then the prime minister, came to him and said, we don't have the troops.",
        "We don't have the money.",
        "We can't continue to carry on this war.",
        "We have to bring it to an end.",
        "You're going to have to accept the ceasefire, which was a conclusion of that war.",
        "And he then, as he said, drank the poison from a chalice - it was the equivalent of drinking poison from a chalice - and he did it because the consequences of not doing so were so high, not withstanding everything he'd said before.",
        "Khamenei, who is the, you know, is the supreme leader today, made a decision in 2003 to suspend enrichment, and he did it at that time in the aftermath of our defeating in three weeks the Iraqi army, an army that they couldn't defeat in eight and half years and basically had to sue(ph) for peace with when they feared that they might be next.",
        "So when there's a context created that they view as being sufficiently costly, and you give them a way out - I mean, it can't just be, you put them in the corner and leave no way out, but you give them a way out, and they feel they have to find that way out, then there is hope for a diplomatic outcome.",
        "Whether it succeeds or not, I think, depends on the question I was posing before - how does the supreme leader define what is the greatest threat from his standpoint?",
        "Does he see conceding less as the greatest threat, or does he see the consequence of the pressure continuing to build being the greatest threat?",
        "This is Dennis Ross, Ambassador Dennis Ross, a counselor at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, just left the Obama administration, where he was a special assistant for the Middle East, Afghanistan and South Asia.",
        "Where do we draw the line with Iran?",
        "Let's start with Bill.",
        "Bill with us from Iowa City.",
        "You know, one of the things we really have to do is to convince both Iran and Israel that we mean it, that we will lead the attack if they actually get the nuclear weapon.",
        "And one way to do that would be to sign a mutual attack pact with Israel, not just nuclear technology, but them actually getting the bomb.",
        "If we did that, they would never get the bomb and Israel would wait.",
        "So in other words, reassure Israel - I'm just trying to clarify what you're saying, Bill, reassure Israel that should Iran actually acquire nuclear weapons, not simply the capability of making nuclear weapons, but actual nuclear weapons, we would lead the attack?"
