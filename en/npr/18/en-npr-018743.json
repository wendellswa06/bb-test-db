        "Yes.",
        "And every power has always tested a weapon before it does them any good, and also if Iran knows that they wouldn't get one.",
        "They're not suicidal.",
        "They are rational(ph) .",
        "And, well, Ambassador Ross?",
        "Early in 1944, Southern England bristled with 150,000 American, British and Canadian soldiers gathering for the invasion the Allies hoped would end World War II.",
        "Now, the soldiers, pilots, and sailors knew they were there to be launched into Nazi-occupied Europe.",
        "Hard to hide the largest invasion force in history.",
        "After all, LIFE magazine even ran photos of GIs in Piccadilly and the Germans surely knew they were coming.",
        "But where?",
        "Gromosiak also wrote a book about death-defying stunts at Niagara.",
        "Large crowds have always flocked to daredevils trying to conquer the Falls.",
        "He says the city was most alive during these times.",
        "That changed when Gromosiak was 9 years old.",
        "I think - look, this is a complicated question, to say the least.",
        "The issue, I think, with the Israelis is several-fold.",
        "Number one, they view Iran with this kind of a capability, including - even if they haven't finally turned the last screw and tested a weapon, but they have everything but that, they see it creating - casting a shadow over the region, making Iran far bolder in terms of their activity and their threats and their actions and increasing the probability that Hezbollah, as an example, would become far more aggressive against the Israelis.",
        "So they worry about that.",
        "But I think that they also worry about the fact that if Iran gets the weapon at some point, they might well use it.",
        "And I think, from an Israel standpoint, to face an existential threat and give up the military option of dealing with it is a big decision.",
        "Now, having said that, the Israelis, by the same token, have also made it clear throughout, they have always viewed this as being not a case of Israel against Iran, but the world against Iran, to the extent to which it becomes clear from an Israeli standpoint that they know that the world, in this case led by the United States, is going to ensure that Iran doesn't cross this particular threshold - then it clearly will affect the Israeli calculus.",
        "One fear the Israelis have is that diplomacy could drag on so long and put Iran in a position where they reach the point where they have such a depth and breadth of a nuclear program and its infrastructure that even if Israel were to act militarily, it would have almost no effect, and therefore they would be facing an existential threat, not know for sure that the rest of the world would deal with it, and would have given up their military options.",
        "So from their standpoint, they want to be certain that if a diplomacy is going to be applied, there's some kind of time frame within this that Israel doesn't lose what could be the option.",
        "The question of exactly kinds of assurances we give the Israelis, you had the prime minister here meeting with the president.",
        "What you found were a great deal of convergence on the issue of objective, meaning prevention, not containment, preventing Iran from having such a capability and not simply living with it and containing it.",
        "You also had convergence on the issue of the means, the preferred means, meaning the best way to resolve this issue is through diplomatic means.",
        "There is still a question of timelines because the Israelis fear that they lose their military option well before the United States would do so.",
        "And the problem here is that no Israeli leader is going to want to tie his hands and reduce his freedom of action when facing such a potential threat.",
        "He wasn't going to come here and ask the president for certain kinds of assurances that were so explicit because the president would in turn ask him for similar kinds of assurances.",
        "And I think at this stage, in effect, neither leader really wants to be in a position where their hands are tied when it comes to deciding exactly what you're going to do and at what point you're going to do it.",
        "That said, I think there is time for diplomacy, number one.",
        "Number two, when the president says, you know, the time will run out, it's another way of signaling both the Iranians, don't come into negotiations and simply play for time or simply think that this is some kind of game and we're not deadly serious about the commitment to preventing; but it was also a message to the Israelis, saying, look, I'm not going to go into this in a way that creates a trap and is open-ended.",
        "The diplomacy will be serious.",
        "It'll be real.",
        "We need the time and space to pursue it.",
        "And you have the assurance from us that we're not simply going to be fooled."

        "There's another question that has also been raised, and that is Israel has hundreds of nuclear weapons of its own.",
        "Why would deterrence not work?",
        "Why would Iran use its small stockpile of nuclear weapons when it knows it would face complete destruction in return?",
        "Israelis, of course, have never admitted that they have such a capability.",
        "You and I know they do.",
        "There certainly is enormous suspicion that they might have such a capability.",
        "Let's presume for a moment to say that you could recreate the circumstances of the Cold War, where Israel has this capability, Iran has the capability.",
        "Why doesn't the logic of the Cold War and the balance of terror apply?",
        "I would say several factors are at a play here.",
        "One is that you're talking about a very small country with a very concentrated population looking at a regime that has a messianic kind of ideology, that has said that Israel is a tumor, a cancer to be wiped out in the area, and have talked about wiping it off the map, parading weapon systems.",
        "Their weapon systems, when they parade their missiles, actually have these slogans that this is targeted for the - what they call the Zionist entity.",
        "So if you're Israel and you're looking at that, are you going to say we can have high confidence that the balance of terror will hold?",
        "That's the first question.",
        "The second is, the - during the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union had all sorts of channels of communication.",
        "Iran and Israel do not have channels of communication.",
        "Given the vulnerability that the Israelis are likely to feel, and I would say the vulnerability potentials that the Iranians would feel as well, each country would be on a hair-trigger.",
        "They could not - they would each feel they couldn't afford to strike second.",
        "The problem with being on a hair-trigger in area where there's lots of local triggers for a conflict is that you can quickly set in motion a train of events that may not be so easy to control.",
        "I've described it once as a kind of Guns of August on steroids.",
        "And if you look at a particular scenario that is not that far-fetched, that you could see Israel and Hezbollah getting into a conflict much like what existed in 2006, as soon as it takes place in an atmosphere where the Assad regime is gone and suddenly Iran looks at Hezbollah - and Hezbollah is the only place they have successfully exported the Islamic Republic - and to see - I mean, the Islamic revolution - and to see what - see Hezbollah potentially threatened under those circumstances, even if Hezbollah is the one that's triggering the conflict, you could see the Iranians saying, you know, we're going to raise the level of – the level, the readiness level of our forces.",
        "They're going to - we'll threaten the Israelis because this is something we can't tolerate.",
        "The Israelis see this and do they wait and say, gee, we can't afford to wait and see if we're wrong about whether this is going to lead someplace?",
        "The kind of uncertainties that are triggered are such that you could easily envision a scenario that produces a nuclear war even if it's not intended.",
        "Those who say that, you know, that Iran, once they got this would necessarily use the weapons, I don't assume that, but you can set in motion a train of events that couldn't be controlled.",
        "The British effort to feign, trick and fool the Germans into believing the D-Day invasion would be anywhere but Normandy was one of the great military victories in history.",
        "And it was largely the work of people plotting at desks: untrustworthy double-agents, West End set designers and at least one pigeon handler.",
        "Ben MacIntyre tells their story in his new book, \"\"Double Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies.\"\" Ben MacIntyre, author of the previous best-sellers, including \"\"Operation Mincemeat\"\" and \"\"Agent Zigzag,\"\" joins us from Tarbert, Scotland.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "And the idea being very simply that if Hitler could be convinced that the attack on Normandy was simply a feint, a sort of diversionary attack before the main attack, then that would make a huge difference.",
        "It would mean that the Normandy beachhead could be established.",
        "So it was a sort of a poker game they were playing, which was really a game of massive bluff.",
        "In these days when people tweet about what they had for breakfast, how do you keep an operation of this magnitude secret when it's so close by?",
        "Well, I mean, that was in a way - the great triumph here, was that with unbelievable security they just managed to tie it up.",
        "One of the great advantages they had was that they - because they had access to all the decrypted German intelligence signals, they could tell whether the deception was working.",
        "They could, in real time, follow what the Germans were thinking about what the Allied intentions were.",
        "And so they had a way of backing it up, which absolutely reinforced the deception.",

        "So Patton was in nominal command of an army that didn't exist.",
        "And so therefore went around boasting, hey guys, we're going to hit Calais very soon.",
        "And he himself said, I'm a natural goddamn ham, in the hope that he would be overheard and this information would be relayed back to Germany.",
