        "People like Charlie Rangel, who does have progressive views himself, but who's also an inside player and who knows the nuts and bolts of dealing on both sides of the aisle and in the business community and everywhere else.",
        "They're going to have a rough row to hoe trying to frame a message that will get the support of all these parts of the caucus.",
        "And then the other thing I wanted to say is that the - Pelosi finds herself in another no-win situation, like the Murtha thing.",
        "If she goes with Alcee Hastings, it's going to be all the stuff about corruption, and do you really believe in ethical change and look what happened before.",
        "And if she doesn't go with them, the black caucus is going to be upset.",
        "So she's somewhere now painfully trying to figure out after having been, as somebody put it, spanked.",
        "You know, what does she do next about this other thing?",
        "So the Democrats, as usual, are all off in all different directions.",
        "And I think the media, too - story now is look at the conflict within the Democratic Party.",
        "Somebody has got to manage that somehow, too.",
        "So basically, we're not out of the woods yet, and we're not even - actually, we're just entering the woods.",
        "And it will be interesting to see how it goes.",
        "All right.",
        "Blame the media, we don't - we don't create the conflict.",
        "We just publicize it.",
        "We just publicize it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We love it.",
        "Right, Farai.",
        "That's our business.",
        "But, Joe, I mean, you know, you're at The Washington Post, there's got to be time, you know, you guys got to be like tap dancing around the offices, you got a lot to report on.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "And I think the Democrats are giving a lot of fodder to reporters now.",
        "I mean I think it's almost incredible that they've gotten off on this, you know, this step right after such an enormous victory.",
        "They're here a week later.",
        "This - the publicity is so much in the other direction about the vision, about the leader of the Democrats in the House getting spanked, as Mary said.",
        "I think that - I think for the Democrats it really puts them off on the wrong foot, and they really need to regroup between now and when the new Congress starts in January."

        "All right.",
        "Well, I want to move along to a couple of other topics, some tough language, the n-word and the word coon.",
        "Now the term coon has historically been offensive but Howard University students are kind of using it as this more gentle put-down, perhaps.",
        "Everyday conversation, they're saying things like that person's coonin' and if you're doing the chicken noodle soup dance.",
        "Now, I didn't even know about the chicken noodle soup dance until recently.",
        "I'm 37 and, you know…",
        "Wow.",
        "I guess that's beyond me so whatever.",
        "But anyway, we spoke to the editor of Howard's newspaper, The Hilltop, Ayesha Rascoe.",
        "And she said a lot of students think that it's a good way to, you know, kind of use something like the n-word that's not the n-word.",
        "They may not know the history of the word.",
        "I think that's probably part of the problem, that they don't know the history of the word and they just leave it at that.",
        "You know, the way there are different characters or different stereotypes about black people, you have the mammy, you have a coon.",
        "I think they're using it in that they believe they're using it in that sense.",
        "That this is just another stereotype.",
        "Okay, Prof. Berry, can you use coon or coonin' in a way that it's not as offensive as the n-word?",
        "Let's start with Congressman Charles Rangel.",
        "The congressman from Harlem is making news this week because he has come out and said very clearly that if the Democrats gain control of the Congress that his Ways and Means Committee will look at undoing some of the tax cuts that were put in place by President Bush.",
        "Yeah, commercial grower.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No.",
        "I think that they're both actually offensive and they both reflect the ignorance, lack of knowledge, lack of sensitivity about being serious about issues.",
        "Part of it reflects being young and being a student and playing around with stuff and not knowing what you're playing around with.",
        "But - and there are people still alive, including some of those who didn't vote for Harold Ford after that ad that came on the air who still think - down in my home state of Tennessee - of us as coons, the old negros who are worthless, for nothing and, you know, sexually challenged and everything else.",
        "So I think that given the seriousness of the problems that we face as a people - five more states getting ready to vote on the affirmative action referendum, they're gearing up to do that after the Michigan thing, and other issues that go on - that somebody needs to educate the students better about what they are doing.",
        "If they still choose to do it, then, you know, they would say that they're having fun.",
        "I talked to some about it and they said, well - because Howard is my alma mater - and they said we're just having fun, you know.",
        "If people don't want to stop us from having fun, you know, that's old school.",
        "And that we can make words mean whatever we think the word should mean and we're just playing.",
        "So pretty soon they may be calling each other the - females maybe calling each other mammy, for as far as I know."

        "Well, Glenn, I mean, you know, there is a long history of black folks having inside jokes and then getting offended when white folks pick up those jokes.",
        "And so how can we have a situation where, you know, there is an inside culture and then there's an outside culture?",
        "Can you have something like coonin' mean one thing in the black community and then say oh, it's not going to spill over.",
        "Because this all came about because there was an AP article, so it's getting out.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean of course you can have the same word having different meanings inside and out.",
        "It's not going to be a surprise if people are, you know, in a stigmatized, stereotyped kind of position within a society that they might take those very instruments of their own stigmatization and then turn them into some kind of playful and ironical critique back at the society itself.",
        "I'm not trying to impute any high-level intellectuality to these Howard students that we're talking about.",
        "But I'm just saying the fact that black people will make use of the same sort of cultural apparatus which is also an instrument of their oppression or stigmatization isn't paradoxical and it isn't a surprise.",
        "But I do want to say one thing, there are real coon-making, if you will allow me, institutions in our society right now.",
        "I'm talking about prisons that are very black, or about media and entertainment dynamic that projects images about black people in a particular way, or about ghettos in the hearts of our great cities and so forth.",
        "These are real, today, coon-making institutions.",
        "We don't have minstrel shows anymore.",
        "There aren't any Sambos and Mammys running around anymore, but there are racially stigmatizing institutions that are very powerful.",
        "And rather than critiquing the words of Howard students, I would, you know, rather that we were critiquing the institutions of American society that are making the modern 21st century coons.",
        "Whoa.",
        "You know, if I might pick up on that.",
        "Some of those -",
        "Joe, we have 30 seconds.",
        "Okay.",
        "One difference between the institutions of yesterday and the institutions of today I think is that many of the institutions of today are created or controlled at least by black people, even if they aren't owned by black people.",
        "And I'm talking about the hip-hop videos.",
        "I'm talking about the kinds of programming you see on BET, for example.",
        "This is black people doing this to black people, and often being purchased by white people.",
        "As opposed to years ago, when it was really those institutions were more or less imposed on the black community from without.",
        "Denigrating yourself, that's very deep."
