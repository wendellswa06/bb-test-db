        "They gravitationally interact, and we get these sort of eccentric, elongated orbits and also these sort of closed-in, or what are often called hot Jupiters, which, interestingly, are exacting the sort of thing we see in many cases amongst the exoplanets that have been discovered.",
        "But you say that's not what you think happened to our solar system.",
        "Well, what we think happened in our solar system is that we are an example of a system that was sort of near the boundary between something that actually formed gas giants, formed, well, the Jupiter and Saturn that we see today, and something that if conditions had been a little bit different wouldn't have really formed any gas giants at all.",
        "It would have just contained a bunch of smaller rocky terrestrial bodies, maybe a couple of Neptune mass things.",
        "And because of that, the planets, the gas giants which did form, had a relatively peaceful birthing process and their orbits essentially stayed relatively close to where they were originally born.",

        "It seems like you need a fairly narrow range of conditions.",

        "They don't form too late.",
