        "If one of them or both of them die or one of them gets or both of them get ill, most of these boomers don't have their stuff taken care of.",
        "And I have a number of friends and myself, you know, my father is getting ill, my friend just had to spend two or three weeks out in Virginia after his mother passed, because it is really hard to go clean up after someone.",

        "He said Costco's CEO is onto something paying entry-level employees $11.50 an hour and long time workers even more.",
        "He's sees that if he's doing right by Costco's workers, then they can buy that 80 inch TV, too.",
        "In his State of the Union address last night, President Obama announced he would sign an executive order setting a minimum wage for future federal contract workers at $10.10 an hour.",
        "It's still not clear how many people that would help or how quickly, but he took that step because his calls for Congress to raise the federal minimum wage have gone nowhere.",

        "And as I said last night to every governor, mayor, state legislator out there, if you want to take the initiative to raise your minimum wage laws to help more hardworking Americans make ends meet, then I'm going to be right there at your side.",
        "While Congress decides whether it's going to raise the minimum wage or not, people outside of Washington are not waiting for Congress and I'm not either.",
        "For progressive Democrats like Arizona Congressman Raul Grijalva, the fact that the president is talking about raising the minimum wage, even just for new federal contracts, is a victory on its own."

        "And it may encode some information about the past of a super massive black hole.",

        "Yeah, it's essentially an echo.",
        "It's what we call a light echo, an effect that we've seen around supernovas - stars that explode - and because of the vast scales involved, the speed of light is actually very slow.",
        "And so, you can actually, like, in an echo in sound, you can see the light moving outwards.",
        "And so, what we believe in this case happened is there used to be an extremely luminous quasar right next to this gas cloud.",
        "But this quasar has now disappeared.",
        "It shut down.",
        "But this gas cloud, because it is so far away, about 40,000 light years is still seeing the quasar, though we are not.",

        "Yeah, as discoveries usually are named after their discoverer, it has been named after Hanny van Arkel, but instead of calling it Hanny's Object, it quickly became known in our online community as Hanny's Voorwerp - voorwerp simply being the Dutch word for object but it sounds cooler.",
