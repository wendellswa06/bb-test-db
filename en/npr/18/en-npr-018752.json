        "Because with something that has been sort of bandied about is the theory that we've had a close encounter with another sun, with another star in our past, and there are actually some traces in the outer ranges, in the outer reaches of our planetary system, in the so-called Kyper Belt, that there may have been some gravitational disturbance in the past, which may have flung things around, and one of the theories is that we may just have had a sort of, you know, two-ships-passing-in-the-night kind of thing with another star.",

        "Interesting.",
        "OK.",
        "All right?",
        "OK.",

        "Sure.",
        "I think there's another possibility for that I might refer to.",
        "It might be the fact that he meant that our Sun is a second generation star.",
        "Our sun is enriched with heavy elements, with metals, and oxygen, and so forth, that have to have been made inside another star that died before our sun and our solar system formed.",
        "Ah.",
        "And so our sun is at least a second generation, if not the third generation star.",
        "Ah, yes.",
        "That might be what he meant indeed."

        "The sequence would be what, Kevin?",
        "It starts with H.",
        "So, in the very early universe, most of the elements that were made in the Big Bang were hydrogen and helium, and very few trace elements of heavier elements, like oxygen and iron and so forth.",
        "And these heavy elements are very important for making stars, because they allow the hydrogen and the helium to clump together, and collapse into stars then, and start to shine.",
        "And so the first generation of stars was probably very massive and short-lived...",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "Though this very much - a lot of work going on in that topic at the moment - that then seeded the material around it, as these stars exploded in supernovae, allowing the second generation of stars with a little bit more heavy elements to form, and then probably, you know, our solar system and our sun was made - was probably - has gone through the cycle probably at least a couple of times, before this particular cloud collapse that gave us our sun and our solar system around it.",
        "Where do we still see remnants of those originals, any around?",
        "They probably would have disappeared a long time ago.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And this fact that we are a later generation is probably also good news for our existence here, because what observers have been finding is that it is the more metal-rich stars that are seem to be more likely to have planets orbiting them.",
        "So, there seems to be - it seems to be the case that a higher content of heavy elements actually helps you form planets",
        "I - in the few moments we have left, Dr. Thommes, what would be the chance of finding a solar system just like ours, if it's so special?"

        "So, we think there are more of them out there.",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "We had have ordered a few percent of systems that where the giant planets at least resemble the architecture in our own system, as to whether we would then have terrestrial planets in the habitable zone, the chances of that actually aren't too bad, because the terrestrial planets, we think, they kind of sprout like mushrooms pretty much anywhere.",
