        "After care is another issue for people who are discharged from hospitals.",
        "It still is an issue.",
        "Just like there are not enough places for people to live in general, there aren't enough facilities like nursing homes, for example, for folks to go to, or rehabilitation facilities, group homes, those sorts of places.",
        "So the backlog continues where people have difficulty getting discharged from hospitals.",
        "But I'll tell you, that really has improved in the past few months.",
        "One of the things that most impressed me when we met in New Orleans late last spring was that, despite all the problems, your belief and hope and resilience of not only the health care system but the people of New Orleans to develop and find new solutions.",
        "Oh, I think that's one of the best qualities of the people in New Orleans.",
        "We are nothing if not resourceful and innovative.",
        "And it has been a pleasure working with so many groups on the ground trying to get this thing going.",
        "I mean even if the governments can't completely agree on the best thing to do with buildings and what-not, we have not stopped.",
        "And we've recognized that there are public health needs.",
        "There's medical needs.",
        "And we have found very creative ways to make it happen in partnership with the patients as well.",
        "But dealing with those big bureaucracies must be frustrating some of the time.",
        "Well, sometimes.",
        "I mean it can be immensely helpful.",
        "We have received some financial support from, you know, the federal, state and city governments.",
        "But it has not really been as generous as probably some of the private support that we have received, which I think was surprising to me going into this storm.",
        "But, all things considered, it's been a sort of a benefit because that private money, the foundation money, has given us the flexibility to be creative in developing these new medical homes, if you will, these neighborhood clinics.",
        "Instead of being stuck in the paradigm of the old traditional healthcare that was, you know, all paved for specific things in a specific way with a large set of rules, which is unfortunately how health care is.",
        "We've been able to be more creative, do home visits, for example.",
        "Use mobile units to deliver care, do group visits, really try to experiment in ways, in a positive way, to make health care much more patient centered.",
