        "When Rayid Ghani finished his work as the chief data scientist for President Obama's reelection campaign in 2012, he could have pretty much taken his pick of jobs in the tech world.",
        "Instead he went to the University of Chicago's School of Public Policy.",
        "There he's using data analytics to predict human behavior in relatively new ways.",
        "I asked him to describe one of his projects - working with police departments to predict which of the officers is likely to commit misconduct.",
        "Over the past 12 months, we have worked with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.",
        "We're right now working with Nashville, Knoxville, LA Sheriff's Department.",
        "And the idea is to take the data from these police departments and help them predict which officers are at risk of these adverse incidents.",
        "So instead of the systems today where you wait until somebody - something bad happens and, again, the only intervention at that point you have is punitive, we're focusing on, can I detect these things early?",
        "And if I can detect them early, can I direct interventions to them - so training, counseling.",
        "For example, one of the things we're finding - a few predictors we're finding are that stress is a big indicator there.",
        "For example, if you are an officer and you have been subject to - you know, you've been responding to a lot of domestic abuse cases or suicide cases, that is a big predictor of you being involved in an at-risk incident in the near future.",
        "But I could imagine if I'm a police officer and I've had a really stressful few weeks somebody coming to me and saying, because you have the potential for an adverse interaction coming up, we're going to put you at a desk for the next week, I might bristle at that and say, I haven't done anything wrong.",
        "And in fact, I'm doing really well in my job right now.",
        "Put me in, Coach.",
        "Absolutely, and I think that's where you don't want these algorithms to be black-box algorithms.",
        "You don't want it to just raise a flag and say, this officer is at risk.",
        "You want it to be able to work with the police department and explain to them, this officer is at risk because of these six reasons.",
        "And this officer has had pretty much the same behavior as these other 50 officers.",
        "Thirty-five of them ended up having an adverse incident.",
        "So you can now have an informed conversation.",
        "You can - you still - you might say, oh, yeah, well, that's fine, but this officer is different because of these reasons.",
        "So the part that we're getting much better at on the tech side is prediction.",
        "What we're not really good at right now is influencing behavior when it's - because what we want to do - be able to do is change behavior.",
        "We just - we don't want to just predict and then watch those things happen in the future.",
        "And so what we're working on right now is combining the two things as, how can you use the prediction techniques that we been developing for a really long time, combine that with the social science behavior-change techniques that people have developed around, you know, voting behavior and shopping behavior, and put the two together so you can start focusing on, how do we change these types of behaviors?",
        "How do we best interact with people and make an impact - because without putting the two together, there is very little impact.",
        "There also seems to be real potential for misuse there.",
        "I mean I'm thinking of the science fiction movie \"\"Minority Report\"\" in which people are punished for things they have not yet done.",

        "I do.",
        "None of these early abortion bans are in effect yet.",
