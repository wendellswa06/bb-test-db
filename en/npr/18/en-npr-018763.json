        "Well, Planned Parenthood President Dr. Leana Wen said in a statement that the governor's remarks are, quote, \"\"not based on medicine, facts or reality.\"\" Wen said Planned Parenthood does everything they can to ensure patient safety and meet the highest standard of care.",
        "And she said the state is weaponizing the inspections process, as she put it, and that this is really about trying to end abortion in Missouri.",
        "So a real stalemate here.",
        "Any sign of progress on this?",
        "Very good.",
        "Well, the first example that we have of that phrase is in the title of the John le Carre novel, \"\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.\"\" And after the publication of that novel, the word has come to be used in a wide variety of context to refer to someone coming in from some sort of metaphorical isolation.",
        "However, the implication in le Carre's book is that perhaps it was used in spy craft.",
        "We don't have any evidence of that, though, so we're hoping that someone will be able to come forward with documentation of how the word may have been used in the cloak-and-dagger world of espionage before le Carre published this book in 1963.",
        "That's so interesting because I always thought that he was using a commonly used phrase in the title of his book.",
        "But he may have actually made it up?",
        "We don't know.",
        "He has deep roots in the British espionage community, as is well documented, so it could very well be a piece of the language of espionage.",
        "But that's a jargon that's not often written down.",
        "And that sort of thing is the challenge that we face as historical lexicographers.",
        "Some of the best stories are hidden in places where they're not easily found.",
        "It's not always the case, but you can go through The New York Times archives and there, boom, it's the first example of the word.",
        "In fact, that's hardly ever the case.",
        "Can you ask him?",

        "So we'll ask him, send him an email and see if he can come forward with some kind of documentary evidence that we can use.",

        "That's the real challenge.",
        "In previous appeals that we've done in other contexts not online, we've had things like pieces of police jargon, which we managed to track back earlier through things like a policeman's notebook where it was clear.",
        "The date was authentic.",
        "We were able to authenticate the notebook, and we saw that indeed this word did go back earlier than we were able to track in other sources available to us.",
        "But it's all about documentary evidence.",
        "And regardless of what the story is that people say, unless we can see something connected on something that we can verify the data of, we can't give it as a genuine example in the Oxford English Dictionary.",

        "How can people help you?",
        "What is it that you want them to do?",
        "Well, we will - editors, as they go through revising the dictionary, we're currently doing an unprecedented revision of the entirety of the OED, which - if you've ever seen it, it's 20 volumes in print (unintelligible).",
        "I have seen it.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it's getting bigger.",

        "So this is a vast project.",
        "We're - some of these entries haven't been touched since 1884, when they were first published.",
        "That would be the things in A.",
        "And so we're looking at everything, re-examining it from the ground up.",
        "And, of course, we have many more resources available to us now than they did back in the 19th and early 20th centuries.",
        "The Internet is an incredible resource for us.",
        "So we're finding a lot of earlier evidence of the entries we already have.",
        "But sometimes, as editors are going through a word, they just feel that there must be something better out there than they're able to see in the resources at hand.",
        "That would be our own files, online databases and corpora.",
        "And so when that happens, they can nominate a word to be included in the OED Appeals.",
        "And then - and that means we'll post it on the Appeals website, which is oed.com/appeals, and explain what the situation is, why we think that there may be earlier evidence out there.",
        "And then we leave it open in the comments for people to come forward and provide earlier evidence that they may be able to find."

        "But the - someone remembered hearing a Monty Python record that used this term back in - I think it was 1972, and that is datable.",
        "So we were able to use that, verify the date, listen to it, get a transcript and put it in the OED archive.",
