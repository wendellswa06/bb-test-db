        "They've also disagreed about a demand from the state to interview seven doctors who perform abortions there.",
        "The state has interviewed two more senior physicians, but Planned Parenthood has declined to subject some trainees to questioning.",
        "Here's what Governor Parson says about it.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)",
        "If Planned Parenthood is following all Missouri laws governing abortion and operating a safe environment for women's care, they shouldn't have any issues cooperating with the standard and ordinary review required by state law.",
        "And Parson says state inspectors have found numerous deficiencies.",
        "He talked about a couple of incidences of what he described as failed abortions, but when pressed for more details by reporters in the room, he said he couldn't go into a lot of specifics because of an ongoing investigation.",
        "Parson did say that if Planned Parenthood can comply by the deadline, they would have a right to renew their license.",
        "There are really two films that really struck me.",
        "They're documentaries about major show-business figures who had complicated, troubled lives, and you get to see inside these lives in a really unexpected way.",

        "She had a major involvement in the civil rights movement.",
        "Then she had a lot of personal difficulties.",
        "And this film really shows us what her life was like in a very intimate way.",
        "The other film is about Marlon Brando.",
        "It's called \"\"Listen To Me Marlon\"\" because this is from a collection of audio tapes that Brando made for his own use.",
        "He was going to do some kind of project with these tapes, then he died and filmmakers have gotten access to them.",
        "They've also gotten access to TV interviews, newsreels that Brando did.",
        "And this is kind of a sound-and-image collage that really gives you a real idea of the kind of person he was.",
        "If you care about Marlon Brando and if you care about film acting - of course you do - this film is really a revelation.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Our image is of a progressive destruction of Jews inside Germany.",
        "But in fact, Germany, like most states that weren't destroyed, was a relatively safer place for Jews than the places where German power actually destroyed other regimes.",
        "Once we see this basic contrast that Jews in stateless zones had about a 1-in-20 chance of surviving whereas Jews in states had about a 1-in-2 chance of surviving, we have to ask the question about the causes of the Holocaust a little differently.",

        "In 1940, it doesn't destroy the French elite.",
        "It doesn't destroy French institutions.",
        "And so then, by 1941, when the final solution begins, different things are simply possible in Poland than they are in France.",
        "In anticipating the elimination of Poland from the map and from the memory of the Poles, Hitler, you write, had in mind, at least in part, the example of the way things had been in the American West."
