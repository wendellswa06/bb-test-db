        "So Hitler saw the Earth in these very simple zoological terms.",
        "He thought that races were different the way that species were different and that the only real moral value that could exist was loyalty to one's own race.",
        "So his attitudes towards Jews, although, of course, anti-Semitic, went beyond conventional anti-Semitism.",
        "His idea was that Jews were not a race.",
        "Jews were not really humans at all.",
        "What Jews did was introduce ideas of reciprocity, whether that be law, whether that be socialism, whether that be capitalism, whether that be the state, whether that be Christianity.",
        "Any idea that allows a person to recognize another person as human, Hitler argued, was Jewish.",
        "Therefore, Jews had to be removed from the planet so that the natural racial struggle could begin.",
        "So Hitler's plan basically had two levels.",
        "The first level was the Jews have to be removed so that the strong race, the Germans, can triumph.",
        "And the second level was the Germans should invade Eastern Europe, and that is the geographical place where this triumph will actually take place.",
        "The way those two ideas come together is precisely this notion that Jews and Bolshevisk, Jews and communists, are the same people.",
        "If Jews are communists and communists are Jews, then an invasion of Eastern Europe can mean the destruction of Jews just as it means the destruction of the Soviet Union and therefore the opening of all of Eastern Europe to this new German program of colonization.",
        "The kind of statelessness that you write about - what prevailed in Poland and the Baltic republics and the western Soviet Union in the early 1940s - if we look around for something like that today, I think of Syria.",
        "I think of eastern Ukraine.",
        "Yeah, and unfortunately, I do, too.",
        "And the way that I see the world today is driven by the way I think about the 1930s.",
        "Our classical way of thinking about the 1930s is that a totalitarian state got stronger and stronger and oppressed its own citizens more and more.",
        "That picture is very misleading.",
        "What actually happened is that a German state which was powerful to start out with was taken over by a very special kind of racial institution, the Nazi Party, and then set out to spread anarchy in Eastern Europe.",
        "And it was in that zone of anarchy that a Holocaust was possible.",
        "And precisely, when one looks at the Middle East, one sees what happens when a state was destroyed.",
        "The Iraqi state in 2003 was, of course, a terrible regime.",
        "But one has to think carefully about destroying a regime because when one destroys a regime, one is opening up the possibility for all kinds of other things to happen.",
        "Ukraine, in a way, is even more frightening because in Ukraine, you have a case where the Russian leadership quite consciously evokes the 1930s in a positive light.",
        "President Putin has rehabilitated the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which was the agreement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union which led to the destruction of Poland, the destruction of the Baltic states.",
        "He's rehabilitated the beginning of the Second World War as he talks about how Ukraine doesn't really exist, as he wages war against Ukraine.",
        "So it's very hard not, for me, at least, not to make that historical connection.",
        "The subtitle of your book, \"\"Black Earth,\"\" is \"\"The Holocaust As History And Warning.\"\" What's the warning?",
        "My basic view is that since we have understood the Holocaust backwards, that we focus basically on the wrong things, that misunderstanding creates dangers.",
        "We haven't learned the two lessons that we need to learn.",
        "The first of them, which we've talked about, is about state destruction.",
        "We don't recognize that preserving state institutions is necessary to preserve human lives, which means that we should be focusing on strengthening institutions that strengthen states around the world.",
        "The second lesson that we haven't learned has to do with science.",
        "When Hitler was coming to power in the 1930s, what he claimed was that Germany was facing some kind of ecological crisis in which the only solution was to conquer its neighbors.",
        "In fact, the ecological crisis he was talking about, the shortage of food, was going to be solved by technology.",
        "So he's faced with a choice between science and ideology, and he chooses ideology, the ideology of conquest.",
        "One of the lessons of the Holocaust is that when you face choices between ideology and science, you should first see if science offers you solutions, and I mean this particularly in a time of climate change in which real shortages of food and real shortages of water are just around the corner."

        "The challenge when you're cruising on two wheels is the wind whipping about your head.",
        "This is what 35 miles per hour sounds like on a quiet scooter.",
        "The wind begins to drown out other sounds.",
        "Some riders use earplugs to help lessen the noise, but that leads to another risk, like a fine.",
        "Last year, Ralph Buss lost an appeal defending a motorcyclist who was ticketed for wearing ear plugs.",
        "It is illegal to use earplugs in both ears while operating a vehicle unless you're an emergency or road worker.",
        "Eric Healy is a hearing science professor at the Ohio State University who testified in the earplug challenge.",
        "What's clear is that wind noise on a motorcycle can be very, very intense, intense enough to damage your hearing.",
        "And what's also crystal clear is that earplugs can remedy that, you know, almost completely."

        "So we've partnered with the Children's Defense Fund Freedom Schools.",
        "And the freedom schools is an active school enrichment program that really connects students and parents with the resources in their community, helps generate more positive attitudes towards learning, and pair students, especially disadvantaged students up with mentors because, you know, there's some several pieces of research that confirm that mentoring can really boost up a child's leadership skills and just actually just make them want to learn more and make it fun.",
