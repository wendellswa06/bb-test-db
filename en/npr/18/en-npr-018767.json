        "Usually, you look for a change in previous - from previous behavior.",
        "So being more forgetful, maybe getting confused, exaggerations of missteps that maybe we make in ordinary life just happening more often, like forgetting keys more often, maybe having a little trouble calculating a checkbook, making change, these kinds of things are very early signs.",
        "And how do you know what is abnormal?",
        "I mean, we all forget our keys now and then.",
        "We do.",

        "In Ohio, for instance, you can't wear earplugs, but South Dakota, on the other hand, has no earplug law on the books.",

        "The reason that this is important is that in addition to the nearly 25 million Americans who already have diabetes, there are another 80 million Americans - that's nearly one in four of us - that have unhealthy levels of fasting blood-glucose, also known as blood sugar.",
        "Doctors refer to this as pre-diabetes, meaning blood sugar isn't high enough to meet the cut-off for a diagnosis of diabetes, but it puts these people at high risk of developing the disease.",

        "But the process goes something like this...",
        "When people develop pre-diabetes or diabetes, their bodies become less efficient at responding to insulin.",
        "And insulin is the key to getting sugar out of the bloodstream and into places in the body where it's used for fuel.",
        "And the problem is when insulin sensitivity is out of whack, those processes become out of balance, and things go to where they don't really need to go.",
        "So how does cinnamon help?",
        "Well, it seems to help the cells in the body become more responsive to insulin.",
        "Now, Davis says, on its own the power of cinnamon to lower blood sugar is not huge.",
        "I mean according to our results, it's a modest effect.",
