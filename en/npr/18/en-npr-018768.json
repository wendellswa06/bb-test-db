        "So is dementia sort of a diagnosis of exclusion of other things or is there an actual physical manifestation that a doctor can test for?",
        "With - at that early stage, we - in research settings, yes, you can look at changes in the brain structure that you can see with imaging techniques or measure spinal fluid to see if protein changes are occurring.",
        "However, we don't use those routinely in diagnosis yet.",
        "This is the future.",
        "So right now, many - if they go to a research center, they're going to get a lot more testing than if they go a GP.",
        "And what might those tests consist of?",
        "Looking for abnormal proteins in the brain, like there's a substance of protein that's deposited in the brain in Alzheimer's disease called amyloid.",
        "And there are imaging techniques where we can visualize this amyloid in the brain.",
        "Or we also can measure it in the spinal fluid.",
        "So that if it's occurring, then you have a better handle on what's happening.",
        "If it's not occurring, then you really need to redouble your efforts to see if there's anything else that might be causing the symptoms.",

        "My brother was 58 when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease; has since been re-diagnosed as frontotemporal dementia.",
        "And I was wondering if there - if those amyloids are present in frontotemporal dementia and what some of the causes might be.",
        "He used to work on buses.",
        "He was a mechanic.",
        "He was the smartest guy I know.",
        "And he used to breathe a lot of the bus fumes and cleaning solvents and he did that for many years.",
        "I was wondering if that could be a contributing factor.",
        "Frontotemporal dementia is one of what we call a differential diagnosis for dementia.",
        "There - it's in that 30 percent that are not Alzheimer's disease that I mentioned.",
        "There's also vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia.",
        "There are several other kinds so - and they often get confused.",
        "And so it takes a specialist to sort that out sometimes.",
        "We don't really know what environmental influences do affect the development of these diseases.",
        "We suspect there may be some.",
        "However, there's - nothing has been nailed down yet.",

        "So high blood pressure in midlife is considered risk factor for Alzheimer's.",
        "Also genetics; you inherit certain risk factor genes that could cause earlier development of the disease and this is - it's like if you do get it at 59 rather than 60, it might be that the person who's getting it earlier has inherited a risk factor - a set of risk factor genes that will cause it to emerge earlier.",
        "Is there a specific genetic marker that can be tested for if someone chooses that?",
        "There is only in the - what we call the familial type of Alzheimer's, which is very rare, where there - what we say is dominantly inherited, where you actually inherit it from your parents.",
        "There you can actually see if the gene is present.",
        "The risk factor genes, you can profile people by measuring the - looking at their blood and so forth and the cells in the blood and decide if they have some of the risk factor genes.",
        "But they are not predictive necessarily.",
        "People can survive very well even if they do inherit some of the risk factor genes.",
        "They will almost 100 percent get the disease, however, if they inherit the dominantly inherited type which is the - usually very early onset.",
        "So suppose someone does receive a diagnosis like this, what is the next step?",
        "Is there - are there preventative ways you can slow the progression down?",
        "We don't really know that for sure.",

        "But it's about the difference between - you mentioned that you want to observe changes in your memory and that sort of thing to see if you might be developing early dementia.",
        "But, you know, my understanding is that as you age, 60 on up, there might be some changes simply because of, quote, unquote, \"\"aging,\"\" not because of disease.",
        "And I mean, is there any way to know?",
        "I'm 59.",
        "You know, the difference between maybe taking a little longer to remember things than you used to, like that movie you saw, et cetera.",

        "So, are there - is there any way to get some guidelines, the difference between aging, a little bit of memory loss and possible disease onset?",
