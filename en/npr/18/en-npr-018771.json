        "But now, at least, some of that stop and go may be over because a few weeks ago, a huge wind project, the Alta Wind Energy Center, finally started construction out there in the Mohave Desert in California.",
        "The location has some of the best winds out there in California, and when the project is complete, it'll be the biggest not just in California, not just the U.S.",

        "Of course, that increased recognition took a major setback a few weeks ago, when the climate change bill in Congress died, but I think there still is some momentum towards moving away from using coal and natural gas as our primary fuels to produce electricity.",
        "Ryan Wiser, tell us about this new wind, this huge wind project in the Mohave.",
        "How significant is it?",
        "Oh, it's very significant.",
        "This is a potential project of 3,000 megawatts in scale.",
        "To put that in context, the state of California, today, in aggregate, has 2,700 megawatts of wind power capacity online.",
        "So we're talking about the possibility of more than doubling that capacity with a single project.",
        "It is a phased project, though.",
        "It's not all going to come online immediately.",
        "However, half of that project is already under contract with one of the state's major electric utilities, did break ground last month.",
        "The first phase of the project has both financing secured, as well as wind turbines ordered.",
        "So the project, at least in its initial phases, is very much on track.",
        "And again, if developed, it will be the largest wind project in the world, at least temporarily, before some project beats it, and will more than double California's wind power capacity.",
        "Now, you've got to have, you have to have good enough wind for a project like this.",
        "Are there other places in California that are still available to develop?",
        "Oh, sure.",
        "We have a number of wind passes that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s.",
        "This particular wind project, in the Tehachapi area, sits in one of the areas with the greatest remaining potential in California.",
        "But there are many areas, as well.",
        "I would note that many of those areas will require new transmission lines to get that power out of those windy areas and towards the state's load centers, but there's certainly a lot of potential for wind that remains in California."

        "Borenstein, there was an AP story last week saying that since 2008, more than 20 coal-fired power plants have been built or are being constructed, the largest expansion of the coal industry in two decades, and using the old coal technology.",
        "As an older scientist, looking back at your years of young...",
        "Well, these were definitely not a movement towards more recognition of our climate problems.",
        "These plants are the old, pulverized-coal plants, which not only burn coal and produce greenhouse gases, but cannot really be retrofitted very easily to take advantage of carbon sequestration, if that technology actually is found to be workable.",
        "That is where the CO2 that comes out of these plants could be put underground, in underground caverns, and stored there permanently.",
        "Unfortunately, the plants that are being built really aren't a technology that can easily adapt to that option.",
        "So these are plants that are being built today, will exist for 40 to 60 years, and are planned to burn coal and produce CO2 while they're producing.",
        "It seems like in the last few years, and we've been talking about it on this program, we've spoken a lot about these large-scale solar-powered, these solar-thermal plants that use heat from the sun rather than the typical, flat solar panels we all see as photovoltaic.",
        "But I'm now hearing that photovoltaic is becoming competitive, cost-wise.",
        "Is that correct?",
        "It has come way down in cost.",
        "The panels, in particular, the actual production have dropped by more than 50 percent in the last few years.",
        "And that has made large-scale solar farms much more economic, and in fact potentially competitive with the solar-thermal technologies.",
        "The costs are getting very close.",
        "They're very different technologies, though, and they have different pros and cons to them.",
        "The solar panels, of course, need light but not too much heat.",
        "Heat is actually the enemy of a solar PV panel.",
        "The solar-thermal panels or the solar-thermal plants need heat, and so they love the desert.",
        "And they also have some advantages in that if the sun goes away through cloud cover for a moment, they have, they tend to be able to keep up production for longer.",
        "The PV panels, if you run into cloud cover, will almost instantly drop most of their production.",
        "So there's room for both of them out in the desert there."

        "There is.",
        "Both of them are still quite expensive, just to keep this in context.",
        "Even right now, both of them still if you don't count any of the environmental consequences cost about three times as much as a coal-fired power plant.",
        "Yeah, if I can jump in here.",
        "Sure.",
        "The truth is that in California, the state's three major investor-owned utilities have 16,000 megawatts of new, renewable projects under contract.",
        "Now, these are not projects that are all online, of course, yet.",
        "Many of them are still in the development stage.",
        "The vast majority of them are.",
        "Of those 16,000 megawatts, 7,000 are wind, 5,000 are solar-thermal, and 3,000 are solar photovoltaic, the flat panels that you referred to earlier.",
        "And so there is just absolutely no doubt, in the state of California, that large-scale solar-thermal project and, now, large-scale solar-photovoltaic projects are competing with wind on economics alone.",
        "Still somewhat more costly than other conventional energy sources in some cases.",
        "However, I would note that the California Public Utilities Commission has determined that of those 16,000 megawatts, about 50 percent of those projects have prices that are lower than what the California Energy Regulator calculates as the cost of a new, combined-cycle, natural gas generation unit in the state.",
        "So we're getting about half of our new renewables contracts and capacity coming in at prices that are competitive with fossil energy resources in the state today.",
