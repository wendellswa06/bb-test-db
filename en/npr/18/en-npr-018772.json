        "My position is that wind energy isn't near as green as people think it is.",
        "It takes there are nine parts to a wind turbine.",
        "Each part, from a port to the job site, takes a diesel truck to get there, plus two pilot cars.",
        "And it's $3 million to put one of those in the ground, plus it takes 300 cubic yards of cement to stabilize them.",
        "And each one of those, it takes a diesel truck to get it there.",
        "And if you look at the cost for each turbine, and it has to be replaced after 25 years, the wind energy is the most expensive way to generate electricity that there is.",
        "The cheapest is hydroelectricity.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Let me get a comment.",
        "Severin, Ryan, any comment on that?",
        "Well, on the energy use part, it's certainly a good question, and one that often comes up.",
        "The truth though is that there have been now tens and tens, perhaps even hundreds of studies, on this very question.",
        "And virtually every one of those studies comes to the same basic conclusion, which is that after about six months of operation that wind turbine has made up all of the energy that was used to produce it and install it.",
        "So certainly on the net energy output question, there's just is no question here.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Wind does provide a lot of energy to the system.",
        "What about the other states in the Southwest that get lots of sunshine?",
        "You know, like Nevada, Utah, places like that?",
        "Are we seeing the migration of solar energy to those places too?",
        "Or are they holding back, waiting to see what happens to California?",
        "We're definitely not seeing the level of commitment we have in California, in the other Southwestern states.",
        "Some of that, of course, is politics, and some of it is commitment that they've already made to coal.",
        "A lot of these states have access to a lot of cheap coal and have made big investments in that.",
        "So, well, these are, as Ryan said, in some cases can be cost competitive for the state, that's largely because of very large federal subsidies to these renewable energy sources.",
        "And I think there's still quite a bit of uncertainty about how long the subsidies will last and how effectively they will offset the higher costs of renewable energy."

        "Yeah, I would add to that, that a number of the Southwestern states certainly are not being quite as aggressive as California.",
        "That's partly because we have a much larger state with a much larger electricity load.",
        "But in virtually every one of the Southwestern states, there are obligations on these state's utilities to deliver renewable energy in the same way as there are obligations in the state of California for our utilities to deliver renewable energy.",
        "And increasingly in Nevada, in Arizona, in New Mexico - the utilities are turning to solar.",
        "And so there certainly are a large number of very sizable solar projects that are on the drawing boards in each of those states as well.",

        "Germany, Spain, Portugal, they've all beefed up their clean energy production.",
        "Is this something that we could emulate in this country, or do they have special situations that make it very difficult for us to follow them?",
        "Well, actually, I think that Germany, Spain and Portugal stories get presented in two different lights.",
        "And after reading quite a bit on it, I think the more negative light is probably the more accurate one.",
        "They have thrown huge subsidies at these technologies at a much earlier stage, in some cases, of the technology maturation.",
        "It's been extremely expensive.",
        "It started to drive up rates.",
        "And as these economies took a hit in 2008 and 2009, they moved away from these policies.",
        "As a result the new building of renewable energy there has been really very much curtailed.",
        "Now, one of the goals of building - of committing to renewable energy was the hope that as a result they would become the major producers of the technologies.",
        "And although there was some indication they're moving in that direction, as these technologies have become more mature and something that can be done in pretty standardized factories, we're seeing China, of course, move into that business and take over an increasing share.",
        "So in the European countries that have made these big commitments to renewable energy, I think there's now quite a bit of pushback on it, even from some people who are big supporters.",
        "And as far as an economic development program, I think it's largely been a disappointment.",
        "You know, I also think that to a certain extent we do have a different set of policies that are being used to support renewables here in the U.S., and so we're not going to emulate the European powers in the same way from a policy perspective.",
        "But I do think that those European successes do provide something we can emulate in terms of ambition.",
        "And the truth is, the U.S.",
        "has a better solar resource certainly than any of the countries that you just mentioned.",
        "Germany, the world's solar energy leader, has a solar resource that is somewhere equivalent to approximately Alaska.",
        "So given the solar resource that we have here in the U.S., and given the extraordinary wind resource that we have here in the U.S., as well, certainly the ambitions of some of those European countries can be followed.",
        "With all the production that's upcoming with solar and wind, you mentioned China in the formula.",
        "Is China going to be making all the parts?",
        "Or have we lost this alternative energy race, already, to China?"
