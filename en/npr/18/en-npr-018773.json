        "Federal incentives for renewables, historically, have been delivered to the tax code, requiring people who invest in those projects to have a good amount of tax liability.",
        "Well, a lot of the financial institutions that had that tax liability and were investing in wind and solar projects went bankrupt, no longer had profit, and therefore no longer had tax liability.",

        "And so one of the most important programs created by the Recovery Act and the stimulus money, was the program administered - now administered by the U.S.",
        "Treasury, to basically transfer the tax credit into an upfront cash grant.",
        "So the incentive is roughly the same cost to the U.S.",

        "If you talk to people in the solar and wind development, one of the big barriers has been that when they start to invest in these projects, there is some sort of favorable tax treatment.",
        "But by the time they start bringing it to market, either that has expired or it's up for renewal and the real questions, and that is also a huge barrier to this sort of investment.",
        "We've made some real progress in that area.",
        "Particularly...",
        "Well, that would go along toward a whole energy policy, comprehensive energy policy, which we don't' have time to discuss right now.",
