        "My question is, if I make the claim from the fund, is it your decision that they cannot file a law suit?",
        "And who has made that decision?",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "If you make a claim for an emergency payment from the fund between now and November 23rd, and you're eligible and you document your claim, you will receive that money without any waiver of any type on your behalf.",
        "Later on, next year or the year after or the year after that, if the fund offers you a lump sum payment for all present and future damage, only then would you be required to waive your right to litigate against BP.",
        "But between now and November 23rd, there was absolutely no preconditions on your receiving the money.",
        "Who made that determination, Mr. Feinberg?",
        "I made - the emergency decision of no waiver, I made that determination after the administration in BP asked me together, jointly - to set up this voluntarily program.",
        "Nobody has to participate.",
        "And if you want to participate voluntarily, those are the options that you would have.",
        "Do you consider that fair?",
        "Oh, I think it's fair in the sense that it's voluntary.",
        "No one has to - if you'd rather sue BP or anybody else, go right ahead.",
        "You don't have to participate in this program at all.",
        "It's purely voluntary.",
        "And secondly, I think it's very fair to tell fishermen and anybody else, between now and November, if you're in need of emergency financial assistance and you're eligible and you document your claim, you can receive that money without any waiver of any rights.",
