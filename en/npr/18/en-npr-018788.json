        "So we're finding a lot of earlier evidence of the entries we already have.",
        "But sometimes, as editors are going through a word, they just feel that there must be something better out there than they're able to see in the resources at hand.",
        "That would be our own files, online databases and corpora.",
        "And so when that happens, they can nominate a word to be included in the OED Appeals.",
        "And then - and that means we'll post it on the Appeals website, which is oed.com/appeals, and explain what the situation is, why we think that there may be earlier evidence out there.",
        "And then we leave it open in the comments for people to come forward and provide earlier evidence that they may be able to find.",
        "Well, what kind of proof does a contributor have to have in order for you to accept their tip?",
        "I mean, you were just saying you can call John le Carre, but that's not going to be enough.",
        "So what has to be there to accept the information?",
        "There has to be evidence that we can verify the data.",
        "So that can be something like - I've already seen since we launched the Appeals late last night, that someone has improved on our first example of Bellini, which is a cocktail made with peach juice and prosecco.",
        "Our earliest example was 1965, but we felt that it must be earlier, because we knew that it was the name of the drink, which was invented at Harry's Bar in Venice, was said to have been invented in 1948.",
        "And already, someone has found evidence in a book from 1956.",
        "So we're looking to get - to track down a physical copy of the first edition of that book.",
        "And once we have seen that physical evidence, that yes, it was there in this document that we can tie to 1956, we'll update our entry to reflect that as soon as our publication schedule allows.",
        "But it's not always that simple.",
        "A few years ago, the OED did an appeals program - although it wasn't called that.",
        "It was called Balderdash and Piffle, in connection with the BBC.",
        "And we issued a request for antedatings of words there.",
        "Antedating is the word that we used for an earlier example of a given word.",
        "And so one of the things that they asked to the listeners and viewers of the BBC to try to search for was an earlier example of something for the weekend, which is a coy British term for a condom.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "So - and this is exactly the kind of thing that it is very difficult to find documentary evidence of.",
        "We've had correspondents say: I know that in my barbershop there was a sign that said something for the weekend in the 1950s.",
        "But that doesn't count, because we don't have a - we can't tie it to documentary evidence.",
        "You have to have a dated photograph of that sign (unintelligible).",

        "Yes, exactly.",
        "But the - someone remembered hearing a Monty Python record that used this term back in - I think it was 1972, and that is datable.",
        "So we were able to use that, verify the date, listen to it, get a transcript and put it in the OED archive.",
        "And now - and that then constitutes something that's a reliable date for that item.",
        "Now, we'd still love to see it go back further.",

        "(LAUGHTER)",

        "I traced it back to the 1800s, that - where a document stated that the expression had come from the initials of a town named Old Kinderhook.",
        "And I'd have to, you know, dig through the - well, you know, now on the Internet.",
        "So that's not too difficult, but I'd have to look to see exactly, you know, what kind of document it was on.",
        "But I've always kind of wondered, you know, how that...",
        "Can I - this is - as it turns out, this is one of the entries we have revised in OED and...",

        "But in the latest theory on where old - OK comes from is that it's short for all correct, humorously misspelled.",
        "So there was a period of time in the 1800s when foppish young men, as a sort of slang amongst themselves, would spell things incorrectly.",
        "This is a little bit like what people do on the Internet today.",
