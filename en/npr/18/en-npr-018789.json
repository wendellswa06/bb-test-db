        "Back when we did it in print, once it was in print, even if someone sent us great, amazing new evidence, we couldn't do anything with it until we did another edition in print.",

        "But remember that since news is about the stuff that happens, it's not about the stuff that doesn't happen, you don't hear about all the parts in the world where civil wars have fizzled out and have not restarted and that's why even with the horrors of Syria the death rate in war has not gone up by very much.",
        "If I could just mention some numbers - during World War II, for example, the rate of death in war was about 300 per 100,000 per year, during the Korean War it was in the twenties, during the Vietnam war in the teens, during the '80s and '90s it was in single digits.",

        "On the other hand, there are certain categories of violence that are quite unpredictable and here I would not be willing to predict that the trends would necessarily continue.",
        "Civil wars are a lot harder to control than wars between countries.",
        "There are only about 200 countries in the world and that's a small number of actors to decide that war is a stupid way to resolve disputes.",
        "On the other hand, in a world of seven billion people there's no end to the number of popular liberation fonts that could pop up, get their hands on lots of semi-automatic weapons and create mayhem in some local part of the world.",
        "Likewise I don't think that terrorism is going to vanish because again in a world of seven billion people it's very easy for some disaffected, 25-year-old men to decide to raise hell and get a lot of attention to this or that cause, so very much depends on the category of violence.",
