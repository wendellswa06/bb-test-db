        "It began in 1998, and it was a way to showcase, by BCS standards, Bowl Championship Series standards, the top two schools each year.",
        "Now, it has worked, if you, you know, listen to what the BCS people say, because the last 12 years, you have had the one and two teams by BCS measurements - and of course some people, many people question whether those measurements are the way to go - you've had those teams meet for the national championship games.",
        "And so, you know, as you'll find out later talking to Bill Hancock from the BCS that this is the way to go.",
        "As you mentioned, it's you know, it pits the top two teams against the others.",
        "You have four other BCS bowl games that theoretically pit the top teams against each other.",
        "And as you also mentioned, it creates great interest and excitement in the regular season because, as I mentioned with Friday coming up, you know, you have this situation where you lose and you're out of the running, certainly with four undefeated teams right now up at the top.",
        "So it puts that much more there's that much more impact of a regular season game.",
        "And BCS proponents say that you would lose that if you went to a playoff.",
        "Yet there's going to be tremendous let's say that Alabama beats Auburn, which is I guess, at least in terms of most prognosticators, the most likely of the possible upsets.",
        "Of course anything can happen but if it does, you're going to have a lot of people arguing that then one-loss Alabama should be considered to be one of the top two teams in the country, as opposed to Boise State or TCU, who play a much easier schedule.",
        "Well, certainly, and the Southeastern Conference is considered if not the top, one of the top power conferences in the country.",
        "And there will be those arguments.",
        "But the defenders of TCU and Boise State will say: Sorry, you know, we're still undefeated.",
        "We've run the table and one of us, at least, deserves to be in there.",
        "And this is they are not from BCS conferences.",
        "There are some conferences that automatically qualify.",
        "Right.",
        "The teams from the top, from the six BCS conferences, the major conferences, including the PAC 10, Southeastern Conference, Big 12, two or three others, six of those conferences are automatic qualifiers.",
        "And Boise State and TCU, being from the Western Athletic Conference and the Mountain West Conference, respectively, those are non-automatic qualifiers.",
        "And only one of those can only one of those teams from those conferences, the non-automatic qualifiers, can get an automatic bid.",
        "So that's why, as we look at these top four teams, actually the fight between Boise State and TCU is such a big one at this point because the team that ends up third will get that automatic bid, probably, and the other one, even though they may have an undefeated record, they would have to go in as an at-large team because only one team from those non-automatic qualifiers can get into a BCS bowl game.",
        "Are you following this, Neal?",
        "I am following this.",
        "But on the other hand, I've been indoctrinated for many years.",
        "So I think I've figured it out.",
        "So that's why the fight between TCU and Boise State and they are separated now by .0135 points according to the computers, is so key because, you know, Boise State can leapfrog TCU and get to three.",
        "That would mean Boise State would get an automatic bid to a BCS bowl, not necessarily the national championship bowl.",
        "TCU, being number four then, could get left out."

        "Right, yeah.",
        "And I think Toby raises an interesting point, though, is that, you know, playoff proponents say look, you can still keep your bowl games.",

        "But you can keep the bowl games, and we will kind of fold those into a playoff system.",
