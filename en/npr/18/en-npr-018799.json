        "So I sort of said, OK, I've got to get the oil changed in the van, do a stress management workshop and find a neurosurgeon.",

        "Unlike Kennedy, she didn't have surgery.",

        "Everybody dies of this.",
        "But what else could she do?",
        "With two adolescents at home, Durham embarked on the treatment course that is similar to the one that Kennedy will probably get.",
        "But unlike Durham, the Senator will probably get radiation and chemotherapy at the same time, instead of one after another.",
        "Recent evidence suggests that prolongs survival.",
        "Durham's response to radiation and chemotherapy was spectacular.",
        "After a year's treatment, she and her husband went to Bachelor to hear the results of her latest MRI scan.",

        "Well, since she has aligned herself with the Bush administration with working first on the Security Council for the first Bush president, George, Sr., she has made herself very comfortable within this particular group of leaders - as Phyllis described them, the neo-cons - who she has really been very much in close affiliation with as far as her policy outlook, the way that she has evolved her career as a policymaker.",
