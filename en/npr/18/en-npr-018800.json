        "His performances were often rants against authority and censorship.",

        "You know, what are these words that I'm talking about?",
        "They're just words that we've decided, sort of decided, not to use all the time.",
        "That's about the only thing you can really say about them for sure, that they're just some words, not many either, just a few, that we've decided, well, we won't use them all the time.",
        "Sometimes, well, hell yeah, sometimes it's okay, but not all the time.",
        "And they are the only words that seem to have that restriction.",
        "Well, it's interesting reading the book because for someone who was always wanting to push forward and try something a little edgier and have some progression of what he was talking about, he talks a whole lot about his past and particularly reminds you pretty regularly that he was an Irish street kid.",
        "Right.",
        "Thanks for having me on.",
        "That's George Carlin's \"\"Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television.\"\" Before his death, Carlin spent 10 years working on a memoir with longtime friend and writer Tony Hendra.",

        "Although he apparently hated the term autobiography, as only the pinheaded criminal business jerks and politicians wrote autobiographies.",
        "He used a word other than jerk - which reminds me, Carlin used a lot of foul language, so if you call in to quote your favorite routine for us, please remember you are not actually George Carlin and so please do clean it up for our audience."

        "What's the term you want to use - sorta-biography?",
        "Sorta-biography, yes.",
        "It was actually because in the course of it, as you pointed out, George didn't want to call it an autobiography.",
        "He also didn't want to call it a memoir, which we decided was a linguistic mongrel of me and moi.",
        "So that was a bit too egotistical.",
        "And in addition to that, he had asked me to write these kind of historical interstitial pieces that would place George in historical context throughout his more than - eventually more than 50-year career.",
        "So we decided it was part biography and part autobiography and therefore we would call it a sorta-biography.",
        "How did you meet him?",
        "I actually first knew him in the �60s because we were both, I was a comedian also at that time and we were both scuffling around the Village trying to make it in television.",
        "And we, in fact, remained competitive friends -friendly competitors perhaps throughout the �60s, doing the same dreadful television shows, you know, and the same nightclubs like Mister Kelly's and the Hungry i and so on, until he basically became completely disillusioned with the repression of �60s television, as did I.",
        "And then we sort of parted company into different directions.",
        "Then I met him met again, when I was doing a book called \"\"Going Too Far,\"\" which was a history of modern satire.",
        "And it - this was the mid-�80s and he was now in the top rank of people I wanted to interview, and in large part because he performed 99 percent of the time live.",
        "And part of my premise in this book was that this kind of radical humor that I was examining had always had a rather adversarial relationship to television, as defined obviously by the piece you've just sampled.",
        "And you know, if anyone, if anyone got this it was George, who obviously, you know, very deftly defined that adversarial relationship in that piece.",
        "And then we found that we were, in doing - in the course of doing my interview with him I just found a tremendous rapport with him, despite our obviously different backgrounds as you can probably tell from my accent.",
        "And that we shared a lot of tastes, a lot of, you know, sort of ideas and analyses about humor.",
        "But in general we just had a tremendously good time.",
        "We laughed a lot.",
        "And what had been a kind of casual acquaintance gradually become a close friendship.",
        "And when George got the autobiography bug, as so many people do after they turn 50, he asked me to help him write it."

        "Stephanie, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I have a funny story.",
        "Years ago, I mean, before I even knew I was a linguist, I heard a piece by George Carlin where he talks about growing up in New York City and how that, you know, all the kids, you know, inevitably all of the white kids would imitate the black kids.",
        "He said, you never once would hear a black kid - a black boy say, hey, let's go down to the drugstore and get some ice cream sodas.",
        "It was always, you know, the white kids going, say, man, let's get on down to the drugstore.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "And I always tell my students about that when I teach them about black English.",
        "So George Carlin as a linguistics teacher.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "He is, I mean, he talked - I heard a piece after he died, I heard a piece and he was talking about how his mother used to trick him.",
        "He would - you know, she would tell, she would - he would use - he would say something and she'd use a word and he said, what does that mean?",
        "And she would make him look it up and then and he would - she would always continually give him new words to learn.",
        "And he just - and while he wasn't - he didn't call himself a linguist but he was, like you say, he's a lover of words.",
        "And he really pinpointed the whole sociolinguistic nature of kids talking, you know, was a lot more fun to talk, you know, to talk, you know, like the black kids than the white kids.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Actually, I think Stephanie has a really interesting point there, because George was very - he loved it when academics would want to use his routines in their - you know, in their papers.",
        "Or when he was, you know, when he was asked if he could - if someone could quote him, who came from a university or something.",
        "I mean, he was a ninth grade dropout, which might have had something do with that.",
        "But I think there's a deeper point here, which you also touched on, Stephanie, which is that in a way, certainly in his maturity, I think, George, although he probably, in fact, he didn't really like the word very much, but he definitely was a kind of wild teacher, and one of the reasons that he did that, or rather the sort of rationale he - not rationale, exactly, but the explanation for that, was that he said when you make people laugh, there is no moment in their lives, especially if it's live, when their minds are more open, and you can change people's minds, you can implant new information at that moment, just that second after the laughter begins.",
        "And I think that's actually what he was - he was very bent on doing that in many ways, and so, you know, the teacher thing is really, I think, a really interesting insight.",
        "And so there's this kind of constant reminder of where he came from, even as he's pushing on where he's going.",
        "Right, exactly, and I mean, that's - at the risk of ethnic clich�s, I mean, both his mother and his father were first-generation Irish, and you know, they both were apparently - well, certainly his mother was, you know, wonderfully verbal, and herself had a great, had a great sort of command of words, was very funny."
