        "Mr. Hendra, you mentioned that you'd developed basically from kind of a friendly competitor to a real close friend over the years.",
        "Right.",
        "What I was wondering was - the personality he displays during his performances and movie appearances is pretty consistent, kind of acerbic and high-stress.",
        "Right.",
        "What was he like as a just day-to-day friend?",
        "Well, he was actually - you know, this kind of almost rabid sometimes curmudgeon that he played on stage was rather belied by the way he was off stage, which was he was very approachable and very, very amusing.",
        "I mean, he wasn't amusing in quite the same way that he was on stage, but he did say, and says in this book several times, that he was very nice to people for, you know, quite a considerable length of time, anywhere up to a minute and a half."

        "Right.",
        "Probably the ones he had were real close, though, I imagine.",
        "Yeah, I think that's true to say.",
        "He had a few very close friends, but I always found him just a delight to be around, and we had, as I said earlier, we had just a terrific time having these conversations and discovering a lot of stuff about comedy that neither of us knew.",
        "We have email from Heather in Port Clinton, Ohio: My sister and I still recite his bit about the good scissors.",

        "It's either breaking your neck or putting your eyes out.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, he also has a great description of being on Sullivan and how the audience was all dolled up and nervous, and so they laughed at nothing, and Sullivan would stand just off-camera, but on stage, laughing at nothing.",

        "He was at the Abscess(ph) show in San Francisco, and I'm just - my question was: Do you think that he actually believed in God, or I mean, what are your thoughts on that?",
        "Well, my considered assessment would be no. He certainly believed in what he called the big electron, which is - by which he meant the entire universe and all the carbon atoms in it with which he identified.",
        "But as you probably know, George gave up worshipping God at a fairly early stage, and later in his life he decided that he would start worshipping Joe Pesci, because Joe Pesci looked like a guy who'd get things done."

        "They taught me to be sufficiently intelligent that I could no longer believe in their faith.",
        "But on the other hand, he really, he really respected the nuns who taught him, and for the rest of his life he actually sought them out and was very nurturing to them, very friendly and kind.",
        "He didn't at all have that sort of response to nuns that so many of us who were raised by them ended up having, the sort of, you know, Sister-Mary-Ignatius-explains-it-all-for-you kind of nun.",
        "He - in fact, he tells this wonderful story in the book about how when he first did - first sort of made his big breakthrough and \"\"The Seven Words You Can Say on Television\"\" was everywhere, his mother came to see the show, and his mother was just appalled by, as you can imagine, by the seven words that you can never say on television.",
        "And a few days or weeks later, she ran into some of the nuns from Corpus Christi, because she lived on the same street, and the nuns said: Isn't it great about George?",
