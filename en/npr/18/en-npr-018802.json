        "I just love him to death.",
        "I just - I get everything that he does and just every record and video, whatever's available, and I just love the guy so much.",
        "He was really an innovative, really great, great mind, great comic mind, and one of the best.",
        "He and Lenny Bruce made it all different for everybody, but...",
        "...George was a great guy.",
        "Concerning his Catholic beliefs, he said something to me one time that has always stuck in my mind.",
        "He said he had heard Joe Kennedy, the father of the Kennedy boys, say something to the effect that he sent his daughters to Catholic University so that they would learn the fear of God.",
        "He sent his boys to Harvard so that they would know the difference.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Okay.",
        "I must say one thing about that, Jorge, which is that Jack Burns was an immensely talented man.",
        "And he actually went on to do, I think, just George was too much of a solo performer to be in a comedy team.",
        "And he went on to do a wonderfully funny comedy team with a guy called Avery Schreiber in the mid-�60s, and then to an illustrious career as a television producer.",
        "How big an influence was Lenny Bruce on you and George Carlin?",
        "Well, as I say in my introduction to the book, Lenny Bruce was who we all wanted to be when we grew up.",
        "And certainly, his - the risk-taking and actually this - he also had an amazing facility with and love for words.",
        "I mean, the way Lenny used words was very much like the way George used words in these kind of jazz-like riffs that he would go into.",
        "And both those things, both the element of daring and the element of this extraordinary ability to spin, weave webs of word were things that we both wanted to emulate.",
        "I think George actually took it obviously much more seriously because he really felt he owed Lenny a debt.",
        "For one thing, Lenny actually got him started on his career.",
        "But he also was told by several people that he was the heir of Lenny Bruce.",
        "And right until the last years of his life, he was very aware of that, in fact, if anything, a little burdened by it because he was never sure that he'd really fulfilled the legacy which Lenny had kind of laid on him.",
        "But I assured him several times that he had.",
        "And I think that's - I think the one thing you can say about the two of them is that Lenny became a legend because he had the good sense to die, whereas George went on living and actually probably achieved more, I would say, than Lenny Bruce did in his lifetime.",
        "And certainly, had a breadth and a range and an artistry that I think Lenny would have envied.",
        "My guest is Tony Hendra.",
        "He is co-author with George Carlin of Carlin's not-memoir-autobiography called \"\"Last Words.",

        "And Beverly(ph) in South Carolina says, one of my favorite routines was about stuff, how we all collect our stuff and have a place for our stuff and how hard it is to go to someone else's house to stay because there's no room for your stuff.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, \"\"A Place For Your Stuff\"\" is one of those classic routines which George came up with.",
        "And I think, again, when you listen to that piece, it's almost like a litany.",
        "I mean, there's - you can hear this - it's not a chant, exactly, but the constant repetition of stuff just becomes funnier and funnier.",
        "I mean, not that litanies are usually very funny.",
        "But the other aspect to it - and George always had this kind of two-track ability - the other aspect to it is that it really is this delightfully whimsical but very essentially serious essay on consumerism and how we all have stuff, and we need more stuff and our house is just a cover for our stuff.",
        "And we need more stuff because sometimes we lose our stuff.",
        "And we don't want people stealing our stuff especially the shiny stuff, and so on.",
        "I mean, it's just a masterpiece of a very gentle satire.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",

        "You know, it wasn't necessarily predictable who he was going to attack.",
        "Well, I agree.",
        "And I think this piece, actually, \"\"The Planet Is Fine,\"\" is one of my favorite pieces.",
        "And it was a breakthrough piece in my mind in much the same way that the \"\"Seven Words\"\" was because it was the first piece he really tried - or rather first piece he performed that to me convinced me that I was lucky enough to be working with a really great artist.",
        "And its vision, I wouldn't say, is either liberal or conservative.",
        "It just goes beyond the whole environmental debate to say, the real problem here is the arrogance of humankind, that the arrogance that treated the planet in such terrible way in the first place is the same arrogance that says we can save it.",
        "When a planet, in fact, isn't in any need of saving, it will just simply get rid of us, which is an insight so profound that you can't but be challenged by it.",
        "It's also - another thing about that piece is that - this is the way he described it to me - is that he discovered at that time in his career a very -an incredible, incredibly valuable thing.",
        "He said that he realized getting laughs was not his only responsibility, that his other responsibility was to engage his audience's mind for 90 minutes.",
        "And I - again, to return to this theme, I think that's why I think he is probably the greatest comedian I've ever heard and possibly America's greatest comedian ever.",
        "Do you believe that because Facebook is a free service that the company has the right to use information about its users as it wishes?",
        "Everything was normal the day before.",
        "We have an email from Todd(ph) who says, growing up in rural Arkansas where the thought of gun control was considered blasphemy, I loved his bit about the guy that hijacked some news station with a toy gun.",

        "Although he - you know, he's very open about growing up in what he called a Hearst-Westbrook Pegler-Joe McCarthyite household.",
        "And it was indeed the aforementioned Jack Burns who put him straight about that.",
        "But nonetheless, he - I don't think - although he always described himself as being on the left of the spectrum, he also was a complete non-joiner.",
