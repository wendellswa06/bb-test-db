        "Yes, you know, I grew up Southeastern Ohio playing football and that was my love and what I wanted to do.",
        "And I tried to make my son a football player.",
        "And when he wasn't having that, you know, he used to follow me to - I used to bring him to some pick up basketball games I - I used to play.",
        "And I saw he had a love for it.",
        "And just like any father, I just wanted to be involved with my son and it led to all this.",
        "And when did your son meet LeBron James?",
        "Wow.",
        "I think the first time, you know, they were adversaries for the first few times they saw each other, first in football.",
        "Drew did play one year of football and, you know, LeBron's team dismantled his.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And then the next year, they faced each other in a recreation basketball league in Akron and they were on two opposing teams.",
        "And, you know, those games are very highly contested games and once we put the team together, that's when they became friends.",
        "But at first, there is - it was an adversarial kind of relationship.",
        "And, LeBron James, tell us a little bit about that.",
        "You call him, Little Dru, the general.",

        "I mean, you say confusion, but when a lot of people signed up to Facebook, you know, they didn't necessarily know that all of those things they filled out, gender and marital status and age and the jobs they had, they didn't know that all of that would one day be used to build profiles for advertisers.",
        "With Facebook, they're not actually selling users' information, which is, I think, the number one misconception out there.",
        "They're not giving away any kind of information to advertisers.",
        "What they're doing is they're selling targeted advertising based on the information they have about you.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, they're sort of building kind of categories of people.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, they're building demographic profiles about people, the same as any program you watch on TV has a demographic profile about who watches the television show.",
        "The difference is on the Internet, you can be more targeted.",
        "I mean, you say that they're not passing along our personal data, our individual profile data, to advertisers, but as you know, and as we just heard on this program, they were doing this as late as last week, whether it was inadvertent or not.",
        "So why is it enough for us to just trust that Facebook will never pass along or sell our individual data when, you know, we all know it has the power to do that?",
        "Well, I think there's a couple of interesting things here with the Wall Street Journal article that we heard about.",
        "For one, what Facebook was doing there and what other companies were doing in this instance was something that wasn't specific to advertisers.",
        "On the Internet in general, when you click a link, it shows the website to which you go to where you came from.",
        "So in this case, because you came from a Facebook page, in some instances, your user ID, which is something Facebook considers public, would be passed on to any website that you clicked a link to go to that website.",
        "But then that advertiser can use your user ID to find out what public information you have out there, and a lot of people don't really know that they don't have that hidden.",
        "Well, there's two things.",
        "First of all, they can only find out public information about you.",
        "Second of all, no advertiser has said they've done this.",
        "And third, this would actually go against Facebook's terms of service for its advertisers.",
        "So if any advertisers did this, they would actually be breaking the terms of service with Facebook.",
        "But we know that Facebook can do that.",
        "I mean, they're saying this was a software bug, but we know that they can do that.",
        "Is it enough for us, the users, to just trust Facebook, or should there be some kind of regulation?"

        "I think what we've seen is there's a very narrow group of people, privacy fundamentalists, that value privacy over all other values.",
        "And what they want to do is set a single standard for all users that's imposed by government.",
