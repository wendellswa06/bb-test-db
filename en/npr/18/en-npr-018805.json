        "Well, it's a great pleasure to talk to both the coach and LeBron James.",
        "I came from a team that in seventh grade, or junior high, we lost two games in three years, and our senior year, we were a top-ranked team that lost in our district first game.",
        "So we had to enter the bracket from the back side, and it was the adversity that I wanted to - that was so interesting in the early part of this show, dealing with adversity, when you're supposed to win a game, and you don't, and then how do you comprehend that game and then make use out of the mistakes.",
        "And anyway, Coach, I guess I'm directing that more towards you.",
        "How did you deal with those games that went the wrong way and then come back and persevere?",
        "And also, my question for LeBron James is: LeBron, you look like you enjoy playing D, and I was a defensive specialist.",
        "I rode the pines, but I could play tall, even though I was only 6'1\"\"…",
        "Well, if you read this book, Joe, you may find that a little bit amusing, because it took a while for LeBron to appreciate the finer points of defense, as I think Coach Joyce might point out.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah, and answering your first question, as far as how do you bounce back, you know, I think that one thing that as a coach that, you know, I've grown to and I've learned is that, you know, losing is part of it, you know?",
        "You're going to lose some games.",
        "And, you know, you don't want to lose them, but you're going to lose some.",
        "And, you know, I just try to, you know, do this.",
        "When we lose a game, you know, I'm looking for a couple of positive things to bring out of it and then we're going to move on.",
        "You know, the past is the past.",
        "And I think the one thing that I talk to my guys all about, even in the midst of a game, after a game, you need to stay in the present moment.",
        "You can't change the past.",
        "The future is not promised.",
        "Stay in the present moment and work with that moment.",
        "And you know, I just think it does wonders for kids when they understand and they know that you're not going to beat them up about a missed play or a missed pass or a bad shot that, you know, something LeBron and he'll respond to.",
        "You notice it's very sensitive?",
        "We had - you know, and they used to tell this to me in the huddles.",
        "We used to have a saying, when someone was stuck on a bad play, we say, next play.",
        "And that was - the idea was to move - let's move on.",
        "And I think that's what you got to do.",
        "Of course, you want to correct mistakes, but you got to move on and stay in the present moment."

        "And to go on and answer the second question, I think - I just really, you know, I came to find out that the game of basketball is just - is won on both ends.",
        "I think it's all about pride.",
        "Defense is all about pride.",
        "You know, you're standing across from the other guy and you - I basically go into a game saying, I don't believe you can score me.",
        "And it's going to happen.",
        "Just like Coach Dru said, losses happen and you're going to lose games, but, you know, I just really believe that the guy in front of me is not going to score me.",
        "And, you know, and it's not just individual defense but at the same time I feel like I'm helping - I'm always try to help my teammates become better.",
        "Because offense is easy.",
        "Offense becomes easy when you played a defense on a higher level.",
        "And I just - I found a new love for the game when I decided I was going to be, you know, not just the MVP on offensive end but on the defensive end also.",
        "LeBron James, I have to say, for you, offense is easy (unintelligible).",
