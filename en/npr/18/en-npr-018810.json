        "First and foremost, I think it needs to be looked at in a political context and what we are saying is that the Kenyans on both sides of this divide, President Kibaki and rival Odinga, need to talk to each other and they need to work out a political way forward for the country.",

        "Now, today, in his swearing-in remarks, President Kibaki extended his hands, said he was reaching out to all Kenyans, to AfriComm, and today, rival Odinga made a very good statement, calling all Kenyans to reject violence and emphasized the need for peace and to emphasize the need to follow the rule of law.",
        "So we're hopeful that those statements will help to further calm the situation in the day or two ahead.",
        "The violence in Kenya has been breaking down along ethnic lines -President Kibaki from the Kikuyu tribe and rival Odinga is a Luo.",
        "And there are reports of tribal gangs going from house to house, dragging out victims.",

        "There have been instances, certainly, of violence between these groups.",
        "The imagination runs wild when you think of those things.",
        "There have been people killed as they say, but this is not something again to mask tribal violence or slaughter along those lines.",
        "And to be very frank about it, I believe this violence that has occurred has actually jilted Kenyans.",
        "And it's jolted the leadership of both sides as well.",
        "And in a sense, it sobered them up.",
        "And I do think we're starting to see indications that they realized the need to come together for the good of the nation as a whole.",
