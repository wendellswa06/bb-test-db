        "Some 30 percent of Hillary's supporters said they would be reluctant to support Obama.",
        "I suspect that as we get closer to November that will change, but there is a passion gap, as you say, with McCain supporters.",
        "A lot of conservatives still say that he is not the real-deal, they're weary about him, and they're looking at other options for November.",

        "But what about the argument that the Obama camp, and a lot of other Democrats, and they didn't need more than the Democrats, that well they're not making it safer and they're - the Republican Party is - the Republicans in power have, you know, campaigned on the idea that they've prevented attacks.",
        "Right, exactly, and that's why both sides - I mean, it's too easy to say that, yes, it helps McCain, just like I think most Democrats feel that if gas goes up to five dollars a gallon, which seems to be headed towards that, that has to help the Democratic Party.",

        "Chris Cannon is perhaps one of the most - certainly, not perhaps - one of the most conservative members of congress.",
        "He's from Utah, first elected in 1966, very, very conservative, but he supports President Bush's decision on immigration, in to allowing illegal immigrants to get this guest-worker program to help them find jobs.",

        "Indeed, there was a report that he had a closed door meeting with some Latinos in Chicago this week, and told them, behind closed doors, that look, I'm not going to press this in the campaign, but I'm still committed to comprehensive immigration reform.",
        "And Tom Tancredo, the retiring Republican congressman from Colorado, got wind of it, and said this is just a betrayal.",
        "So obviously that's the dilemma that John McCain has.",
        "He feels that obviously reaching out to Hispanics, Latinos, he can open up the chances for Republicans to get more votes.",
        "But at the same time, conservatives, as we saw in Utah's third district, are very, very wary, and angry about this kind of politics.",
        "And we're going to be focusing this week, and when we come back, we want listener calls on the question of do you care that Barack Obama broke his promise to take public financing during the general election phase of the campaign, and how is it going to change the campaign?",
        "But as you look at this, this has got to be an interesting calculation for somebody who said he would very aggressively pursue an agreement with a candidate McCain to make sure that they both accepted public financing.",
        "That's true, but at the same time, I mean, a lot of people argue, make the case, that having 300, perhaps 500, million dollars at his disposal, how do you turn that down?",
        "There are a lot of good government types, and we'll probably hear from some good government types today, who feel that this is a betrayal of trust.",
