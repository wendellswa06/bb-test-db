        "Now, that's the kind of money and individuals organizing it that has caused problems in the past, and that's why today, for example, a group of eight reform organizations, including my organization, Democracy 21, has sent a letter to both Senator Obama and Senator McCain and asking them to make very specific disclosures in the future, for this rest of this campaign, of each bundler who is raising 50,000 dollars or more, and the cumulative total amount that person is raising because those individuals are the kind of people who will get more access and influence than the rest of us.",

        "To have America to go through almost a minor catharsis in terms of venting their interests, or lack of interest, their racism, or lack of racism, it's going to be amazing, and I think he needs that money to do that.",

        "Yeah, no, it changes the equation, Ken, and good to speak to you again.",
        "It changes the equation significantly on how you play the electoral map because there are two factors.",
        "It's not just the money that Barack Obama has, but it is trying to measure and gauge accurately the people he's going to bring to the polls on Election Day.",
        "And so that's a double whammy that we've never faced on our side of the equation here, and no one really has a clear answer for it or how to deal with it, and we're almost in a situation where we're forced to be playing catch up in the sense of trying to figure out where he may catch up.",

        "No question.",
        "One of the things I think that everybody fails to realize is that, you know, when Barack Obama says, or when his campaign says, he has one and a half million contributors, that is very impressive.",
