        "I just wanted to say that I think it's pretty unfair to characterize it as Obama breaking his promise to accept public financing.",
        "The questionnaire that everybody, you know, says is where he committed to it.",
        "He wrote a fairly lengthy qualification statement saying that he would accept public financing if he could get his Republican opponent to agree to do the same, and if he could get his Republican opponent to agree to try to limit the influence of 527 groups on the election.",
        "And as I understand it, he could not even get Senator McCain to sit down with him.",
        "And also, Senator McCain has shown very little indication that he's going to try to reign in anybody.",
        "The 527 groups, Fred Wertheimer, those are outside organizations.",
        "Five twenty-seven is the part of the electoral code under which they qualify, the tax code?",
        "Yeah, the interesting thing about 527 groups is that most of what they do is illegal, and we just haven't been able to get the enforcement agency to effectively enforce the laws.",
        "In 2004, my organization and some others filed complaints at the FEC against a number of these groups for breaking the law, for spending money in federal campaigns without complying with federal laws.",
        "Three years later, the Federal Election Commission found that just four of these groups, just four, had spent 200 million dollars illegally in the 2004 presidential campaign.",
        "But that came three years later, and they fined them roughly one percent of the expenditures.",
        "So we did not have effective enforcement, and now we see these groups doing the same thing in the 2008 election."

        "It's not clear that they're going to spend the same kind of money in 2008 that they spent in 2004, but the real problem here is if you had these laws properly enforced, you wouldn't be seeing the 527 groups operating the way they're operating.",
        "Ken?",
        "Fred, if there are all these 527 groups who are breaking the law and spending hundreds of millions of dollars, then doesn't that support the Obama argument that the general that the campaign finance system is broke and that, you know, by staying the rules does him no good if so many other groups are not following the rules?",
        "You know, I don't think so.",
        "I can't I think the amount of money in the general election, not the primary, for the candidates, plus the amounts of money that the parties are going to raise, if he - if Senator Obama turns his attention to raising money for the Democratic Party, he would have an enormous amount of money very quickly.",
        "I think that's more than enough to compete in the presidential election, but I'd also point out that Senator Obama knew all of this in November of 2007 when he signed that commitment.",
        "I think his commitment was significantly tighter than has described here.",
        "By the caller, yes.",
        "But again, you know, politicians make political decisions, and they do it all the time, and that's what we're seeing here.",
