        "How would you do away with that?",

        "In other words, don't wait for the trouble, intercept it.",
        "But that requires care across the continuum, integration, and we don't have those structures in America.",

        "It basically keeps in place the public programs, Medicare and Medicaid, and expands them a little bit.",
        "And then it gives people - it mandates people you must be insured, but it also organized the health insurance market.",
        "So there is like a farmer's market - they call it the connector -through which you can buy insurance so that when you have a preexisting condition, you're not totally out of the picture.",
        "And there are attempts to control health care cost a little better, although that's iffy.",
        "And there are subsidies for lower - middle-class people who cannot afford the premiums.",
        "What the problem of the Massachusetts plan will be is that it will cost more money, more government money, than Governor Romney had anticipated.",
        "I think he knew it, but just didn't say it.",
        "And I wouldn't have either.",
        "You don't scare people with a plan like this.",
        "You run into it and then you explain to people why it costs more.",
        "But I think that is a doable plan.",
        "As I understand, the Hillary - Senator Clinton's plan, it is really very much like the Massachusetts plan except for the nation as a whole.",
        "And Governor Schwarzenegger's plan is also like that, which means you keep most things in place as they now are and fill in the gaps, which is quite different from radical plans like Victor Fuchs and Ezekiel Emanuel, who basically want the government to do all of the financing and then you get a voucher to buy your own private health insurance.",
        "And I think Dr. Kotlikoff also has a similar plan.",
        "Those plans have actually been around since 1972, when Paul Elwood first proposed it to President Nixon and the - read in at Ann Summers(ph) at Princeton at that time proposed similar ideas.",
        "The idea government raises our taxes, gives you a voucher and you can buy with it at your own private health care purchaser and regulator.",
        "That is a private insurance company."

        "What would it cost per year to implement something like that?",

        "If we really want to do what's moral, which is cover everybody, we're going to have to swallow hard and change care so it becomes affordable.",
