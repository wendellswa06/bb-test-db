        "While, if you go to Minnesota or Wisconsin, they practice a more conservative style mainly because they use primary care physicians more.",
        "Those data has been assembled by Dr. Jack Wennberg and his associates at the Dartmouth Medical School for at least two decades, and we know also states spending per capita on health varies enormously.",
        "So if healthcare is cheap, you can get it cheap health insurance policy in Wisconsin.",
        "The reason that it's cheap is they buy health care in Wisconsin.",
        "If that same Wisconsin insurance company had to buy health care in Boston or in Philadelphia, their policies would cost pretty much what a policy costs in Blue Cross Massachusetts or in Blue Cross Pennsylvania.",
        "I have heard Newt Gingrich advocate why can't we purchase health insurance across state line, and I wish the Congress would just say, all right, go ahead.",
        "I agree with you, but you know, it…",
        "The Americans would learn nothing would happen.",
        "Changing it - we have to simplify insurance.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Correct.",
        "Well, let's go ahead and try it.",

        "If you divide America into fifth, all the market areas, the difference between a lowest fifth of expenditure and the highest fifth of expenditure is $3,000 or $4,000 a year.",
        "The Dartmouth Group that Uwe is referring to has studied quality and asked the question, well, what do you get for the extra 3 or $4,000.",

        "And they found an inverse relationship, which means where we spend a lot, the quality of care was actually lower.",
        "And the argument was it deemphasizes primary care there; people wait too long until they get too sick, and then you have super specialists who do ever-conceivable tests and charge a lot.",
        "And so the irony is that the cheaper care, as Dr. Berwick said, is actually better care.",
        "And Dr. Ralston made that point as well when he said we need more primary care doctors.",
        "And sadly, if you look at the Dartmouth data, it seems like we ought to be producing more primary care doctors as a nation.",
        "Yet, if you look at the senior survey that the American Association of Medical Colleges does every year, there's been a dramatic decline in increase in internal medicine, family medicine and pediatrics at least in the general scale.",
        "And we need to be figuring out ways to redesign the system to move toward those high-quality, low-cost models of delivery that Dartmouth has so effectively pointed out.",
        "One of them…",
        "Do we have fewer doctors because they hear of these horror stories about becoming a doctor and dealing with the health care system?",
        "Well as a full-time generalist, I will certainly say that there are many positive things about my work.",

        "Well, let me ask you…",
        "All the strong-performing systems in the world are very strong in primary care, and very good use of nursing.",

        "So, let me ask you this question.",
        "Is the reason why they are doing better and doing it more cheaply because they have a single unified system in each one of those countries?",
        "I believe yes.",
        "Fragmentation is the enemy here.",
        "And anything that unifies effort, the teamwork; the idea of working in teams, as Dr. Ralston said, is sole key.",
        "The best of the early HMOs, the one of the few that's still endure sort of had closer to the right answer that we've ever had in America because there were integrated systems, they had a limited budget, which is a good thing, and they were able to allocate resources where patients needed it.",
        "And when we - what we find systems that are able to do that kind of integration, they do perform better."

        "In over Dartmouth, Massachusetts, it's very hard to get a good primary care physician now, right, because we do not pay primary care physician enough money relative to what physicians can make being radiologist or oncologist.",
        "And so if you have young persons coming out in medical school with a bundle as that, and there face a choice of being in a low-paid primary care of pediatrics or geriatrics or internal medicine or GP, or becoming a radiologist, of course they're going to, more likely, take the highest-paying specialty.",
        "Here, I blame government.",
        "Medicare has to be the leader in paying better for primary care, even if it had to come at the expense of controlling a little more what gets paid to the specialist.",
        "And the government hasn't done it.",
        "We have a research project in our work, which we call a triple aim, where we're saying what we really need is the actors that can do three things at once - improve health care, make it far better - like we're talking about on the phone now - improve health status, because we haven't talked much about prevention, smoking, accidents, injuries, depression, violence, and reduce per capita cost.",
