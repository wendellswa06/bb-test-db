        "For instance, the Committee of Economic Development recently came out with a plan that had been substantially written, I think, by our colleague, Alain Enthoven, at Stanford.",
        "And he had always looked to employers to be the major sponsors of health insurance, but this plan, he now proposes, doesn't have employers in it.",
        "It is, basically, again, a voucher plan where the government would raise the financing, and then people would have vouchers to pick different competing HMOs.",
        "I mean, basically, he's persuaded to the prepaid group practice model, the integrated system Don Berwick talked about.",
        "And I think more and more people are coming to the realization that 10 years from now that the role of employers in American health care will be much diminished.",
        "Smaller business units will be simply out of it.",
        "Only the huge corporations like G.M., G.E.",

        "In fact, they're begging for help on these things from the government because they - it drives the price of their cars up in comparison to Toyota (unintelligible) in National Health Insurance and has paid by the people rather than buying cost of the car.",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "When the country, Sweden, is spending 3 or $4,000 per capita, and we're spending 6 or $7,000, you can imagine the difference in our economic viability and global market place.",
        "And this is - Americans just have to get used to the idea that in the coming decade, the role of government in financing health care in America will inexorably grow no matter who runs the show - number one.",
        "Now, you may use private insurance as purchasers.",
        "As most of these health plans - Senator Biden, Senator Edwards, Senator Clinton, Senator Obama - they all use private companies as purchasers, but there will be heavy government regulation, because government is not a patsy.",
        "They will insist on performance, including quality measurement and reasonable prices.",
        "So people who dreamed to get government out of health care, they are dreaming.",
        "Government will increasingly intrude no matter who runs the country.",
        "And if Republican gets president?",
        "Same thing.",
        "It's just the - there's no choice.",
        "Smaller business would say, we can't deal with this anymore.",
