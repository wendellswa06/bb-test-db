        "This is actually the first couple of times that I really started doing some bigger donations because I wanted to get notoriety for my energy company.",

        "So Parnas made some mistakes with that contribution.",

        "It is an incredibly rigorous, tight structure that dictates how the universe evolves in ways that we wouldn't have anticipated, but it is so precise and specific about what it allows to happen and what it does not allow to have happen, and it doesn't allow the kind of crazy stuff that Lawrence and I get manuscripts about daily from people who you're describing in their garages who are just thinking up these nutty ideas.",
