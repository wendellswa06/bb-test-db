        "He's cranky, he's a bit bumbling, seemed very believable.",
        "How did you come up with that character, very human?",
        "I was at a climate change conference just outside Berlin.",
        "A Nobel - of course N-O-B-E-L - and I got to - I was invited, I was just like the dessert to the dinner, to give a little after-dinner speech.",
        "So I was floating around with very little to do, and I found myself in a room with 50 or 60 Nobel Prize winners in science who were addressing climate change.",
        "These were the alpha males, the big beasts of the savannah, very grand.",
        "Science - any real, original science was very far behind them.",
        "What they had done to get them their prize they probably did in their post-doc years.",
        "And I thought how interesting it would be to have a man living in the shadow of his former self.",
        "So out of that came Michael Beard, and since we're talking about climate change, I made him a compulsive eater and getting fatter and fatter through the novel, not completely hopeless at relationships.",
        "He thinks he's very attractive to women, and often thinking so can get you there, or so he thinks.",

        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "But the point is round about that time, the Copenhagen Conference, just as I was finishing this novel, and that was taking place.",
        "I wanted to catch how very stupid very clever people can be.",
        "And I think that says something about humankind in general.",
        "If we look at climate change itself, we have fabulous resources of rationality to see a problem coming towards us, and we also have at our disposal oceans of stupidity in dealing with it politically or socially.",
        "And I wanted to catch all that in one man.",
        "You did a very good job, and I'm sure - we're going to take a break.",

        "And you wonder sometimes whether you're a fraud when, you know, you're representing science, and people always think - they always have to say that everyone is the next Einstein, or everyone is - and it's not true.",
        "And I think it's easy to believe press clippings, that's a part of it, but it's also really important, I think, to try not to misrepresent the science, and that maybe we'll get to because that's really important.",

        "I don't even remember.",
        "No, I was talking about the fact that, you know, there is a tendency to answer any question you're asked, first of all whether you know anything about it or not.",
        "And the real problem is that people will believe anything we say.",
        "We could say, forget whether string theory has anything to do with reality, but we could say inside quarks, we could say there are little pink elephants, and people would believe it.",
        "So you have to be very, very careful, I think, if you're representing science, to not knowingly misrepresent.",
        "We all do, because when you write about science, you have to approximate it at some sense, and I'm often surprised when people write to me and tell me what they got out of my books.",
        "You probably have the same thing: It's not what you wrote.",
        "But you shouldn't knowingly mislead.",
        "But there's a tendency to want to please everyone and answer every question.",
        "And sometimes, you know, people want to know about - they want time travel to be true, and it's sort of very tempting to want to please them by going along instead of saying you know what, this - or quantum mechanics, you know, this won't happen.",
        "It's very difficult.",
        "I don't know, I give just a slightly different flavor, which I think you agree with, as well.",
        "Although people may come at you with a certain predisposed wish that some aspect of the world is one way or another, if you explain how it really is, it's often more exciting than the thing that they wanted to be true in the first place.",
        "I mean, so there may not be these crazy things of, you know, of being able to affect things with your mind in the way that I've seen some nonsense talk about, but quantum teleportation, being able to take a particle here and in some sense make it appear over here almost instantaneously, well, that's pretty spectacular stuff.",
        "In fact not only that - I agree with you, having, you know, I wrote a book that had something to do with science fiction once.",
        "And the point is that science fiction pales in comparison.",
        "The real universe is so much more fascinating than the universe of science fiction.",
        "And that's why we have to keep - by the way, we sit in rooms and think of things, but it's not good enough because whatever we come up with is going to pale in comparison to the real universe.",
        "We have to keep looking.",
        "We have to keep doing experiments because theorists alone just won't capture the real depth of the universe.",
        "Ian McEwan, do you think - we have two great - here on the stage, we have two great science communicators, Lawrence Krauss and Brian Greene.",
        "And they are great at communicating.",
        "But do you think there are some fields that get no attention because there are not good communicators, they're sort of neglected in the press or in fiction because there's no one to speak for them?",
        "Well we - I think we have lived through a golden age of science writing in the Anglophone world, at least.",
        "I mean, you go to France, there's none, it seems.",
        "I think the subject that has a tough time underrepresented is chemistry, and it's waiting for its Milton, its Shakespeare.",
        "Somehow chemistry we think of as a sort of smelly, gaseous, 19th-century science, and yet it's been going through its own intellectual revolutions.",
        "And we really need to hear more from them, I think.",

        "Why did you choose to become a scientist?",
        "Well, that's a good question.",

        "But one was because I read books by scientists, actually, and about scientists.",
        "When I was a kid, I read a book about Galileo, when I was about your age, actually, and it really - I thought wow, you know, this is brave stuff.",
        "And then I read books by Einstein and Feynman, people who are my idols, and they excited me about the universe.",
        "And frankly, that's one of the reasons why I write books is to return the favor so when someone like you becomes a scientist and maybe says hey, you know, being on this show inspired me, then I can feel a little bit better about it.",
        "Yeah, for me it was to get the girls.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "That's what it was.",

        "And it just struck me that look, there can't be an answer because otherwise everybody would already know it, and someone would have told me about it.",
        "So it must be the case that the best you can do is understand the question, not why but how.",
        "How did the universe come here?",
        "How did the Earth form?",
        "How did life begin?",
        "And it struck me that if I could get close to the questions, that would be the best substitute for finding the answers, and that's really what science is all about, getting close to the questions.",
        "Brian, do you agree that we should teach more of the questions.",
        "I often think we tend to teach too many facts, but we should - but it's the questions that kids are interested in.",
        "And so we should be teaching, and we try in fact in the Origins Project...",

        "Just open that book, and Science tells us this, right?",
        "Yeah, and it's really a process.",
        "And we really - and one of the reasons I think that we have a problem with education in that regard is that frankly it's hard to talk about the process and not the facts unless you're comfortable with science, and we don't - many of our science teachers aren't trained in science.",
        "And it's easier to teach to the curriculum and the facts instead of being open-ended and doing the process if you're not comfortable with it.",
        "Brian, you're taking a stab at a children's book, correct?",
        "I did, yes.",
        "I wrote a kids' book called \"\"Icarus at the Edge of Time,\"\" which is a rewriting of the myth of Icarus, where the boy doesn't have wax wings and go near the sun, but he, against his father's warning, takes a small spaceship that he built and goes to a black hole.",
        "He goes to a black hole in a spaceship.",
        "Yes, and there's it's Einstein's general relativity, the real science that dictates what happens.",
        "And to make a short story even shorter, time slows down near the edge of a black hole, so when the boy comes back, he only spent an hour there, but when he comes back and says Dad, what do you think, his dad's been dead for 10,000 years.",
        "And this is what would happen if you spent time near the edge of a black hole.",
        "And I dedicated the book to my son, who was five at the time, and I didn't want to read it to him because I didn't want it to be like oh, there's Dad's book again, you know, that sort of thing.",
        "So I left it around and let him find it on his own, and my wife read it to him, and he was crying at the end.",
        "And somebody asked me, well, didn't that make you feel bad.",
        "And my answer is yes but no. I mean, if general relativity can make a five-year-old cry, that's a good thing for science, right, because science is - like Lawrence is saying, it's something that is something that should grab us fully emotionally, and that's like one step in that direction."
