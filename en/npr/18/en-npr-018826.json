        "But Ian, isn't that the whole point, make you feel something?",
        "Well, Kierkegaard said something useful about this.",
        "He said intellectual delight - and this is a paraphrase - intellectual delight is recapturing the solemnity of a child - the seriousness of a child at play.",
        "So I think what's true of science is probably true of all intellectual pursuit that's worthwhile, and it has a playful element.",
        "But children at play at their best are deeply serious.",
        "So it has that element, too.",
        "How do scientists treat something differently than other novelists and writers you hang out with?",
        "Well, I have to tell you that in the humanities generally, pessimism of all sorts is a kind of delicious meal.",
        "So if I'm with my humanities friends, we talk about civilization going to hell in a handcart, and that's the subject.",
        "Now among scientists, they would also concede that it might be going to hell in a handcart, but they are also saying, what can we do about it?",
        "There is an innate optimism in science, which you don't find in the humanities.",
        "There's very little celebration of pure being in the departments.",
        "Often they're very constructivist, they're very hostile to science in some ways.",
        "They think it's - they think the Enlightenment was a great mistake.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "This is some quarters.",
        "And so it's refreshing for me to step out of the gloom of the humanities and come and spend time with people who are trying to not only solve things but understand things as if for the first time.",
        "And also recognize a good microbrew when they see it, most of the time when I'm around them.",
        "Yes?",

        "UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I mention that because I've been involved in it about 15 years, at least, and you're looking for seeing excitement and enthusiasm in science.",
        "I mean, it's there.",
        "It's - just watch it, and you'll have a story.",
        "I mean, 15 years ago I could answer about half of the questions.",
        "Earlier this month, I think I answered three out of the two contests.",
        "Well, you know, it's more than that.",
        "Brian - you know, we both supervise students, and I think one of the most exciting parts of being - of continuing to work with students is watch them, you know, when they start, especially Ph.D. students, there's a lot of input.",
        "And afterwards, you know, they're teaching you, and it's really a satisfying experience.",
        "So we both had it, I'm sure.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Brian, would you consider your book science fiction, that novel?",
        "I wouldn't call it science fiction.",
        "I call it science in fiction because it really is the core science just put into a fictional setting.",
        "So it's just what we were saying before, but the story is now something which is made up, but the science is still solid.",
        "But it sounds a little bit like Margaret Atwood, who writes - she says I'm not a science fiction writer.",
        "I'm a speculative fiction writer.",
        "Everything that happens in her novels is possible, may already have happened.",
        "So they can't be science fiction and she says, which is fiction is - which things happen that are not possible today.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, she's great, and I'm a great fan of hers.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You have been, in some circumstances, I was reading, blurring the lips of people as they speak so that there could be no ability to even read lips to transmit what might be indecent language that way.",
        "But I think that isn't a good description of what I'm describing here.",
        "The science of what happens near a black hole is widely agreed upon in the community.",
        "It's virtually unassailable from the standpoint of how we understand gravity and Einstein's general theory of relativity, no speculation whatsoever beyond the fact that the story itself is something which is made up.",
        "And, you know - but there is - and, yeah, I was going to - I agree completely with Brian.",
        "If you - but those ideas are very fascinating if you can include them in a milieu like he did with the book and the musical that's associated with it to seduce people to - you know, because they may not read about a black hole otherwise."

        "But the - but there's not that much difference, in my mind, between, you know, science and drama or music.",
        "And that's the point we need to convey, and that's part of the purpose of this weekend, is that science is a cultural activity, and it's to be enjoyed by everyone as much as a great novel or a great symphony.",
        "And the difference often is - often I'll get asked, as a theoretical physicist whose work has no practical application whatsoever, which I'm rather proud of, why?",
        "And I say, well, you know, science isn't just technology.",
        "It's ideas, and people don't ask why a Mozart symphony - you know, what it's going to - whether it's going to make a better car or a better toaster.",
        "Ian, why do you put science in your books?",
        "What - why do we have to know about quantum mechanics?",
        "Are you purposely doing that to teach us something or just to...",
        "No, absolutely not.",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "It just came along with the character.",
        "It's a reflection of my own pleasure in it, but it seems just a human enterprise.",
        "I mean, this is - I mean, the standard measure of how alive you are is the measure of your curiosity, and I think of science as organized curiosity.",
        "We once relied on priests to tell us the shape and nature and purpose of the cosmos and life itself.",
        "It's been a long, slow story of that undoing.",
        "We now have a far more interesting story, and it's also penetrated our lives.",
        "I mean, there's climate change, and we all have these intricate, beautiful machines in our hands, and it's impacting on our decisions about bioethics and many other things.",
        "So if we think of the novel as an investigation of the human condition, technology and science is now so woven into that condition.",
        "You cannot escape it.",
        "So it's inevitable, I think, that...",
        "It belongs there because it's all around us.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And if you're interested in investigating where we are in human - the human state as things stand, in the conditions of modernity that we find ourselves in, you cannot do this without taking some regard or a lot of regard for science.",
        "Let me go - final question here from the audience.",
        "Quickly, yeah.",
        "UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: What is the likelihood that we'll be able to transcend our predisposition towards superstition?",
        "Well, it's something - well, it's something that I spend a lot of time worrying about.",
        "And I think ultimately I think we'll be able to transcend it not only when we just have a better story - which we do, because science is a better story than myth and superstition and all those things - but it's also when we can use that to address the things that myth and superstition provide, like consolation, community.",
        "And I think we have to think more carefully about how we can use rationality and an empirical worldview and, in fact, recognize that science is a very spiritual endeavor, in spite of the fact that people - some people think it killed spirituality.",
        "We have to do a better job of usurping those things that have been already usurped by people who wear dresses in the Vatican...",
        "All right.",
        "Let me remind everybody, this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow here with Lawrence Krauss, Brian Greene and Ian McEwan.",
        "We're talking about science and how to portray it in fiction or the best way to do it.",
        "Lawrence, did you want to - you want to further - I interrupted you, so I wasn't sure you were done...",
        "I thought you were cutting me off because I was getting into territory...",

        "And if we - and we need to let - force our beliefs to conform to the evidence of reality, but it doesn't diminish us.",
        "You know, again, Feynman talked about seeing - understanding how a rainbow works doesn't make it less beautiful; it makes it more beautiful.",
        "And as I said recently in another media event, science, the spirituality of science - when I look up at a Hubble Space Telescope picture, I get awe and wonder and spiritual fulfillment, but it's better than the spiritual fulfillment of the Bible because it's real.",
        "That's it.",

        "I take the...",
        "Ian?",
        "I take the opposite view.",

        "Christianity alone, 2,000 years is quite - is pretty good going for a thought system, however flawed.",
        "So clearly it's answering to some need.",
        "And the problem for us atheists is to come to terms with the fact that billions of people on the planet take comfort from it.",
        "Communality, world views, cosmoses and so on.",
        "But Ian, but I agree with you.",
        "But that was my point.",
        "We have to understand why it's so prevalent if we want to find out ways to provide those things to people, and if we can't provide those things in an alternative way, then it won't ever change.",
        "But I happen to think we can provide - science can provide a communal understanding of ourselves, and we can - I could imagine ways that we could provide those things in a secular way.",
        "All right.",
        "All these things give me a, kind of, a gut feeling that we are in a period of - not of us to have a specific threat, you know, that I have in mind right now.",
        "But then we are entering a period of increased vulnerability.",
        "I guess my view - forgive me for half a second - is it's a very disturbing thing to be thrust on to this planet and trying to understand why we're here.",
        "And if religion helps you get to terms with that, that's great.",
        "If science does it, great.",
        "And I just feel like let people believe whatever makes them feel good.",
        "And over time I think science ultimately will win, but I don't think we have to root it out.",
        "So I have a slightly different view."
