        "And in my early 20s, I kept thinking I'd made the wrong choice and wondered whether I should go back and do a biology degree.",
        "And what stopped me, actually, in the end was - we were beginning a silver or golden age of science writing.",
        "And around about that time in the early to mid-'70s, Richard Dawkins' \"\"Selfish Gene\"\" came along.",
        "I then read \"\"The Double Helix,\"\" which I think was - and still in my mind - one of the best accounts of the contingent nature of science and the competitive nature of it and the messy nature of it.",
        "It's a thrilling account of the first description of the DNA molecule.",
        "And by the '80s, I felt, well, I don't need to go to university.",
        "I can just appreciate this torrent of books coming from all sides, written now not only by journalists but by scientists themselves.",
        "So that's - it's been a good outcome for those of us who wanted to live in both camps.",

        "Yeah but, hang on.",
        "Plenty of scientists go through 10 years of college without reading Shakespeare.",

        "And your answer would be?",
        "Well, I think that if - coming back to what I said earlier, if you think of - to take literature alone, this as an investigation to human nature and you look at the cognitive revolution of the last 30 years and the way the life sciences, biological sciences, have spilled out onto the terrain of the novelist.",
        "We discuss, now, consciousness in ways that - it was a forbidden subject.",
        "We look at motivations and emotions, which are, of course, right in the domain of the novelist.",
