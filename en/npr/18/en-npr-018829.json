        "Well, we haven't spoken together in about five - four or five years now, and it's not by my choice, but - so, through the press, or just through putting the message out there that I'm very happy for her, and that I want, you know, nothing but happiness.",

        "And we have within us all the tools that we need to overcome whatever personal obstacle, or whatever global obstacle, we may face.",
        "So I really wanted to start the record off giving people an idea of where my - not only where my mind is at, but you know, really where my heart is at.",

        "And that's essentially a pretty apt description of Australia's stolen generations, which are basically aboriginal, mostly aboriginal, but some Torres Strait Islander people that were removed from their families as children, essentially from probably, you know, the early 1900s right through until about 1970 under government policies and laws, and it was certainly governments that enabled aboriginal children to be removed from their families.",
