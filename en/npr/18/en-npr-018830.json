        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "The way that the FCC becomes involved is if a viewer complains.",
        "And so in the case of San Mateo, there was a single viewer that had complained in that market, contacted the FCC.",
        "That's what triggers the process.",
        "So that's how it works.",
        "The interesting thing about the \"\"Saving Private Ryan\"\" ruling, which was one of the questions that I had when I met with some of the commissioners, is that it is hard for us to understand the precedents that are being set, which is how we base our decisions on what, you know, what we can and can not do.",
        "Because in the case of \"\"Saving Private Ryan,\"\" you have a piece of dramatic work where someone wrote those words and put them in the mouths of actors.",
        "In the case of our documentaries, we have people telling their own stories.",
        "And so for me, the conflict here is \"\"Saving Private Ryan\"\" was okay.",
        "That was a fictional piece of work.",
        "It was a very powerful film.",
        "The Martin Scorsese documentary was on blues musicians, and them using the language, their own language, to tell their own story is not okay.",
        "And I don't see how you can, you know, align those two cases.",
        "What did they say to you in response?",
        "They said that they felt that \"\"Saving Private Ryan\"\" was a singular event, that it was a powerful story, and they didn't feel that the same standard applied to Martin Scorsese.",
        "So they were responding in terms of the quality of the broadcast?",
        "I was.",
        "Because?",
        "I cannot tell you.",
        "They felt that \"\"Saving Private Ryan\"\" was appropriate, that's how they ruled on that, and obviously they have seen \"\"The Blues\"\" as a very different story.",

        "Oh, hi.",
        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "I just have a comment, and that is that public television, by its very nature, is supported by the public.",
        "We call in on pledge and let you know what kind of programs we want.",
        "I think if there were a public outcry, that would be one thing, but we are paying the money just like we would pay for a premium cable station.",
        "And I personally have been watching television for more than 50 years.",
        "I can't find anything on television that's better than what the public television programs offer.",
        "And I think that the FCC should get out of it, and I also think that - wasn't there some issue last year or the year before that the federal money was not going to be forthcoming or that it was going to be cut substantially for public television?",
        "And anyway, that's my comment and I'll take my comment off the air.",
        "Thank you.",
        "All right.",
        "Just to say, I think the government sees broadcast television as quite a distinct category from cable, which you opt for.",
        "Yes.",
        "Certainly pay cable, which you decide.",
        "Pay cable, and just to be clear about this, pay cable operates under very different restrictions than over-the-air.",
        "Over-the-air is deemed public airwaves and so the FCC has jurisdiction.",
        "Pay cable, because you are purchasing pay cable, that is not under the same obligations, which is why you can watch the same words we're talking about on \"\"The Sopranos.\"\" But you cannot watch those words on public television that's broadcast over the air.",
        "And what about the funding cuts issue that she asked about?",
        "The funding cuts issue was certainly a very real challenge for both public television and public radio last year, and that was a huge issue.",
        "Because the public signaled their support to members of Congress, we were able to restore those funds.",
        "This year, we are under a bit of the same issues, but not as severe cuts.",
        "But still, every year we have to fight to keep our funding.",
        "And let's talk to Rich, Rich calling us from Mount Shasta in California."

        "Paula Kerger?",
        "Well I think what we've seen over, certainly the last - look, I've been in this business for almost 14 years - and up until this past year, there was a great deal more latitude of the kinds of stories that we can tell.",
        "Obviously, we are very careful with programs that are geared for children.",
        "Obviously, when we broadcast programs in prime time that are geared for a more adult audience, we flag those programs.",
        "But when these recent rounds of rulings came through right after the Super Bowl incident, we actually were in the position of re-editing works that we had aired multiple times before.",
        "So this is a very new interpretation of the rule.",
        "And also, if you remember, the original ruling of George Carlin in the - I guess was that late '70s, early '80s - there has been a change in what words were then not appropriate and are now allowed.",
        "So it is a moving target, it is not static - and I think the way that the language has been interpreted is that we are supposed to use our judgment based on community standards - and that is a moving target.",

        "In most cases, it was part-aboriginal children or children who had mixed heritage, and these children were essentially removed because there was a prevailing belief that because they had some non-aboriginal heritage, that they perhaps could be effectively salvaged or that they might be able to be educated and to become so-called worthy, you know, members of Australian society.",

        "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians do, for the most part, I believe, identify as black Australians.",
        "But I guess it's more - here in Australia, some people are reluctant to leave it at black because they say it's not just about our skin color.",
        "It's also about our first-nation status.",
        "I guess we short-hand it to say that we are black Australians, but people generally prefer to be known by their language group.",

        "That's a really interesting question, because it has come up, certainly, in the context of this national apology.",
        "I personally feel, and a number of people that I have spoken to - aboriginal people - have said to me, before this day - and they're talking about the day of the national apology - I never felt Australian in a sense of the, I guess the modern Australian kind of identity.",
        "I've always felt like an aboriginal person from this country.",
        "I've identified with my traditional country, but not in a sense that I'm an Australian because Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people suffer series of levels of disadvantage in all sorts of social indicators: health, housing, education, employment, etc. And it's those sorts of things that I guess make people feel as if they are included in Australian society.",
        "This apology, you know, has obviously generated a lot of debate about whether, as a symbolic measure, as a gesture, it will achieve any real, practical outcomes for aboriginal people.",
        "And there's been a broader discussion about whether, you know, we should concentrate on the symbolic or the practical."
