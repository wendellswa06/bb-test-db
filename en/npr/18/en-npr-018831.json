        "Aboriginal people don't see why they should have to choose.",
        "If you had to choose something, even something small, that this struggle has given the world in terms of knowledge about how to resolve differences or knowledges about how to negotiate these constraints that people have put on each other in this growth of human society, what has your experience as an Australian, the experience that led up to this apology offered to other people who are looking around at the struggles over indigenous rights and race and ethnicity in their own countries?",
        "I would just have to say - I mean, it's been a real eye-opener for me as an aboriginal person.",
        "Aboriginal people have grown to be extremely cynical about the words of government, about promises that are made.",
        "The fact that there has been this consultation - and it was an unprecedented level of consultation - we, the members of the stolen generation, people who were literally removed, were asked, what would it personally mean to you if we apologized?",
        "The government was at pains to say we asked the people that this apology matters to most.",
        "I mean, the words of the prime minister that you played were part of it.",
        "He also apologized very specifically for the removal of aboriginal kids, for breaking up families, for the indignity and degradation inflicted on a proud people.",
        "That acknowledgement is just absolutely massively powerful for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.",
        "It says you acknowledge our experiences, where previously, you know, I know - older members of our community who are in their 60s and 70s have said to me I have been through my entire life looking into the eyes of white Australians, and I know that they think I'm a liar.",
        "Now to have people being validated, after, you know, six or seven decades of that kind of denial is exceptionally powerful.",
        "On that note, Kirstie, thank you for your time.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "Kirstie Parker is the managing editor of The Koori Mail, a newspaper that covers Australia's national indigenous issues, and she joined me from Lismore in New South Wales, Australia.",
        "A crash last month of a Russian rocket carrying a cargo ship to the International Space Station has NASA re-evaluating whether or not to send more astronauts to the space station, and it's possible they may actually evacuate the station altogether, at least for now.",
        "There are six astronauts at the station.",
        "Three of them are supposed to leave next week and be replaced at the end of September.",
        "But with the shuttle program a thing of the past, the station relies on Russian rockets to get people and cargo to the station."

        "Well, good afternoon.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Well, the progress has been very, very reliable.",
        "And its booster system, the Soyuz, has also been reliable, carrying not only cargo but crews to the space station.",
        "And I was also surprised that this happened so soon after the shuttle was retired.",
        "That was surprising to me.",
        "Is this all just coincidence then?",
        "Well, I believe so.",
        "You know, there's an investigation under way that is Russian and, you know, you just never know.",
        "You really have to bore down in these sorts of things and look for not only the direct cause but maybe contributing causes.",
        "There might be little subtle things, changes, something that entered the big picture of success that led to a problem.",
        "Is this the same rocket that would carry astronauts?",
        "It's very, very similar.",
        "There are some differences in the third stage, and that's the stage they had problem - problems with.",
        "But they're essentially the same.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "The investigation the Russians are doing, have they come to any conclusion so far, what caused it?",
        "None that they've disclosed.",
        "They pointed to a problem with a gas generator, perhaps.",
        "And they're looking for wreckage in a very rugged terrain in Siberia.",
        "And the weather has been bad.",
        "It's wooded, mountainous.",
        "And it's uncertain whether the wreckage would actually help, so it might be more of a data chase.",
        "But the gas generator is part of the turbo system in the rocket engine.",
        "That's an important part."

        "Well, if you're going to space, you want to get all the way there if you can.",

        "You don't want to get halfway into space, right.",
        "I agree(ph) .",
        "So what is - is there a real fear now that, well, we shouldn't go and we should - once those astronauts come back, we shouldn't send anybody until we know what actually happened?",
        "Well, if you look back at the way things have operated in the past, you don't launch more astronauts on the Soyuz until you know what happened and you have a way to fix it and you test the fix and make sure that you really have found everything and you know what happened - you have a good story - and then you can decide to proceed.",
        "So right now we have six people on the space station.",
        "Give us the plan of what's going to happen with that.",
        "Well, three crew are coming back on September 15th to 16th.",
        "They'll undock and land on the 16th in Kazakhstan.",
        "Those guys have been up - will have been up for 163 days.",
        "There's an American and two Russians that will be coming back.",
        "That will leave the station with three people.",
        "And they're supposed to come back on November 16th after a similar stay.",
        "And at that point, before they come back, that's really the time where the Russians and NASA and the other partners will have to make a decision to extend them or bring them back and leave the station unstaffed, hopefully temporarily.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Is there an effort?",
        "Have people said, you know, we still have the old space shuttle around, maybe we should pull it out of its minor mothballs that it's in and take it away from those museums and bring one back or something?",
        "Well, I think that horse is really out of the barn, unfortunately.",
        "And I'm not sure - you know, there's some discussion about whether that would really help.",
        "The Soyuz plays many roles.",
        "It takes astronauts up and back, but it also stays on the space station as a lifeboat, so that if you had some sort of a problem, a - let's say a fire or a piece of debris slammed into the space station, someone got critically ill, they could come back quickly on the Soyuz.",
        "The shuttle could not stay docked to the station and perform that lifeboat function.",
        "It's limited to maybe a 20, 22 day mission to the space station.",
        "So while it would certainly be nice to have the shuttle, it might not solve this problem.",
        "It probably wouldn't.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So they're going to be bringing the lifeboat back with them with the next bunch of astronauts leaving?",
        "There'll be three crew still aboard the station - a Russian, an American and a Japanese - and they will also have a lifeboat.",
        "But if they come back, there'll be nobody on the station, and of course no lifeboats until another crew launches.",
        "What about - we had Elon Musk on a few weeks ago talking about SpaceX and his plans to launch his first cargo to the space station in November.",
        "Is that a possibility, using that craft?"

        "And of course NASA is the managing partner.",
        "But the other partners, there's 15 nations, they all have an investment or a stake in the space station, so there's a lot of interest in handling this right.",
        "And the U.S.",
        "would like to show, demonstrate its leadership in working with the Russians and the other countries so that in the future, if there are missions planned for the moon or asteroids or Mars, that the other partners will continue to look to the U.S.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Yeah, give us one.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, let's go back right about a year ago.",
        "It was late July of 2010, and an external cooling pump on the space station - a device that circulates an ammonia coolant through a big outstretched radiator on the outside of the space station - failed.",
        "That meant that you couldn't cool a lot of the electronics on the space station, so they had to bring the amount of power down, approximately half of what it would normally be."

        "We're all on TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "In order to fix that problem, two astronauts carried out a series of space walks rather quickly in August of 2010 to replace that pump.",
        "They were fortunate they had a spare already on the space station, but that's a kind of thing where an astronaut is key to recovering a, you know, a vital system.",
        "Another concern of mine, although I think that the concern has fallen, would be the gyroscopes, and these are the big four flywheels that spin thousands of RPM that steady and guide the space station as it goes around the Earth.",
        "They're electrically powered.",
        "If you had a major power failure and you couldn't spin those gyros, then you have to go to a fallback and that's the Russian Progress, and the fuel it brings and the fuel that's onboard the space station where you can fire thrusters to steady the station.",
        "That fuel, though, is depleted as you have to steer the station and soon it has to be replaced, and that's a Progress function.",
        "And the Europeans also have a spacecraft called the ATV that can supply the space station with fuel.",
        "But, again, you're relying on a backup that's driven by the amount of fuel.",
        "And if you're having to fire a lot of jets to steady the station, you're using fuel faster.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "So right now the U.S.",
