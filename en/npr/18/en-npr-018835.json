        "Yeah.",
        "It is a setback in the sense that there will be more fear now, more anger, anger and fear on the part of non-Muslims but also on the part of Muslims who will become more and more defensive about, you know, the reality of Islamophobia in their lives.",
        "Nonetheless, I think it's important to realize that there are many reasons for why something like this crime could've happened.",
        "Not the least of which is that, you know, these young men, who were petty criminals to begin with, had become hardened and calcified by a much older man who gave them a narrative that, you know, suggested that the world is out of control precisely because of the pluralism I just talked about.",
        "In other words, these crimes, you could say, were a backlash against a more progressive future.",

        "Oh, listen, you know, women have been key in the emergence of extremist movements for, frankly, you know, at least a decade and more.",
        "Look, there is an interpretation of Islam that tells us that women historically have been a huge factor in the winning of global jihad or at least in the winning of Jihad.",
        "And so these women are likely sort of feeding off of that interpretation and of course twisting and manipulating it to a more destructive end.",
        "But at the same time, people like me, reformist Muslims see how strong women historically have been in Islam; see, for example, that the Prophet Muhammad married a woman 15 years his senior.",
        "She, you know, proposed to him, and she was a self-made merchant.",
        "The point being that we reformist Muslims have our own role models as well.",
        "And frankly, it is our challenge and our opportunity to step up, speak out even more for reform, and the opportunity and challenge of media outlets like this to listen.",
        "At the center of all of this, of course, are larger questions about limits to free speech.",
        "And, of course, the terrorists were acting, they say, in retribution for cartoons that the magazine published of the Prophet Muhammad.",

        "Very briefly, I can tell you that there are plenty of passages in the Quran that defend freedom of conscience and even freedom of disbelief.",
        "And in fact, there are three times as many passages in the Quran calling on us to think and reflect and analyze and rethink, rather than merely submit blindly.",
        "So yes, it's up to people like me to, you know, to advocate bold and competing reinterpretations of Islam.",
