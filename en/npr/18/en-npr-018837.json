        "This is NPR News.",
        "Novelist Gloria Naylor is best known for writing critically-acclaimed, African-American literature, including the Women of Brewster Place.",
        "However, Naylor's latest offering falls into that ambiguous category some call fictionalized memoir.",
        "Once more, this somewhat true personal story is centered around Naylor's conspiracy theories about government surveillence and mind control.",
        "The book is titled 1996.",
        "That's the year it first became apparent to Naylor that she was being spied on.",
        "Since many of these things did happen to the real Gloria Naylor, by using myself as a protagonist, I was able to have the book act partly as a catharsis.",
        "Basically, what 1996 is about, it's about our loss of privacy in this country, that the government has moved well beyond just the simple following of people, and the tapping of their phones.",
        "But they now have technology that is able to decode the brain patterns, and to detect what people are actually thinking.",
        "And they have another technology called microwave hearing, where they can actually input words into your head, bypassing your ears.",
        "Now, these are both, both of these technologies are documented, and people have patents for part of the process.",
        "So, what I wanted to do in 1996 was to say to my fellow Americans, is that we have to be vigilant about any attacks on our civil liberties, even innocuous attacks, because they can snowball and lead to other things.",
        "Now, we should know the book is centered around an island off of South Carolina, where you go to enjoy there, and write, and tend to a garden.",
        "And then, as the account of the book suggests, your tranquility is ruined.",
        "I realize at one point, that I was being followed, and then I began to see the surveillance that was going past the road on my house.",
        "And so, these cars began to surveil me.",
        "People began to follow me around, and it did, it was very disrupting to think that your privacy was being violated, and for no reason that I could come up with.",
        "Since I'm not, basically, a political writer, I'm a fiction writer, for the most part.",
        "And so, I just didn't, I didn't understand it.",
        "I knew about CoIntel Pro, which is because I'm African-American, and in those years, the FBI did many shameful things to disrupt black nationalist organizations.",
        "But since I wasn't a part of any of that, I thought that I would be immune, basically, from the government having any interest in me.",
        "But let me play devil's advocate, Gloria.",
        "There are going to be people who are going to say, just based on what you just said, why would the government follow you?",
        "What interest would they have?",
        "Etcetera, etcetera.",
        "Here's a woman who's just simply, underline, paranoid.",
        "Well, what I can say to them is this: it's the same thing that happens when a child is abused by a trusted adult.",
        "Now, that child will go to some parents and tell them these things.",
        "They will be believed by some of the parents.",
        "Some of the parents will never believe that Uncle George could be doing these things to their little girl.",
        "So, it's either that you're gonna believe me, or you're not going to believe me, and I couldn't worry about that.",
        "I worried about it a little bit, Ed, to be truthful with you.",
        "Mm-hmm."

        "I think I just ran into the wrong people at the wrong time, and like the book shows, what starts from a very innocent dispute with a neighbor cascades and cascades and cascades into a whole production.",
        "Gloria, let me get your thought when, a couple of weeks ago, you saw the headline, like most of us did, about the White House, and the tapping of American citizens.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "With this book, you must have not been surprised, but I would think you, it caused you to sit straight up.",
        "I was surprised that it even came out.",
        "And like the New York Times themselves admitted, they sat on the story for a whole year.",
        "And that's part of why we don't know the truth of many of these black operations that go on.",
        "And because of one, the patriotism of some people in the news media, because of the improbability that you would be believed if you became a whistle-blower, all of that lets these abuses flourish.",
        "The intelligence community, for the most part, has not accountability at all; to the Congress, to us the American people, and so they feel that they above the law.",
        "And every blue moon, something likes this Times Manifesto will come out, and people will say to themselves, my God, I had no idea that's going on.",
        "What I believe is that a lot more than that is going on.",

        "What has happened?",
        "A few weeks ago the Chihuahua Attorney General, Patricia Gonzalez said that the state had finally identified some suspects in the killing of Mr. Almarez.",
        "But she didn't release much details other than to say that their whereabouts remain unknown.",
        "So actually, you say the attorney general of the state of Chihuahua says that there may be a break in the case.",
        "Before he was killed, Sergio did implicate several people, and of those people, none of those are suspects or officially identified as suspects.",
        "All indications are that they're going after other people who may be tied more to the police department.",
        "But again, all the details have been pretty murky up to this point.",
        "Unfortunately, many of these cases in Cuidad Juarez, whether it's the death of an attorney or the death of more than four hundred women - the murders remain pretty much unsolved, with little hope of justice for the victims.",
        "Well you mention these series of serial murders there in Juarez.",
        "Haven't there been some arrests in those in the last few months?",
        "There was an arrest, a big arrest; that was Edgar Alvarez Cruz, who was arrested on August 15, 2006 by U.S.",
        "Marshal's in Denver.",
        "He's in jail in Juarez being charged with fourteen murders.",
        "But, to this point, a lot of the charges on him do not appear to hold up.",
        "His own background does not suggest a criminal history; even his former wife and, and his employer in Denver has come up with dates that suggest that he was in Denver at the time some of these murders were taking place in Cuidad Juarez.",
        "And I think there were a couple of other suspects also in custody.",
        "But, I gather, real questions about whether or not these people actually have anything to do with these murders.",
        "Exactly.",
        "The case is being based on the man by the name of Jose Francisco Granados, but his credibility is very much in doubt.",
        "Mr. Granados has a long rap sheet in El Paso and New Mexico, and is currently serving time in New Jersey for immigration violations.",
        "But much of the stuff he's been saying about Mr. Alvarez Cruz has, so far, not held up.",
        "So as things stand in Juarez, the murder of the lawyer, Sergio Dante Almarez, a year ago - the man who was defending people who he said were wrongly accused of participating in these mass serial murders down there - he was shot down on the street, and essentially nothing has happened in that case.",
        "I mean you wonder is there any good news to be had out of Juarez?"
