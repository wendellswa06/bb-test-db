        "Right.",
        "The debate really is, what do we do with this?",
        "Do we build these?",
        "Do we build weaponized versions of them?",
        "Do you build them en masse?",
        "Do militaries invest in this and take warfare to a whole new domain, a domain of warfare where humans have less control over what happens on the battlefield?",
        "And these debates are not only happening in the United States and Western democracies.",
        "These debates are happening in autocratic countries, in highly isolated countries, in countries that have violated international norms repeatedly.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, Russia is building a fleet of armed ground robots for war on the plains of Europe.",
        "And Russian generals have talked about a vision in the future of fully roboticized units that are independently conducting operations.",
        "So other countries are leaning hard into this technology.",
        "So if people listening are starting to get worried, let me just assure them it gets worse.",
        "(Laughter).",
        "You describe a lot of terrifying scenarios.",
        "One of them is what you call a flash war, which is sort of like the flash crash that happened in the stock market partially as a result of automated trading.",
        "What is a flash war?",
        "Well, just as we've seen in arms race and speed and stock trading where stock trading now has moved to time speeds in milliseconds where humans cannot possibly be engaged and compete, the fear is that we'd see something similar in warfare where countries automate decisions on the battlefield, taking humans out of the loop because there's an advantage in speed.",
        "But just like we've seen accidents in stock trading where algorithms are interacting in surprising ways and you get things like flash crashes, the worry is that you get an equivalent - a flash war where algorithms interact in some way and the robots start shooting each other and running amok, and then humans are scrambling to put a lid back on it.",
        "You also raise the possibility that autonomous weapons could save lives because machines wouldn't make the same mistakes that people make.",
        "Explain that.",
        "Well, that's certainly one of the arguments against a ban or people even arguing in favor of building these weapons.",
        "And I'd compare them to looking at cars.",
        "Just like self-driving cars could someday make the roads much safer, some people have argued, well, maybe autonomous weapons could be more precise and more humane by avoiding civilian casualties in war and only killing the enemy."

        "You also served in the U.S.",

        "Tell us about one of those instances.",
        "And I wonder what an autonomous weapon would have done had it been in your shoes.",
        "There was an incident early in the wars in Afghanistan where we were up on a mountaintop in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border.",
        "I was part of a ranger sniper team.",
        "And a little girl came along that was scouting out our position.",

        "No one discussed it.",
        "No one - it would have been wrong.",

        "The laws of war do not set an age for combatants.",
        "It's based on your actions.",
        "And if you're scouting for the enemy, you're participating in hostilities.",
        "So an autonomous weapon that was designed to obey the laws of war would have shot this little girl.",
        "So there is an important difference in what is legal and what is right.",
        "And that is one of the concerns that people raise about autonomous weapons, is a lack of ability to feel empathy and to engage in mercy in war.",
        "And that if we build these weapons, they would take away a powerful restraint in warfare that humans have.",
        "So how do we make sure this doesn't happen?",
        "Well, there are a number of people who've called for an international treaty that would ban autonomous weapons.",
        "There have been conversations underway at the United Nations for five years now.",
        "But progress is moving very slowly diplomatically.",
        "Meanwhile, the technology keeps racing forward.",
        "And we've seen Syria violate international treaties.",
        "We've seen North Korea violate international treaties.",
        "Even if there were an international treaty like this, what guarantee would there be that some country wouldn't see that as an opportunity to get ahead of the pack?",
        "Well, that is exactly one of the objections against a treaty.",
        "These treaties only really constrain countries who care about the laws of war in the first place.",
        "And so a treaty that took away powerful weapons from the most law-abiding nations and then only gave them effectively to rogue states would hardly be in anyone's interests.",
        "So I ask this only half in jest - are we doomed?",
        "I mean, I think that's one of the things that the book really wrestles with, is is this inevitable?",
        "Do we control our technology, or does our technology control us?"

        "Maybe a more narrow ban on weapons that target people.",
        "And there has been some discussions underway internationally in trying to frame - reframe the issue and think about, what is the role of humans in warfare?",
