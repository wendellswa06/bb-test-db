        "It was his third run, and he set a track record on that.",
        "It put him from fourth place into second.",
        "And then he just had to wait to see if he would keep that or get bumped to third.",
        "But he didn't, and he kept the silver.",
        "If you remember Erin Hamlin, the flag bearer from Friday night's opening ceremony, she was the first American to win a singles luge medal at all back in 2014.",
        "That was bronze, and this is silver.",

        "That's where they have kind of obstacles at the top of the course and then kind of a big ramp at the bottom to pull tricks on.",
        "And only the best score gets counted, and that's good because Gerard fell down on both of his first runs, leaving him last.",
        "But then on his third try, he pulled it off clean.",
