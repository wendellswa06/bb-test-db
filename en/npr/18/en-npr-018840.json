        "The way Chris Alexander, mayor of Fort Stockton, tells it, it used to be there were so many of those paper-thin, non-biodegradable plastic bags caught up in the region's mesquite bushes, they'd practically become the official flag of Fort Stockton, thousands and thousands every place you looked anywhere you drove, making a racket in the west Texas wind.",
        "In west Texas, we have a lot of bushes that tend to have thorns on them.",
        "And if the bags are out blowing around and they get caught up in these bushes, it's just a horrible sight.",
        "It's - they're just everywhere.",
        "It's been 10 years since Fort Stockton passed its plastic bag ban, and Mayor Alexander says they're pretty happy with the answer.",
        "No more bags blowing in the wind, friend.",
        "But now the state legislature is targeting these local bag bans.",
        "My worry is that our scenery around our roads where most of these bags end up blowing around from will just be decimated.",
        "We'll be back to square one in no time.",
        "State laws revoking local bag and fracking bans are just the start.",
        "The legislature is targeting municipal regulations concerning tree cutting, Airbnb-type rentals, LGBT protections, Uber regulations and, last but certainly not least, laws that constrain local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration authorities.",
        "With the Texas legislature and governor loathe to regulate generally, city governments across the state have begun stepping into the void.",
        "But the Republican leadership in Austin is determined to show Texas cities just who's boss.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Bennett Sandlin is the executive director of the Texas Municipal League, which represents about 1,150 Texas cities and towns.",
        "Sandlin says his membership is alarmed at what they view as a legislative power grab.",
        "So all of a sudden, you've got what I call the Goldilocks version of government.",
        "The federal government's big and bad.",
        "Cities are small and bad.",
        "And somehow the state magically gets it just right.",
        "Texas Governor Greg Abbott is a good example.",
        "As state attorney general, Abbott sued the Obama administration more than 30 times to oppose, quote, \"\"federal overreach.\"\" But now as governor, Abbott is just as focused on resisting Texas' local politicians.",
        "In a speech in Corpus Christi, Abbott urged the state legislature to pass one overarching state law that effectively neuters local laws.",
        "James Quintero is a director at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, the influential conservative think tank in Austin.",
        "Quintero agrees state control should trump local control because city officials are often too liberal.",
        "What you're seeing happening in Texas is we are being Californianized (ph).",
        "What I think conservatives have come to realize within the last several years is that local control is a good policy tool, but it is not the end goal.",
        "The end goal is the preservation and promotion of life, liberty and property rights."
