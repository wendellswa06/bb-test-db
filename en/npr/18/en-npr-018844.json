        "Your book was 2004, The End of Oil, and you write then, Gasoline is two dollars, a barrel of oil is 40, the Middle East is volatile.",
        "That situation is going straight up, right now.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, at the time, you know, I had been talking with intelligence people who that that if oil hit $50 a barrel, that was going to be enough to do two things.",
        "It would be enough to tip the economy into recession, well, the global economy, and it my also be enough to really force the big importing nations to get much more aggressive in being involved in the affairs of these oil producers in the Middle East.",
        "And I think we've learned a couple lessons.",
        "The first is that, you know, our economy can handle higher prices, and the other thing we've learned is that, you know, as prices go up and as our focus on oil intensifies, so does our interest in these oil producing countries.",
        "And I think that it's a recipe for disaster because you can't continue to control supply.",
        "If, for example, we were able to take care of the political chaos in Iraq and begin producing the kinds of oil that we always thought we could, that's great, but almost as sure as rain, instability is going to crop up somewhere else.",
        "Essentially, a supply-focused oil strategy is like a game of Whac-A-Mole.",
        "You know, you smash down, you knock down the instability in one region, it's going to pop up somewhere else, and you will always face that threat.",
        "You will always face that risk as long as your energy strategy has as its focus supply.",
        "Really the only thing America could do and really needs to do is focus on the area of the equation that it can control, and that is demand.",
        "And that's an area that we have really been sadly slow to attack as aggressively as we should have.",
        "And to that end you would argue, I would guess, that high prices kind of support that ethic.",
        "Well, they should.",
        "I mean, again, you know, the classic economic model says that as price goes up, demand goes down and people begin to look for alternatives.",
        "They either become more efficient in how they're using oil or at the same time they begin looking for alternatives.",
        "And we're seeing, we're beginning to see some of that.",
        "We're seeing businesses beginning to make a shift to much more energy-efficient equipment.",
        "And we're seeing a lot of investment in alternative fuels, investment that's been spurred in large part by government promises of tax breaks and the like, you know, subsidies.",
        "So we're seeing - at some level we're seeing high prices having their effect.",
        "But at the consumer level it's as if people are still waiting and seeing.",
        "They know, I think, that in the past price spikes have always been followed by gluts.",
        "High prices tend to encourage oil companies to go out and look for more oil, invest more heavily in exploration technologies, and those usually bear fruit in the form of massive volumes of new oil, which depresses the price.",
        "And I think a lot of American consumers are waiting for that dynamic to take - to kick in.",
        "And so they're not really altering their behavior.",
        "They're not buying a smaller car.",
        "They're not rethinking about where they live in relation to work so they can shorten their commuting time.",
        "And that's the really - I think that's the big factor, the unknown here, is when do American consumers begin taking energy efficiency seriously?",
        "Would you argue then that the discovery of a great reserve under the Gulf of Mexico is not good news?"
