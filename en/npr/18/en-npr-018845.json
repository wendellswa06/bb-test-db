        "What you don't want to have is a situation where you're saying, we're going to have everybody, regardless of their health problems, come in and then have all of the healthy people exit the market because then the average cost of those who remain goes up really high.",

        "Former GOP Senate staffer Rodney Whitlock thinks the Senate bill will have to add something similar.",
        "I believe that the bill that the Senate will vote on, assuming they get to that point, will have some sort of mechanism to cause participation in it.",
        "So why isn't that already in the bill?",
        "Whitlock says McConnell may be worried that it runs afoul of procedural rules that allow Republicans to pass the health care bill with a simple majority vote.",
        "If you are concerned that that might be the case, then, strategically, you may want to wait until the very last second to be presenting the language to the parliamentarian.",
        "Blumberg warns without a strong provision to keep healthy customers in the marketplace, insurance companies will be tempted to offer more stripped-down policies.",
        "And that could leave the individual market in worse shape than before Obamacare.",

        "But historically, the United States government has played a very active role in making sure that the kind of management that the domain name system had was consistent with certain values the United States government thought important.",
        "So there was a very famous incident where one of the real heroes in the history of the Internet, a man named Jon Postel, who died just about the time ICANN was formed, tried to exercise some control over the way domain names would be executed.",
        "And the federal government basically threatened that unless he fell back into line and let ICANN do its work, they would withdraw any support to his university and to him personally.",
        "So the United States government has not been a passive player in this, but they've also not been a kind of ongoing manager in command and control over what happens.",
        "They've tried to get this private company to run it in ways that makes people at least satisfied.",
        "But why are some countries unhappy with the status quo?",

        "Well, I think the real thing to recognize here is a lot of countries are just upset with the United States, and this is a way to express that frustration.",
        "So I wouldn't actually think that if it weren't for the other things going on in the world, any of these countries would've taken this opportunity to attack the structure of ICANN.",
        "I personally have been a critic of ICANN, but I think right now it would be a mistake to displace them.",
        "There've been many policy decisions they've made that I think are a mistake, but I think there's a real fear that an instability from that shift would be quite damaging.",
        "But countries like Iran and China and many European countries believe that the process that ICANN has produced for making their policy decisions has not been sufficiently attentive to government interest and they'd, therefore, like to see a much stronger role from governments in controlling how the organization hands out what they believe to be this extremely important resource that, again, which I think many people think might turn out to be not so important at all.",
        "So is this something that we need to be caring about, or why should we care about this in general?",
        "Well, the issue of Internet governance in general is something we should be deeply concerned about, because there are many countries--and China is the leader in this with respect to censorship of free speech, and the United States is the leader in this with respect to regulation of intellectual property, but there are many governments that are attempting to exercise very strong influence over the Internet and the way the Internet functions.",
        "That influence is, in fact, best exercised not by controlling domain names, but just by regulating how the Internet service providers within their countries provide access to the Internet.",
        "But the nature of the Internet as a place that encourages free exchange of ideas and free speech is continually threatened by governments who don't share those values.",
        "So I think that's something we need to be fundamentally concerned about.",
        "And ICANN could potentially play a role for the good or role for the bad in that ultimate question.",
        "And I think that they have matured into an organization that's trying to keep a very narrow footprint on what the ultimate policy decisions are that control the Internet.",
        "But potentially if ICANN's displaced by another organization, a government structural organization, you could begin to see that organization trying to become another regulator of behavior on the Internet.",
        "And...",
        "Well, the European Union is pushing for a UN role in Internet governance.",
        "Is that a good idea?",
        "What are the problems with that idea?",
        "Well, you know, I find it's hard in principle to oppose the idea of a UN role.",
        "I think the resistance I feel about it--and others, too--is just the practical reality of what that would mean.",
        "And the concern is that whereas ICANN has now committed itself to a relatively narrow policy role, where what it thinks its job is is just to make sure that the domain name system functions smoothly and efficiently and competitively.",
        "The concern is that if the UN became more of a participant in this, they would want to use this as an opportunity to exercise lots of control over how behavior happened in the Internet.",
        "Now I think, you know, in principle, we ought to be open to the idea of lots of governments participating in deciding what the Internet should be.",
        "So from that theoretical perspective, it sounds fine.",
        "It's the practical concern of what would actually happen if such an agency got created that I think makes lots of people very afraid.",

        "And so long as there's not powerful search engines out there as a backup, that organization does exercise significant power.",
        "But I think that what we're seeing is as the Internet matures, the actual power that the domain name has over anything is much less than anybody thought even just five years ago.",
        "So in the long run, it might turn out that this is not a huge problem at all.",
        "So immediately, what are the--I mean, can the--whoever's bothered by ICANN's absolute control over this, what specific argument do they bring?",
        "Well, what they're concerned about is that ICANN is not being sufficiently responsive to people who are making demands for other top-level domains.",
        "That's, like, dot-C-O-M, dot-com or dot-edu.",
        "They're not being sufficiently responsive to make sure that, you know, there's a diversity up there, that all these domain names aren't primarily in English, for example, or the top TLDs are not in English.",
        "So they're just anxious that the organization has not responded to the particular demands that these people are making.",
        "And in principle, I think what ICANN could do could turn out to be very damaging, depending on how they develop their policies.",
        "So if they made it very simple for people to take over domain names so that, you know, again, IBM lost control of their domain name too easily, that would be very bad.",
        "But the real danger, I think, that, you know, we should be worrying about is not so much whether ICANN is the best structure in the world, but what would the alternative look like and would those alternatives actually bring more trouble to the table than they would be worth.",
