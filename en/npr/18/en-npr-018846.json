        "Well, basically, ICANN is not directly in the business of handing out the domain names.",
        "What they do is they decide what the TLDs are going to be.",
        "So, for example, dot-edu is one of the original seven top-level domains.",
        "And there are lots of country code domain names, so dot-US is the country code domain name.",
        "But then there are registrars, and there's lots of these registrars now in competition, that are in the business of actually selling the domain names.",
        "So, for example, VeriSign is a registrar.",
        "You go to their Web site and you can buy a domain name now very cheaply.",
        "And what that company does is then coordinate to make sure that only one domain name like that is sold.",
        "And when that is sold, then you own that domain name for as long as you pay the bills.",
        "So the actual domain names get allocated in that way.",
        "Now if you come to VeriSign and you say, `I want to buy IBM.com,' and it turns out IBM is not actually owned at that minute--I guarantee it is--but if it turned out like that, then there might be issues about trademark that these registrars would be concerned about.",
        "And, in fact, one of the rules ICANN has imposed is that all of these registrars within the system actually exercise a similar process for dealing with trademark complaints.",
        "So whenever a famous company is concerned somebody is taking a domain name that is inconsistent with their trademark, then there's a procedure for actually arbitrating or deciding who actually should own the domain name.",
        "All right, Brian...",
        "Sorry.",
        "I just wanted to say, Brian, thanks so much for calling.",
        "And I want to remind our listeners that you are listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Lawrence Lessig, I just wanted to move on to another question, and that is that in August, the Commerce Department blocked the creation of a domain for pornography, and that came after opposition from some conservatives and religious organizations.",
        "So is that a case where there's a question of US political inference, possibly the US being involved in censoring the Internet for political reasons?",
        "Well, I think that is a big concern.",
        "And I think what happens from the perspective of the rest of the world is when the United States says all they're interested in doing is setting up an efficient system for allocating domain names, it begins to seem a little bit inconsistent when the government actually exercises some influence to direct the organization in the particular way they've set up domain name.",
        "I think ICANN itself must feel the practical reality that they've got to keep the Commerce Department happy, and the Commerce Department is, of course, a political agency within a very political government.",
        "So there's no way that political influences won't have an effect.",
        "And so, you know, again, I, at the very beginning of ICANN, was a strong critic of ICANN because I was concerned about exactly this relationship, that the US government would try to exercise control in a way that would be ultimately harmful for the Internet.",
        "And, you know, if we lived in a world where we could get the best of all possible systems, it wouldn't be ICANN.",
        "But the concern is just what replaces it and what values does that entity embrace.",
        "So..."

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Eric in Philadelphia, go ahead.",
        "Eric?",
        "Yes.",
        "I was wondering if I could hear a couple of specific examples in which countries have complained about not getting decent response from ICANN.",
        "What were some specific examples?",
        "And actually, I have one more question.",
        "That is, if Internet Protocol 6 becomes the major protocol, which I understand expands the number of IP addresses, how important is this going to be in terms of domain control?",
        "Thank you.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks for your questions.",
        "I'll take my answers off the air.",
        "And maybe you can also explain for us what Internet Protocol 6 is.",
        "Sure.",
        "The big sorts of frustration that most countries have",
        "Now that IPv6, Internet Protocol 6, is just a much larger addressing system for that heart of the domain system called the Internet Protocol address.",
        "So every computer is referred to on the Internet not by a name really but by an IP address.",
        "And right now that IP is relatively short, and IPv6 would make it so long that basically every single atom in the universe could be--or in our planet could be marked with an IP address and we'd still be able to find it all.",
        "So if we push to that, that doesn't directly affect how the domain name system could function.",
        "You'd still have the need to decide how you're going to allocate domain names.",
        "But what it will do is facilitate lots of other potential regulation by government.",
        "So, for example, governments that want to use the Internet to enforce intellectual property rules or governments that want to use the Internet to better protect privacy or better protect or interfere with free speech, all of these become more possibly regulated with IPv6 just because the system will build in authentication, or could, for individuals, and so it's easier to track down who individuals are who are using the Internet and, therefore, control what, in fact, they do on the Internet.",
        "So that could be a substantial change, but it's somewhat removed from what ICANN is doing right now.",
        "So, Professor Lessig, this World Summit on the Information Society that is taking place in Tunisia this week, what do you really expect to happen there?",
        "Is anything going to happen about this, or is it just going to be a big argument?",
        "Is it really politics that we're talking about or is something concrete really going to happen there?",
        "I think it's certainly politics, I don't think anything concrete is going to happen, but I still think it'll be very important.",
        "What's going to happen is a lot of organizations and governments, primarily from the south, are organizing to push a message at the World Summit that, quite frankly, the World Summit has not been eager to hear.",
        "And part of that message is about inclusion in the way that the argument about ICANN is and part of the message is really about substantive policy.",
        "So the United States and European governments have been very keen that the World Summit not consider issues about intellectual property.",
        "But many of us and many people in Tunis right now say, `How can you have a World Summit on Information Society without considering what parts of the information world are controlled and what parts are in the public domain?",
        "So..."
