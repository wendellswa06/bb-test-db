        "You know, just the title of your book, \"\"The Republican War on Science,\"\" makes it sound as if the Democrats can do no wrong anywhere.",
        "I don't mean to suggest that the Democrats have never misused science, or that the political left has never misused science.",
        "I think, to some extent, everyone cherry-picks favorable information to support a particular point of view.",
        "And, actually, I think, you know, just to give a Democrat example, I think John Edwards in the 2004 presidential campaign was really out of line when he suggested that if people voted for the Edwards-Kerry ticket that people like Christopher Reeve would get out of their wheelchairs and walk again, because they were pro-stem-cell research.",
        "I mean, that really exaggerates what's known, and scientists cannot promise specific cures on a specific time line.",
        "So that's a misuse of science by a Democrat.",
        "It certainly happens.",
        "But I think we have kind of the perfect storm from the Republican Party right now, because the Bush administration is systematically catering to interest groups that are meddling with science across a wide variety of areas, and the key interest groups, again: religious conservatives and regulated business.",
        "What does it actually mean--when you say, `politicize science,' what do you mean by that?",
        "Well, I mean political attacks on scientific information or on the scientific process.",
        "And, you know...",
        "Give me a good example.",
        "Give me a good example of what you mean by that.",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, one great example--one of the case studies of the political misuse of science under the Bush administration--and this was originally reported by The New York Times, exposed by The New York Times--is that the White House attempted to edit the content of an Environmental Protection Agency report on the environment, and specifically the climate change section.",
        "So political people trying to doctor the scientific information expressed about climate change, and changing it very dramatically so that it no longer reflected the mainstream scientific position, which is that humans are causing global warming right now.",
        "So that is political interference with the scientific process and with scientific information.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "1 (800) 989-8255.",
        "You say that the politicization of science in this administration goes back to August of 2001, when President Bush set the current federal policy on stem cell research.",
        "And we all remember when he went on TV and told Americans that more than 30 genetically diverse embryonic stem cell lines existed.",
        "And you say that counts, in your book, quote, \"\"as one of the most flagrant, purely scientific deceptions ever perpetuated by a US president on an unsuspecting public.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was actually more than 60 that he promised the public, and this turned out to be flat wrong.",
        "And within days, scientists were saying, `Where did he get this more-than-60 number?",
        "And it turns out that it was just an error.",
        "I can't say that the president lied.",
        "Maybe he just made a mistake.",
        "However, he should not have made such a mistake because he has the access to the best scientific advice that he wants.",
        "And this was a relatively simple confusion.",
        "And so I don't think that it's very excusable.",
        "And I would also add that there has been no apology.",
        "And this information was crucial to the policy decision.",
        "There's also been no retraction of the policy, despite the fact that its informational basis has been thoroughly undermined, because it's not allowing nearly as much research to go forward as the president promised, because there aren't nearly as many lines as he promised, and those that are available are genetically limited and contaminated.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So you're not saying that the president cooked the books on this one--I mean, that he said, you know, `Come up with a number for me that's palatable, and I don't care how you do it'?"

        "Well, I don't really know what happened behind the scenes.",
        "I know that the information is wrong, has been clearly shown to be wrong, and that on--the president announcing a policy decision before a national audience shouldn't make this kind of error.",
        "You call this the new war on science that has its roots in the old war, going back to the Gingrich-era Congress in the mid-1990s.",
        "The mantra of that Congress was that policy must rest on, quote, \"\"sound science.\"\" Now that sounds reasonable.",
        "What's the problem with sound science?",
        "Well, `sound science' is, I think, a PR catchphrase that is often used by the political right.",
        "And it sounds like it means `good science,' but I think that when you look at how they use it, it doesn't actually mean that.",
        "It means something more complicated and much more problematic.",
        "It actually means, `Don't take action on the part of government unless there is a very, very high burden of scientific proof that has been satisfied.",
        "And that's very different from just saying, `good science,' because sometimes government has to take action even in the face of inadequate information, because sometimes inaction itself has consequences.",
        "And I think that the sound science movement is essentially saying, `Don't do that.",
        "But you have to look carefully at how they're using sound science and what kinds of policies it's being used to support.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "1 (800) 989-8255 is our number.",
        "I guess the best example of sound science might be the political debate over climate change, where--you talk about that a lot in your book.",
        "Certainly.",
        "Well, this is one of the key politicized scientific issues of our time, although now evolution is really giving it a run for the money.",
        "But, you know, climate change is an issue where a number of Republicans and the administration have consistently, unfortunately, sought to undermine, in various strategic ways, the scientific consensus view, which is that humans are causing greenhouse warming, and that this is happening now.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You also say that the president and the White House has allies in Congress who are very willing to distort science.",
        "Oh, definitely.",
        "You know, it depends on what area you decide to choose.",
        "Senator Santorum, for example, from Pennsylvania has been a big ally of some of the anti-evolutionist activities that have been going on.",
        "Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma, who's running the Environment and Public Works Committee, has been a big global-warming skeptic and actually went so far as to suggest that the whole global warming thing might be a, quote, \"\"hoax.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "1 (800) 989-8255.",
        "Let's go to the phones.",

        "Hi, Ethan.",
        "Hi.",
        "It's nice to be on the air.",
        "And I just wanted to say, you know, when--you know, Bush was very popular with the Catholic right-wing community, partly because they wanted a president who would put prayer back in school, get rid of the evolution theory and such other things.",
        "Now, basically, he's done nothing good to show, and he's gotten us into a pointless war and, you know, now they're eating their words.",

        "Sure.",
        "I lay part of the blame--only part.",
        "Part of the blame for this problem I think does lie with the media because the media gets taken in all too frequently by politicizing of scientific views and strategies.",
        "And we mentioned this a little bit before, but essentially they're often strategic attempts to create the semblance of scientific debate where it doesn't actually exist, such as evolution or climate change.",

        "Well, increasingly, what you find--and I certainly talked to some of them--is that there are a lot of whistle-blowers and disgruntled scientists and experts leaving various government agencies because they are fed up with the way, essentially, political people are either changing science or looking over their shoulder and so forth.",
        "It seems to be a governmentwide problem.",
        "We have it at a wide variety of agencies.",
        "So one of the most recent ones is Susan Wood, an expert on women's health drugs, left the FDA, sort of saying that what was done on the issue of Plan B emergency contraception was out of line.",
        "Before that, we had Rick Piltz, and he left the Climate Change Science Program, saying that the White House was politically editing the science documents.",
        "So--and, you know, then you can talk about other examples and other agencies, but it seems to be a governmentwide problem, where political people are messing with the science.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You also talk about the beginnings of something you call in Congress the `science court' approach.",
        "Describe what you mean by that, where scientists are brought before Congress as if the congressional committees are going to be judging whether the research is good or not.",
        "Well, I think this is a very disturbing trend, and it's something we saw a lot of under the Gingrich Congress and that we still see now.",
        "Essentially, it's political theater in which scientists with very different points of view are brought to testify they sort of--each makes their points very loudly, and people watching, including the members of Congress, are like, `Wow, there's a big, you know, debate here.",
        "We're not sure who's right; you know, we're just not going to take any political action.",
        "And, in fact, what you can do is sort of stack the debate so you have a couple of outliers, and then you'll have one person representing what most scientists think to be the case, and it makes it look like there's debate or confusion when, in fact, a mainstream position in the scientific community itself has largely been reached.",
        "This is certainly the case on climate change, where there are some outliers who certainly do believe what they're saying, but the mainstream scientific community has reached a pretty firm consensus conclusion, and certainly a strong enough conclusion to be used to justify policy action.",
        "Talking with Chris Mooney, author of \"\"The Republican War on Science\"\" and he's also Washington correspondent for Seed magazine, on TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "We've seen some of that--the idea of creating a debate or a controversy.",
        "I know in intelligent design the mantra is `Teach the controversy,' where--the controversy about whether, you know, evolution is valid or there are holes on it where scientists would say there is no controversy.",
        "But by even just mouthing those words, you create the illusion there is one.",
        "Right.",
        "They're saying, `Please teach the controversy that we ourselves carefully manufactured.",
        "It's really...",
        "Is that true in other political/science interfaces?",
        "Yeah, I think it's true of a lot of issues.",
        "I mean, you've hit on a very good one, which is--you know, because they actually use the language `Teach the controversy'; that is part of the intelligent design movement's official talking points, because their whole goal is to sow doubt about evolution and sure enough, you know, if journalists cover this as a controversy, then they have effectively won.",
        "But I think that climate change is very similar, where there is again an attempt to undermine, denigrate or raise doubts about what is by now a very strong consensus conclusion--again, humans are causing warming; it's been ratified by the National Academy of Sciences, the American Meteorological Society, the American Geophysical Union--all of the expert bodies in the area.",
        "You write that actually this is a threat, the way that science is being portrayed and treated--politicalization of it--is actually threatening the integrity of American democracy."

        "Exactly.",
        "I believe that that's the case.",
        "And the reason that's so is because in a technologically advanced society like our own, we really rely upon a good strong relationship between democratically elected leaders and the scientific community or people who have scientific expertise because we cannot expect our political leaders to be PhDs themselves, so they really have got to get good quality information, and that information has to inform their decision making on technologically complex issues.",
        "And I think what's often called the politicalization of science is perhaps better understood as a strategic attack on the necessary channels of communication.",
        "Where does the president's science adviser stand in all of this, though?",
        "Shouldn't he be like a sounding board for scientific issues?",
        "Well, you know, the president has a science adviser, Dr. John Marburger.",
        "He's been in place since 2001.",
        "There was some complaint about him getting into place late, but he's been there for a long time now.",
        "Unfortunately, I think that when the nation's leading scientists said there's a problem with the Bush administration and science, as you mentioned, the Union of Concerned Scientists had a number of Nobel laureates and other luminaries of science criticizing the administration very strongly, Dr. Marburger decided that his role was to defend the administration.",
        "But I think that that was unfortunate because the critiques of the scientists--I've looked into them--I think that they are very valid.",
        "And you know, in that position you would hope that Dr. Marburger would agree on the science.",

        "That's the only--that's the scientific definition.",
        "Well, I know, but the fact that it just shows up as greenhouse gases--the oceans are acidifying, the ocean temperatures are change--it's not just, you know, the narrow definition I think that you're bringing into it--at least the evidence is just not the level of carbon dioxide.",
