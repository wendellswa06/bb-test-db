        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "I am Ira Flatow.",
        "We're talking this hour with Chris Mooney, Washington correspondent for Seed magazine and author of \"\"The Republican War on Science,\"\" out this year from Basic Books.",
        "Our number, 1 (800) 989-8255.",
        "You also, Chris--before--we're running out of time, there's so much to talk about.",
        "Let's talk about some of the tactics that you mentioned that are used to discredit good science and have it labeled as junk science.",
        "It's almost like you're saying we're in a 1984 situation where things are backwards.",
        "Definitely.",
        "Well, there's a wide variety of techniques that are used, and one is to label good science junk science.",
        "But there's a number of things going on.",
        "I think that there are, on the one hand, they're attacks on, actually, the results of science--misrepresentations, distortions, exaggerations, selective citation of scientific uncertainty, which is very frequently--you want to undermine a strong scientific view, you say, `Oh, wait.",
        "Well, it's uncertain.",
        "Well, everything is uncertain, but actually we know a lot as well.",
        "And then at the same time, another form of abuse is trying to meddle with the process of science rather than the results, so you get slanting of scientific advisory committees so that they will be politically tilted, and you might get a different result than you would get otherwise, or you get demands for more and more review before the government can take action, and this is essentially using science to achieve paralysis by analysis.",
        "So there's a variety of different techniques used.",
        "I think that the war on science is opportunistic and people will settle on any technique as long as they think it'll be effective in attacking information they don't like.",
        "Well, what is wrong with the scientists that they bring forward?",
        "You never see--well, I shouldn't say `you never' 'cause never is a long time--but people are always bringing, you know, other scientists who just dispute what your facts are.",
        "Well, this is why science is so politicized.",
        "There's always dissent within the scientific community, and this is a good thing.",
        "We want this situation to exist.",
        "But the politicization or the political abuse of science occurs when politicians say, `You know what?",
        "I'm going to appoint myself to choose these couple of outlier scientists and say that they're right and ignore what the entire mainstream scientific community is telling me.",
        "That is not the role of politicians to decide which scientist is right.",
        "Politicians need to listen to good well-established scientific advisory processes, such as those that come from the National Academy of Sciences where a number of experts get together and decide what their best take is on the state of knowledge.",
        "Politicians need to use the best available science, not the science that they cherry-pick out of convenience.",
        "Let's talk about what you say in your book as remedies, things that need to be done.",
        "And one of the things you point out is that we need to reinstate something like the Office of Technology policy that was disbanded.",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, this was one of the landmark moments in what I call the war on science.",
        "The Gingrich Republicans took control of Congress and they promptly got rid of Congress' well-established and world-renown scientific advisory body, the Office of Technology Assessment.",
        "We need to bring it back; Congress is flying blind essentially without science advice, and it shows.",
        "And bringing back something like the Office of Technology Assessment would, I think, partially help to depoliticize science in the sense that you would have a well-established scientific advisory body with a bipartisan board of directors who are members of Congress that would give Congress its assessment of the best state of knowledge, and it would be much harder for members of Congress to go out and listen to a think tank or a lobbyist or an interest group and get a contrary spin on the science because Congress' own science advisers would have given them a statement on whatever topic it is.",
        "What about you point out the need for scientists to speak out more?"

        "Right.",
        "This is something--we're always looking for scientists to tell us what's on their mind.",
        "It's hard to, you know, find them.",
        "They're waking up a little bit, because not only are they extremely outraged about the political misuses of science in the Bush administration, but now they're also outraged about the anti-evolutionist brush fire that is essentially sweeping the nation.",
        "So they're worried about it on the national level and they're worried about it on the local level, and so scientists are really starting to energize.",
        "They need to do more though.",
        "They can sign statements, you know, talking about how the president's administration has misused science.",
        "That's a start.",
        "But signing statements isn't enough.",
        "They have to get involved at the local level in these evolution/creationist fights and they need to stand up for the state of scientific knowledge and they need to explain to the public what they know.",
        "They need to engage because they know a lot of great stuff, but they're losing these battles because it isn't translating.",
        "Their knowledge is not translating to the public.",
        "So scientists have to think about being better communicators; publishing great papers is not going to be enough anymore.",
        "But you also need more than just them being great communicators.",
        "You need the media to understand the--and be able to understand the fine points of policy--Don't you?--and fine points of the science when people are trying to come up with different points of view.",
        "Now there are issues where scientific debate does exist, and in that case journalists should cover it in a 50-50 kind of fashion.",
        "You know, one side, it says this, one side it says the other.",
        "But they shouldn't be involved in constructing a phony he said/she said debate because that misleads the public about the state of scientific knowledge and that's not a journalist's responsibility.",
        "What do you think of Michael Creighton's efforts to discredit climate change through a critique basically disguised as a novel?",
        "Well, you know, what I'd like to say about Creighton is that since he wrote a novel, you know, I could write a novel in which smoking didn't cause lung cancer because in the world of novel writing, you are god.",
        "You control the laws of the universe, but I don't think my writing such a novel would be a very helpful contribution to political discussion, and that's basically my take on his contrarian book about climate science.",

        "I originally came in on evolution, but global warming is just as good because I think it presents the same types of problem, and I see the problem is we aren't properly educating students.",
        "You know, religion teaches stuff as fact, and unfortunately in science classes we do the same thing.",
        "I mean, science is a process, and you go through stuff.",
        "So I mean, you know, we believe in evolutionary theory because there is absolutely nothing else that will fit, so if you're talking about going through ideas--providing the ideas that would make sense if we taught how science is done right and why we accept certain theories as being the best we have.",
        "And the reason I'm stressing the best we have is because, for instance, Newtonian mechanics and quantum theories are very exact.",
        "String theory is highly speculative.",
        "Evolution and global warming are somewhere in the middle, yet they're all lumped together as theories and so people naturally come along and say, `Hey, well, it's just a theory.",

        "You know, but you know, the media have a lot to do with it.",
        "You know, for instance, since we're talking about global warming, on the issue of global warming as far as I can tell there's a very short, concise, scientific definition.",

        "There's all sorts of things to indicate climate change.",
        "But there isn't a whole lot of evidence to show even though we're dumping tons of, you know, greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that the atmosphere is warming at all.",

        "Now they until, I think, last May were who Nature used to vet the science on it.",
        "So I mean, you know, unless scientists are using different definitions, which never gets to the public, that's part of what's causing the confusion.",
        "Chris?",
        "Well, I was agreeing with the caller throughout most of it until we got on to the details of climate change.",
        "And the reason that we say that humans are causing climate change is because scientists cannot explain what we're seeing just by invoking natural causes.",
        "They need to overlay on top of that the human greenhouse warming effect, and then they're able to find models matching observations, and they find that they have a very good, strong explanation.",
        "The caller mentioned the Christy work, which is not on the whole atmosphere; I believe it's on the troposphere.",
        "It's on the lower atmosphere.",
        "Oh, OK.",
        "I'm not sure if that's right or not, but you know, this work has been challenged but actually very recently.",
        "Yeah.",

        "I think we're teaching science the same way people teach religion, that it's truth.",

        "You have to admit that the overwhelming number of scientists believe that global warming is happening.",
        "And I think global warming is happening.",

        "I mean, this was a great--and some would even say heroic era when science was used essentially to win the war, raid out a bomb and so forth, and then the science was wielded in peacetime to help advance society and, you know, it fed into the space program and put a man on the moon and all these good, wonderful things that we see as great American achievements, even if maybe the bomb was not the greatest of achievements.",
