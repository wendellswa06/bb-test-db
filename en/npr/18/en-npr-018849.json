        "I wrote to Mount Holyoke College, and of this May I received a $500 grant from them that I put toward starting, really, Camp Eureka.",
        "And I then started a fundraising letter campaign, which I sent out to an array of local organizations and national organizations, and received a very favorable response from in-store donations to monetary donations, including an anonymous donor who even covered all of the bus costs, for picking up the children every morning to dropping them off, to paying for their field trips.",
        "And as everyone knows, with the cost of fuel today, that was quite pricey.",

        "Jim Baker, the insider - Ronald Reagan was smart enough to know he needed an insider.",
        "Baker told him that's the third rail of American politics.",
        "You touch it, you get electrocuted.",
        "As a result, Reagan changed course, and he pursued the economy with laser-like focus and pursued tax reform instead.",
        "There was also a question of whether members of the Cabinet, Secretary Baker, would be given polygraph tests to see if they were leaking.",
        "You were confronted with that problem.",
        "Well, yeah, that was a rather aberrant event.",
        "We had a National Security Council meeting one time from which emanated a rather destructive leak.",
        "And the president went along with the recommendation of his national security adviser to require the people at the meeting to take lie detector tests.",
        "Well, when I learned of it, I walked in the Oval Office, and he was - President Reagan was having lunch with Vice President Bush and Secretary of State George Shultz.",
        "And I said, Mr. President, here's what's happened, and here's why this doesn't work.",
        "And as soon as I outlined what had happened, George Shultz said, well, Mr. President, if you want me to take a lie detector test, I'll take it, but it will be the last thing I do as your secretary of state.",
        "So the president recognized that this was a terrible error, and he reversed it.",
