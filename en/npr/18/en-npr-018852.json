        "Well, hard to say exactly how long the US forces will stay there, but it is a time that we can say that the configuration and the numbers of US forces will change, that the numbers over time--meaning in the coming year--will begin to decline, and the role and mission will change; we'll do less of combat, more in support of Iraqi forces and more in the area of training of Iraqi forces.",
        "But for the immediate future, the focus of our forces, together with the Iraqis, will be to go after particularly the foreign fighters and those who support the return of the Saddamist regime, but fundamentally, the focus of the operation will be against the foreign fighters.",

        "Let's talk about the new draft constitution, which is to be voted on next month.",
        "You've written that it should be judged on two standards.",
        "The first, its commitment to human rights and democracy; the second on its ability to unite the country.",
        "And you say it succeeds on the first count.",
        "Why, first of all?",
        "Well, because it has a extremely good set of rights that it grants or guarantees to the population of Iraq.",
        "It organizes the government in a way that provides for checks and balances.",
        "It does work in terms of a federal structure that brings the Kurds back into Iraq.",
        "As you know, the Kurds have not been a de facto part of Iraq since Saddam's invasion of Kuwait; they were outside Iraqi control and were protected by the coalition through a no-fly zone.",
        "And it also deals appropriately with concerns having to do with resources such as oil and gas so that the central government will have a significant role in making sure that those resources are used fairly across the nation.",
        "It also states that there has to be a new strategy for how resources, such as oil and gas, are developed.",
        "I think in terms of the fundamentals, it's a good document.",
        "It's a compromise, a synthesis, as I have called it, between the traditional Iraqi values and Islam, but also the universal values of--on principles of democracy and human rights.",
        "Now Islam in this document is not the sole source of legislation, but I think--I don't think the language is--it's a fundamental source of legislation.",
        "It is...",
        "And...",
        "It is a principal source, and it says no laws can be against the fundamentals of Islam, but at the same time, it says no law can be established in Iraq in violation of the principles of democracy, and it also says that no law can be enacted in violation of the human rights.",
        "So it has three principles that document that laws cannot violate democracy and human rights--have been brought to the same level of importance as Islam in terms of the constitution.",
        "So you think the protections are there against Islamic law becoming the sole law of the land?"

        "What about the second count that you said that this must be judged on; that is, its ability to unite the country?",
        "How can this document be a means for unifying the country when so many Sunnis are opposed to it?",
        "Well, that is an important issue and, as I said in the piece, the jury's out on that.",
        "We will have to see how the referendum turns out.",
        "The Sunnis who were there participating in the process, they were not elected.",
        "The responsibility for drafting the constitution was with the Assembly, and the Sunnis had boycotted the election before some Sunnis were identified by the international community and were added.",

        "Many of those issues were adequately dealt with.",

        "Some edits are taking place.",

        "The vice president, Mr. Yawer, has spoken in favor of the document.",
        "The speaker, who's a Sunni, has spoken in favor of the document.",

        "You know, you stick your neck out just by saying you want to be a leader and you will take responsibility.",
        "The second part to that is it seems like there's a lot of foreign fighters trying to destroy your country.",
        "And I don't understand.",
        "It doesn't seem like it's any of their business, you know.",

        "He is still--the ambassador--the leadership in Iraq is taking great risk just for sticking their necks out.",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, of course, you raise a very important point, particularly with regard to the Sunnis, in whose area the insurgency is very active, and many Sunni leaders privately tell me they like the constitution, but publicly, they have been reluctant to embrace it because of that fear.",
        "And in order to defeat the insurgency, we need to win over the people away from the insurgency.",
        "Part of it is the constitution.",
        "Part of it is the election, and I am very encouraged by the registration of voters in the Sunni areas, which shows that people are turning to politics.",

        "But the Sunnis have to see that they are part of the future and have encouraged the Shiites and the Kurds to be open to their concerns--meaning the concerns of the Sunnis, to give them a role so that they can see themselves in this new picture of Iraq that is emerging.",
        "But the issue of terrorism coming from abroad is very important.",
        "They are mostly coming from Syria, and our patience is running out with Syria.",

        "But also, the struggle in Iraq is not only for Iraq, but it's also part of the broader region, the Middle East, the struggle for the region, and that region obviously is vital to the world.",
        "And everyone knows the outcome of the struggle in Iraq will affect the shape of the Middle East and, therefore, people who are opposed to the reform and democratization of the region, they are sending people to Iraq in order to make it difficult for this project of an Iraq that is unified, that's democratic, that is prosperous, that's allied to the responsible nations of the world against extremism and terror, that this project does not succeed or it becomes very difficult for it to succeed."

        "And therefore, I agree strongly that success in Iraq is important for all of us, for the people in the United States, but also for people around the world, and failure there will have a very dramatic, very substantial negative consequences for our security and for security of people around the world.",
