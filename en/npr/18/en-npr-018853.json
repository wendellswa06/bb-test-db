        "And, Dan, this all began with Monsanto creating the new soybean that is resistant to a weed-killer chemical and - what's it called?",
        "Well, the chemical's called dicamba.",

        "Farmers have had a really successful strategy, crops that have been genetically modified to tolerate the weed killer Roundup.",

        "The weeds would die.",
        "Problem is Roundup is not working so well anymore.",
        "Some weeds have now evolved resistance to it, especially one really awful weed called pigweed.",

        "But even though the EPA hasn't approved the use of dicamba on this new seed, obviously, Monsanto has started selling these dicamba-resistant seeds.",
        "That's right.",
        "And that's the really controversial thing about this.",
        "Monsanto says it put those seeds out on the market because farmers wanted the newest varieties for other reasons, too, because they - the seeds offered higher yields.",
        "But Monsanto by doing that was giving farmers a weed-killing tool that farmers could not legally use, at least not yet.",
        "It was telling farmers, here are these dicamba-resistant soybeans, but don't you dare go out and buy dicamba to spray on those crops.",
        "Well, evidently, farmers did exactly that.",
        "They sprayed dicamba illegally, maybe because they were having such, you know, terrible problems with weeds.",
        "But dicamba is a chemical that really blows easily in the wind.",
        "And it is really toxic to regular old soybeans.",
        "So there are now tens of thousands of acres of soybeans in Arkansas and Missouri and Tennessee that are damaged.",
        "And this mustn't be great for relations between farmers there.",
        "It's really bad.",
        "You know, farmers have dealt with pesticide drift before.",
        "But this is so widespread that a lot of people are quite angry, mostly at their neighbors but also at Monsanto for putting this seed out there on the market.",
        "So what happens next?",
        "Well, some farmers have filed formal complaints.",
        "Some of the farmers that have sprayed dicamba probably will be fined.",
        "At some point, the EPA probably will approve Monsanto's new formulation of dicamba, which is supposed to really cut down on the danger of the chemical hurting surrounding fields."
