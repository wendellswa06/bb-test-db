        "Well, it's good to talk do you, Dr. Nissen.",
        "Yeah, that's exactly right.",
        "The key idea is that the memory is not a single faculty of the mind and the memory is composed of several different systems that are supported by different brain systems.",
        "And the kind of memory that we ordinarily mean when we use the term `memory,' we call declarative memory or conscious memory, and that's dependent on the activity and the function of one part of the brain.",
        "But this other kind of memory, unconscious memory, non-declarative memory, is acquired more automatically, more in a trial-and-error kind of way, as a habit, and that depends on a different part of the brain.",
        "So when you asked these patients, `How did you know which one to pick?,' what did they say?",
        "Well, some of them are pretty surprised that they are doing it.",
        "At one moment during the late part of the testing, one of the patients said in the middle of testing.",
        "`How am I doing this?",
        "And the--our co-author, Jennifer Frascino, asked him, `Well, are you doing it because you remember from the past which object was correct and which object was incorrect?",
        "And he said, `No, it just goes from here,' pointing to his head, `from there,' pointing to the table.",
        "Wow.",
        "So are there--I mean, that was the other question I had.",
        "Are there--I mean, do we--is there learning that normally takes place in this habit way or is this something that, you know--that is the way animals learn, for example?",
        "Yeah, well, this is really the motivation for the study in the first place, because we've known for some time that experimental animals, rodents and monkeys being the animals most often studied, have this ability to learn gradually over hundreds of trials by trial and error in a way that depends on this part of the brain that we've called habit learning, the part of the brain called the basal ganglia that's impaired in Parkinson patients.",
        "So we've known for a long time that experimental animals can learn this way, but in the case of humans, we've never been sure whether they have this ability or whether we just do everything by memorization.",
        "You know, we--it's possible that this habit system in humans is rather diminished or overwhelmed by the tendency to memorize everything.",
        "So the question was: If we have that system, we should be able to employ it in the way that monkeys do.",
        "And, indeed, when these subjects learned the task, they learned it in about the number of trials that a monkey would take to do it, several hundred trials, about a thousand trials.",
        "So is this--I mean, this is fascinating, because it sounds like you're sort of getting at the brain structural differences between monkeys and human beings.",
        "Yeah, well, that's exactly right.",
        "It tells us that we do have this robust system for learning habits.",
        "It's going on all the time in us, but it's behind the scenes, so to speak, behind our conscious memory.",
        "We're responding all the time to the contingencies in the environment, to the rewards and punishments that we encounter.",
        "And gradually, our behavior changes, but we're not necessarily conscious of it.",
        "In fact, as we approach the world with our habits and our dispositions and our preferences, one might not be sure whether what one is doing is based on the way we always were or whether it actually is based on training and on having--the fact that we've responded to the rewards and punishments gradually given to us over the years.",
        "Is this--I'm just--now I'm just curious.",
        "Does this have any implications for how to help patients with this kind of strange memory loss in terms of coping with their circumstances?",
        "Well, in one sense it's limited, because the patients don't have the conscious knowledge that they have any information, so--but it does tell us that they have this ability to learn, through repetition, sequential acts, things that they have a chance to do a lot of the time.",
        "And in the case of the patients that we study, it really came like a lightning bolt and it explained to us how they can do as much as they do do in their daily life.",
        "One of the patients takes a little L-shaped walk around his house every day and never gets lost, and they find their way around their house all right, even though they've moved to the house after they developed their memory impairment and live with their families."

        "It often attacks the frontal lobes of the brain.",
        "It attacks different parts of the brain.",
        "But in these particular cases, the virus destroyed parts of the brain important for conscious memory.",
        "And those parts of the brain lie in the inner surface of the temporal lobes involving areas called the hippocampus and some adjacent structures that are anatomically related to the hippocampus.",
        "So tho--that's the system that's important for conscious memory and that's the system that was nearly completely destroyed in these two patients by the virus.",
        "The habit-learning system, on the other hand, depends on a completely different part of the brain called the basal ganglia that includes the caudate nucleus and other structures.",
        "And these structures are well known in medicine because they are the structures that are damaged in patients with Parkinson's disease.",
        "Parts of that system are damaged in Parkinson's disease.",
        "Is it...",
        "Does that answer--go ahead, Anthony.",
        "Yeah, is it believed that these two--I guess two systems are completely separate?",
        "As far as we can see, they're pretty independent of each other.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Yeah.",
        "You know, that's very interesting.",
        "And, in fact, one of the features of habit learning is that it tends to be rigidly organized and is best expressed through the same response systems, in this case through the same, you know, hands and fingers that one used to acquire the information in the first place.",
        "And I might just mention that in this study one of the extraordinary things that we found was that when we took these eight pairs of objects involving all 16 objects, put them on on a pile in the middle of the table, we asked the subjects, `Now you've been doing this for a long time.",
        "Some of these objects have been called correct and some of them have been called incorrect.",
        "We'd like you to sort the objects into the two piles, a correct and an incorrect pile.'",
        "Well, for our healthy subjects, that was just a trivial exercise because they had memorized the answers and then they could do it one way or they could do it another way.",
        "But the patients that had acquired the task through habit learning completely collapsed their performance when they were asked to do this.",
        "They actually performed no better than a flip of a coin in sorting the objects.",
        "And then when the task was reconstituted in its normal way, they shot back up to 90 to 100 percent correct.",
        "So the way that we understand the habit system is--very much, you know, coincides with how you're describing your experience in music, that these things we learn as habits are very specialized, they're rather inflexible and they're best expressed when you do it exactly the same way you learned it.",
