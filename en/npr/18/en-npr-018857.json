        "You know, I had an experience similar to John's.",
        "I had a locker in high school, and if you asked me, I couldn't tell you what the combination was for the lock on the locker--it was one of those spin, you know, numbers on it.",
        "But I walked up to the locker and I spinned the numbers, and it opened.",
        "And my fingers knew how to open the lock, but my brain--I couldn't tell you what the numbers were.",
        "Very--I guess that's something similar.",
        "What would happen--you mentioned the sorting part of the experiment.",
        "What would happen if you, you know, adjusted the conditions or changed things slightly?",
        "Could these amnesiac subjects adapt to that, or did it have to be exactly the same each time for them to learn it?",
        "When we come back, something perhaps even more mysterious than the workings of the brain--religion and science.",

        "Yeah.",
        "It didn't have to be exactly the same every way.",
        "The core thing that they had learned was when they look at a pair of objections, they had a positive feeling about one of them and a less positive feeling about the other one.",
        "So when we asked them, for example, to verbalize their answer rather than reach for the object to make their choice, they had no difficulty doing that because they were essentially expressing the same choice.",
        "And so there are some minor things that one could do like that, but when one changes the whole way the information is being accessed by putting it in a pile, for example, that's when they really did have trouble.",
        "OK.",

        "Well, Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition that begins with memory problems of the conscious type.",
        "The disease begins in the part of the brain that is damaged in these patients we've been studying.",
        "So the first signs of Alzheimer's disease are forgetfulness and losses of conscious memory.",
        "But as the disease progresses, the disease progresses into the cerebral cortex, more widely into the association cortexes, and ultimately both the habit system and the conscious memory system are going to be affected.",
        "So in the end, you know, one doesn't see the distinctions in patients like that because all of the systems are taken over by the disease.",
        "We're talking with Professor Larry Squire of the University of California School of Medicine in San Diego.",
        "And we're talking about a very interesting paper in this current issue of Nature magazine about different kinds of memory systems that we may share with monkeys.",

        "And over a period of time, he began to understand that there was something wrong with his father, but he didn't know exactly what it was.",
        "And the person who was conducting the study--or I guess several people were conducting the study on H.M.--they thought that he was gaining an emotional attachment or he had an emotional understanding for memory that there was something wrong with his father.",
        "Is it possible that these individuals that were in this experiment also are gaining an emotional attachment or an emotional memory of this particular task that they are trying to complete?",
        "Interesting.",
        "Larry Squire?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's an interesting question.",
        "I think that, you know, the way we understand it is that primarily the basis for the learning was an attachment of mild positive and negative feeling, if you will, about the two objects.",
        "But emotion might be too strong of a word to describe it because in these patients, the area of the brain important for emotional learning, the amygdala, is also damaged.",
        "So one doesn't, I think, think of this past performance in terms of having strong emotional attachments or negative repulsions from one object to another, but rather something more subtle if you will: just the changing of response strength and the changing of the valance, the changing of disposition towards one object and another through trial and error and through feedback over hundreds of trials.",
        "Matthew, thanks very much for that call.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "So let me just ask you as we--we're coming to the end of this segment, Larry Squire, but I'm just wondering: How far along are we in understanding human memory?",
        "How far does this particular insight take that?",
        "Well, memory is a large, large topic in neuroscience, and in neuroscience as a whole we're in the early days of the discipline, of course.",
        "It's only the middle of the last century that we really began to study the brain in earnest with modern biological techniques.",
        "But memory is an especially promising avenue for discovery because not only are we studying at the level that we're talking about today--at the level of brain systems, at the level of taxonomy, at the level of understanding how different kinds of memory systems operate and what brain systems support them--but we're also learning a lot at the molecular and genetic level about what happens in the brain exactly between neurons when memories take place.",
        "What does experience do to nerve cells?",
        "It strengthens them.",
        "And this can be studied in very simple animals, in vertebrate animals because of the universality of molecular biology.",
        "So we're beginning to learn a lot both at the systems level and we're learning a lot about how synapses can change, which is the fundamental piece of machinery that happens, that changes when we acquire new experiences."

        "This was supposed to be a week of celebration for NASA, a return to flight for the shuttles after a two-and-a-half-year delay.",
        "But cameras watching the Tuesday launch saw something they didn't want to see: a chunk of debris, most likely foam insulation, flaking off from the shuttle's external fuel tank.",
        "It's the kind of flaw thought to be responsible for the damage that led to the Columbia disaster.",
        "This time, at least, the foam debris didn't appear to strike the shuttle, so NASA engineers don't think Discovery is threatened, but they have grounded the shuttle fleet again as engineers look for a solution to a problem they thought they had under control.",

        "So, Frank Morring, I gather that there's even possibly been more chunks of foam debris, they think, than the original one that seemed to have come off now they've reanalyzed some of the pictures of liftoff.",
        "That's right.",
        "They have a few more that they've seen that are bigger than the allowable size they had planned for.",
        "But the one that they're really worried about is the one that weighed almost a pound that came off an area that they had decided not to work on because they thought they understood what was keeping the foam stuck to the tank there."

        "So this is a different place than the foam that broke off that actually wound up punching a hole in the wing in Columbia and caused that to burn up on entry.",
        "That's right, but it's the same kind of foam.",
        "The foam that brought down Columbia and the foam that they saw on launch this week were both hand-applied foam ramps designed to protect structure from the aerodynamic pressures that the tank encounters during the ascent, which gets pretty fast.",
        "I see.",
        "So by ramp--I mean, I was trying to picture this.",
        "It's not something that you walk up, obviously, but it's a raised slope to cover a bunch of cables, I think, or at least tubing that carry--carries liquid--or maybe it is cables.",

        "But clearly, they have not.",
        "What more can they do?",
        "Well, actually, we just had a conversation with Richard Covey, the astronaut that was appointed to kind of look over NASA's shoulder as they prepared to return to flight.",
        "And basically, they didn't understand what happened.",
        "They thought that the foam came off because of voids, small spaces, inside the hand-applied areas that allowed gas and liquid to expand as the flight continued and literally popped pieces of foam off.",
        "They're pretty sure that's what happened to Columbia.",
        "In this case, they had X-rayed this area.",
        "They didn't see any voids and the foam still came off.",

        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "And, you know, there's been a suggestion that if you look you'll find.",
        "I mean, they've been watching this from all kinds of spectacular angles, including a camera mounted on the external fuel tank.",
        "Some have suggested that this, you know, foam may have popped off before and just nobody ever saw it because the external fuel tank burns up on re-entry.",
        "That's right.",
        "They--in fact, this piece of foam coming off was actually seen with that camera you just mentioned.",
        "They have a lot more data than they've ever had on the condition of the shuttle after it reaches space, and they've seen a lot more.",
        "They're actually kind of pleased.",
        "They say that there's about a factor of six less damage to the shuttle, and they've been looking at the shuttle very carefully from a lot of different angles since it lifted off and continuing in orbit."
