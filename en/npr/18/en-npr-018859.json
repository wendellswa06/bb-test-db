        "And the first deep-sea sounding technologies were not much more complicated.",
        "They experimented with different kinds of line, different weights of sinkers to make the line sink to the bottom, and detaching mechanisms to send more weight down and bring less weight up, but pretty simple technology.",

        "Ghannouchi himself talked about losing votes during that period.",

        "Is there democracy in Tunisia, and could this be the success story of the Arab Spring?",
