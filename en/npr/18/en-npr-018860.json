        "Thank you very much.",
        "I just wondered what kind of an influence the novel \"\"Moby Dick\"\" had on ocean exploration.",
        "Interesting.",
        "Dr. Rozwadowski, I think you might have something to say about that?",
        "...from the bathysphere over the NBC Radio Network in 1932.",
        "So they--that was a live broadcast from Bermuda?",
        "I do.",
        "A huge influence.",
        "Moby Dick,\"\" Melville's writings and maritime novels in general were part of a very strong wave--pardon the pun--of popular interest in the ocean and also representative of a new kind of person who was going to sea in the mid-19th century.",
        "Before the 19th century, you would only have gone to sea if you had to--if you were a sailor, if you were a career naval officer, a colonial official being sent somewhere.",
        "But what was different in the mid-19th century was that you had middle-class, educated landlubbers who would go to sea because they were pretty sure they would come back--it was a lot safer to go to sea.",
        "And you start getting people like Melville, like Richard Henry Dana, going to sea and writing about the experience of having been at sea.",
        "And that was a huge part of the development of scientific and cultural interest in the ocean.",
        "In other words, the development of scientific interest in the ocean was tremendously fueled by the development of, you know, the reading public's interest in reading about the ocean.",
        "And another novel to keep in mind--\"\"Moby Dick\"\" was important.",
        "So was Jules Verne, \"\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.\"\" That was tremendously important.",
        "That was about the deep ocean, and that was published in the 1860s for the first time.",
        "Troy, thanks very much for that question.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "I just wonder, would deep-sea research--I mean, this was a gentlemanly or gentlelady interest in this world, and perhaps from a few novelist.",
        "But would the world of deep-sea exploration really have taken off without the commercial interest in laying telegraph cables, because suddenly it became important to know what was down there?",
        "It probably would not have received much funding and attention if it wasn't for the submarine telegraph industry.",
        "But the initial exploration of the deep ocean by hydrographers was undertaken because of the huge expansion of shipping in the first half of the 19th century, which was a product of industrialization.",
        "But so was submarine telegraphy, and the idea of being able to communicate instantaneously across the ocean was fascinating to people.",
        "It was politically something that was very interesting to government leaders and to entrepreneurs, so there was a lot of motive."

        "But you might be surprised, actually.",
        "There were only a couple of--one real survey all the way across the Atlantic, and the first set of cable-laying efforts were made in the 1850s, and the cable was laid successfully in 1858 and worked for a month, and then it took a while, because of the Civil War, to gain momentum again for another set of cable-laying attempts.",
        "And there were no surveys--very few surveys, a little bit of detail work near the coast, before the second set of submarine telegraph cables.",
        "So there was a great deal of interest in the ocean, but people were pretty easily convinced that they'd figured out how to lay cables in the ocean, and that the Telegraph plateau, as they called it--the place where they discovered would be the right place to put the cable, was a safe place to put cables.",
        "We're talking with Helen Rozwadowski, the author of the book \"\"Fathoming the Ocean,\"\" and Brad Matsen, the author of another book called \"\"Descent,\"\" both about exploring under the ocean.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And we're interested in hearing your questions about the deep ocean.",
        "Our number is (800) 989-8255; that's (800) 989-TALK.",
        "The other thing that interests me in your book, Dr. Rozwadowski, was the unwillingness of some scientists to listen to what the whalers had to say, because they had learned a lot about the ocean from just experience.",
        "Right, and this was a broader issue in the professionalization of science.",
        "It didn't only happen in ocean science.",
        "There were--but in this case, there were fishermen and whalers who were learning a lot about the ocean, and sperm whalers, in particular, were learning a lot about parts of the ocean that no one else had visited, because sperm whales--right whales, which are the species that had been hunted commercially first, stay relatively close to shore, but when whalers had decimated those populations and put tryworks on vessels, they headed to the South Atlantic, they headed to the Pacific...",
        "I'm sorry--tryworks?",
        "What are those?",
        "Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "You dipped into jargon here.",
        "Tryworks are a furnace on board a ship to render the blubber into oil, so you don't have to take the whale back to shore to do that.",
        "I got it.",
        "So when you think about the kind of high days of the American whaling industry, you think of these four- and five-year voyages that--where these ships were essentially like the factory ships that were out there fishing in the 1950s and '60s that caught so many of the commercial fish in that era.",
        "So the sort of floating factory arrangement--these whalers were the first people in most parts of the Pacific, many parts of the Antarctic, and they were really the ones noticing that--how deep sperm whales dove, for example.",
        "So when scientists started asking themselves whether life could exist at great depth, whalers were sort of out there saying, `Well, of course it can.",
        "Look how deep these whales dive.",
        "And not all scientists were willing to take the word of whalers and fishermen, but some of them were, and those points of crossover were some of the points where that knowledge got transferred into the scientific literature."

        "Right.",
        "Brad Matsen, I wonder if I can just ask you briefly--when these two explorers went down in the bathysphere, did they learn anything interesting from a scientific point of view?",
        "It was the very first field science live broadcast in the history of the world.",
        "Wow.",
        "And we thought we had an original idea, I guess.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "There's probably nothing actually new under the sun.",
        "Well, Dr. Cary, I mean, what improvements--I mean, I'm sure there's been a vast number, but what are the major improvements that Alvin has over something like the bathysphere?",
        "A very cold one.",
        "They were the first people to observe the deterioration of light, for one thing, which was quite interesting, and Beebe took that very seriously.",
        "And then, of course, they looked outside and they saw animals that no one had ever seen before that had evolved in total darkness, which means that, in order to do the two things which life has to do on this planet, which is get a meal and get a date, they had to grow lights on their body.",
        "They had to figure out some way to attract other animals in total darkness.",
        "So they were able to look out the window--beyond about 1,500 feet, it's black--and see what was there.",
        "They contributed immensely to this romanticizing of the ocean, because they were front-page news on papers all around the world.",
        "They were celebrities as big as rock stars.",
        "And so all of a sudden, we've got these two guys sealed in a steel ball on the end of a cable off Bermuda on the front page of the paper, and the ocean is becoming an entirely different place with every report from Bermuda.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was really quite wonderful."

        "It--they're made up of basically minerals of sulfur and metals, the pyrites.",
