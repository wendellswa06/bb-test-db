        "No, I--oh, extremely brave!",
        "OK.",
        "But I can't imagine a four-foot sphere.",
        "I mean, with six feet we're cramped in there because of--well, obviously, with all the life support system that's in there and the communications equipment and everything else, we're crammed in there and literally lying on top of each other, so I can't imagine.",
        "With two feet less diameter, it must have been just an amazingly tight space for them to operate in.",
        "And...",
        "Joe and Dr. Cary, if I could interrupt...",
        "Sure.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Yes, hello.",
        "Well, I mean, obviously, one thing that Alvin has over the bathysphere is it's untethered.",
        "It's a free vehicle, so it's able to move away from the mother ship and move into kind of the nooks and crannies on the sea floor and operate at multiple angles very, very carefully and precisely.",
        "And I think that's what makes sort of a manned submersible, as opposed to, say, an ROV, essential.",
        "An ROV?",
        "Yeah.",
        "The ROVs are the remotely operated vehicles.",
        "There's a--right now there's a movement globally to incorporate unmanned sort of remote-operated vehicles to do--or to replace manned submersibles, or at least to take up some of the slack on the manned submersibles.",
        "Obviously, the advantage of a remotely operated vehicle is that you've got 24-hour presence on the sea floor, as opposed to Alvin, which can only be down for nine hours or so.",
        "And so--but, you know, there's a lot of us who believe that it's essential that we still visit the sea floor and that we get down there, because there's a lot of things that we do on the sea floor that we don't believe that the ROVs are capable of doing."

        "And I gather that Alvin is being retired.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Well, the Alvin's over 35 years old and has had a remarkable career.",
        "In fact, I would say that it's probably the most successful submersible ever--globally ever built, in terms of the number of dives per year that Alvin has done and the length of time it's been in service.",
        "There's been a lot of improvements made, both, you know, obviously in the material science area of the field, as well as in electronics that now sort of mandate that we need to develop and build a new submersible to accommodate some of the new needs of science that we're doing on the sea floor.",
        "OK.",
        "Let's see if we can get some of our callers to join this really interesting conversation.",

        "Hi.",

        "I just wondered if any of your guests know about that or know of any missions who are cooperating with NASA on that.",
        "Sort of a different kind of a challenge, but let's ask, Phil.",
        "Thanks for the question.",
        "You're welcome.",

        "Uh-huh.",
        "I'll take a stab.",
        "I mean, certainly, I'm very aware, and I think anybody who's been working in and around hydrothermal vents--very aware of the current sort of theories and speculation on Europa.",
        "NASA has been working with us in hydrothermal vent areas over the past 10 years or so.",
        "I've been working with several NASA engineers and NASA scientists.",
        "And I think what NASA's real interest is, is to try to figure out exactly what they need to do and what they need to build in order to access--the possibility of accessing hydrothermal systems on Europa.",
        "I mean, the theory is that below this very thick ice surface of Europa, that there's liquid water.",
        "And if there's liquid water there, then there has to be something that's maintaining that liquid.",
        "And the--if you take a look at Io, the nearest moon to Europa and the closest moon to Jupiter, it's a very volcanic--I think it's said to be the most volcanic feature in the solar system.",
        "And Europa is frozen, so it's believed.",
        "that maybe Europa is--has hydrothermal features associated with it that's keeping it liquid water.",
        "The difficulty, of course, is that there's a huge chunk of ice on the surface that they need to get through--kilometers of ice that they need to get through.",
        "And I know there's a lot of work that's going on right now at NASA to try to devise the technology to access that.",
        "Interesting.",
        "And once they break through, hopefully, those of us who have been working in vents over the last 20 years will be brought into the network at NASA so that we can help them begin to explore these features.",
        "Of course, I guess, as you say, if you did get as far as Europa, you'd still have to get through the top layer of ice to get down to the bottom to find the vents to see if there was something there, so it's a big challenge, I should think.",
        "That's not--you know, that's not a trivial task.",
        "No.",
        "No. Well, as I guess NASA has learned yet again today, getting into space just by itself is pretty tricky.",
        "But let's take another call.",
        "How about if we go to Sharon in East Hampton, New York?",
        "Sharon, welcome to the program.",
        "Oh, hi.",
        "I have two questions.",
        "One of them is: Can you go online and see any of the pictures from down below?",
        "Anyplace on line to see them?",
        "And the other...",
        "Well, let's take these one at a time.",

        "And, Sharon, your second question?",

        "Tell me if you know about the involvement of Ed Link in some of this deep-sea exploration, because I seem to remember in the '80s that he and his son went down in what I thought was the bathysphere, but maybe it wasn't, and then they unfortunately had some malfunctions and they never came up.",

        "I know it wasn't a bathysphere, because the last bathysphere dove in August of 1934 with William Beebe and Otis Barton in it, who by this time couldn't stand one another.",
        "After they made their last dive they never spoke to each other again, for that's what four and a half feet will do to you.",
        "But I don't know about the Link story.",
        "Maybe one of the other guests knows.",
