        "My new research project that I've just started working on is on undersea exploration in the 1950s and '60s, so I've been listening to all this with great interest.",
        "But Link was one of a--he was a singular individual, but one of a type of person who is very involved in the technology and made this kind of crossover.",
        "The designer of Alvin was this kind of person, too.",
        "A lot of people involved in ocean exploration were sort of combinations of scientists and engineers, people who were really good at sort of tinkering and making things better.",
        "And he was one of the people who was a pioneer of saturation diving and these things that led to not so much bathyspheres, but undersea habitats.",
        "So that's sort a pretty sketchy answer...",
        "Well...",
        "...but it would be not so much the bathysphere part of the story, but heading toward kind of the Jacques Cousteau, conch shell, Sealab part of the story, I would think.",
        "Interesting.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, we're talking this hour about exploring the deep oceans, and we're taking your calls.",
        "I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",

        "Brian, welcome to the program.",
        "Oh, thank you for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, I have really enjoyed this topic and, having worked in fisheries and as a scientific technician on the ocean a bit, this is a great topic.",
        "And this is--I just wanted to say that this is really the water planet, and we're covered mostly with water, and that I think that the exploration of inner space or that underwater space, where life exists and there is huge amounts of resources, kind of outweighs the benefit of exploring outer space with the same amount of money.",
        "And I was interested to think if--or to hear if your guests thought that, you know, tax funding of undersea research is as viable as outer-space research.",
        "Well, it's an interesting question, especially as we were talking earlier today about the space station and what it's going through.",
        "But, Brian, thanks for the call.",
        "Craig Cary, maybe I could start with you.",

        "I don't know if that's the case.",

        "Sorry, I was...",
        "But I think that that's a really, really good question, and I think that it's one that is a very provocative one.",
        "I think that NASA has done a tremendous job at promoting and building its program, and I think that we are very fortunate, I think, in the United States especially, to have a federal agency, the National Science Foundation, that sees it as a priority to continue to support deep-sea exploration.",
        "I think that there's always--I think--and anybody who's worked and is passionate about a field--there's always a feeling that there's a need to put more money into this.",
        "And there are certainly some very large programs that are currently being developed through the National Science Foundation to continue--not only to continue, but to build on what we've already done.",
        "The ocean is a big place and it's a very expensive proposition to go out there and do this type of work.",
        "And so it happens in small pieces, and there is a global an international desire, I think, now to start to coalesce some of the efforts from the other countries and bring them together in more collaborative efforts to do larger areas.",
        "The new Alvin--and I'm calling it Alvin because it hasn't been given a name yet, but the new submersible that's being built by the United States through the National Science Foundation, I think, will be ready in 2008, I heard, will have a new depth capability of 6,500 meters, as opposed to the 4,500-meter depth capability of Alvin, which will give us about 99 percent of the sea floor capability.",
        "So that's opening up a whole new area for us in the ocean.",
        "And I think that that's going to hopefully bring on a whole bunch of funding initiatives through the National Science Foundation.",
        "Well, it's...",
        "I'd also like to jump in, because one of the things...",
        "Well, Dr. Rozwadowski, very briefly...",
        "OK.",
        "...because we're almost out of time."
