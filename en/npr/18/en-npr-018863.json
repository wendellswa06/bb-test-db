        "By 1980, the number of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico in the U.S.",
        "was an estimated 1 and a half million, and it was about to balloon.",
        "The '80s witnessed what economist Michael Clemens calls a demographic an economic perfect storm - a Mexican economic crisis with lots of young Mexicans looking for work and a booming U.S.",
        "economy with fewer young Americans entering the workforce.",
        "Both of those things generated an opportunity for mutually beneficial exchange between the countries - a lot more people than jobs in Mexico, a lot more jobs than people in the United States.",
        "More Mexicans headed north.",
        "Jorge Castaneda is a Mexican political scientist.",
        "It makes an enormous amount of economic sense for any person in Mexico who has the drive and the money to go to the United States with or without papers to do so.",
        "That person can make seven, eight, perhaps even 10 times more than they make in Mexico.",
        "By 1986, an estimated 3 million immigrants were here illegally, and Washington acted.",
        "There was a bill that included the legalization of migrants who had been in the country for a few years, and President Ronald Reagan supported it.",

        "You're describing a situation that - what strikes me, I mean, you say it could be a loose confederacy on one hand or a civil war on the other.",
        "It sounds like you're pretty convinced that somehow the Russian-speaking part of Ukraine in the east is not going to be very unified with the west.",
        "Well, I'm very concerned, frankly, and I have been concerned for some time that the developments in Ukraine over the last three months were less unifying than divisive in terms of domestic Ukrainian politics.",
        "What does Russia do if there are parts of the east who come to Moscow and say, you know, send troops in?",
        "I mean, we want your support here in the east.",
        "Well, that's a really hard part.",
        "You see Russian flags already, now, flying in various Crimean cities.",
        "And there are people who are calling for closer ties with Russia, and at some point they may start talking about secession.",
        "Now, this is a very, very difficult, dangerous but important moment for Moscow.",
        "Moscow, in my view, needs to play its hands wisely not supporting the separatism that could give a pretext to Kiev to send in troops to restore constitutional order."

        "Why is it important for Moscow to stay out of it?",
        "Well, because Moscow would be distracted from the things that are far more important to Russia than redrawing the map of Eastern Europe.",
        "Russia is in no need of new territories or new citizens.",
        "Rather, Russia's best bet in Ukraine would be a Ukraine that's more democratic, more modern but also more decentralized.",

        "Then the real centerpiece of it, which was employer sanctions, was very weak.",
        "There was not really an effective way to enforce employer sanctions and lots of ways for both employers and workers to get around it.",
        "And the amnesty left out those who had been here less than five years.",
