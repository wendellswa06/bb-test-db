        "I understand that if we want to have a conversation about turkey hunting, you have to get me up to speed first on the lingo.",
        "So let's start with turkey calls.",
        "Tell me about them.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There's a whole series of turkey calls, and different sounds mean different things to turkeys.",
        "And what we're basically trying to do in the springtime was we're trying to imitate the calls that a hen would make to lure a gobbler within shooting range.",
        "And the predominant call is just - is a yelp like this one…",
        "(Soundbite of turkey hen call)",
        "And she just, kind of, making some sounds like that.",
        "She might be off on her own, this hen turkey, wandering in the woods; or she may be with other toms.",
        "When turkeys come down off of the roost, they're going to be making different sounds and calls as well.",
        "Sometimes, that particular hen will be doing some cuts to alert other birds of the flock.",
        "(Soundbite of turkey cut)",
        "And then she might just be clucking while she's feeding on some grasshoppers in the prairie.",
        "(Soundbite of turkey cluck)",
        "So you're pretending to be the hen in order to catch this gobbler during springtime, which is the mating season, I think.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We're in the heart of their breeding cycle right now, and we're trying to imitate their girlfriends to try to draw in one of those love-struck gobblers.",
        "Where do turkeys roost?",
        "Are they up in the trees?"

        "Yeah.",
        "Turkeys like to roost in trees at nighttime.",
        "In Nebraska, they are predominantly roosting in large, burrowed trees, large cotwood trees, that might overlook, kind of, a small, canyon-type area.",
        "That way, they have a great breadth to bevel, to see any predators that might come near them.",
        "But they love those large, older trees here in Nebraska for roost tree, because generally the whole flock can get into that tree.",
        "So if we're lucky enough to bag a turkey when we're out on our hunt, what's the next step?",
        "How do I get this ready to take to the table?",
        "Well, one of the things I like to do is I have, kind of, a roast-wild-turkey-in-a-sack type method.",
        "If folks remember one thing from our broadcast here today, it's moisture.",
        "I grease a bag inside with melted shortening.",
        "I brush that turkey with melted shortening, a little salt and pepper.",
        "I'll make a dressing, maybe adding some mushrooms and oysters.",
        "I stuff the bird, I fit this turkey into this cooking bag, and when it's done from the oven, I remove everything, but I don't open the sack of that wild turkey for at least 20 minutes because this allows the turkey - there we go - to absorb the steam for a moister meat.",
        "And that simple method right there is one of the greatest ways to prepare wild turkeys.",
        "Thanks again for talking with us.",
        "Thank you very much.",

        "The new oil law that Iraq's cabinet approved yesterday is politically significant.",
        "It says that oil revenue will be shared among the provinces or regions based on population.",
        "That was a key concern for Sunnis, but it also has big implications for oil companies around the world.",
        "The deal, which still has to be voted on by the Iraqi parliament, allows regional governments and oil companies to contract with foreign businesses.",

        "There is an enormous amount of oil in Iraq.",
        "The big question is, will foreign companies be willing to deal with the violence and the instability there in order to get to that oil.",
        "What do you think about that?",
        "I think that really is the key question, whether or not international oil companies and other actual, national oil companies - like the Chinese companies - will be willing to go in and deal with the security risk.",
        "National oil companies and international oil companies are both used to dealing with a fairly high level of security risk in places like Nigeria and elsewhere, but the question is, you know, this is a whole new level for a lot of these companies.",
        "And the reserves are certainly there, so the payoff is there, but the tradeoff is a risk.",
        "Part of it is really going to come down to the political situation in the country, and a big question that is out there is, you know, how long is the U.S.",
        "troop presence going to be there, and if it is drawn down or eventually withdrawn entirely, where that leaves the international oil companies as far as taking on security risks.",
        "Now you mentioned a few countries.",
        "What specific companies are interested?",
        "Just about every oil company in the world is taking a long, hard look at Iraq.",

        "The Chinese certainly are very interested.",
        "There are a number of Russian companies.",
        "Lukoil is leading the charge there.",
        "And even smaller players like Petrol Vietnam.",
        "So really the field is wide open.",
        "If everyone is lining up, will the Iraqis let everyone in, or will they be selective?",
        "And if they are, what will be the criteria?",
        "I think - I mean, there is a benefit to be selective.",
        "I mean, I think this is something that, you know, they should take some time to develop, figure out who the best partners are, who the right partners are.",
        "It's not just simply a question of investment or of dollars but it's also who's the right fit.",
        "Part of it may be a geo-strategic issue.",
        "If you could bring in a diversification of partners - the U.S., Russia, China, even India - I think that would be something that they would look for as well."
