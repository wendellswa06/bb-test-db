        "Exactly.",
        "And you know, again, if you look at some of the most successful TV shows that have recently, you know, come to the fore.",
        "If you think about \"\"Lost\"\" and \"\"Desperate Housewives\"\" and \"\"Ugly Betty\"\" and \"\"The Closer\"\" on cable, I mean, there's a long track record of shows that has significant characters of color who contribute to the action and are big part of the storyline doing well.",
        "So, you know, why is there so much reluctance to try and explore this storylines at a time when network TV viewership is down and network TV viewers are getting older because young people are turning to other sources of entertainment.",
        "If I could sort of piggy back on that for just a minute as someone who's actually worked in television, a lot of times what people don't realize is that there's a network behind the network.",
        "And by that, I mean, there's this group of people that you know, they call each other family and they keep hiring each other, you know.",
        "So that's kind of what happens behind the scenes.",
        "And if you look like - look at a guy like J.J.",
        "Abrams, you know, he's still pulling his cast from \"\"Felicity\"\" and casting them at all his shows and his - subsequently his movies.",
        "And so there's that element - often times it's not so much racism.",
        "It's nepotism.",
        "That is the bottom line.",
        "And it's - you know, Melanie, is it hard for African-American writers and show runners to get jobs?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I mean, if you look at - it's exactly what Miki was saying.",
        "If you look at the number of head writers or executive producers of shows that are black they're very few of them.",
        "If you consider that, and you consider the idea of you're going to mentor the people that you know, or that kind of thing...",
        "Right.",
        "It becomes very difficult for African-American writers to break in.",
        "And not only that, rise to the point where they would be given their own program.",
        "Someone that I know from college is one of the writers on \"\"Kyle XY.\"\" But one of the ways that he was able to get it was because he had a friend who was on the show who knew he could write and kind of got him in the door.",
        "Hmm.",
        "But yeah, he's an African-American writer and that's how he's getting a start is on \"\"Kyle XY.\"\" So, there's, you know, it takes a lot of different people to kind of give African-American writers opportunity in all parts of the industry.",
        "But if you're not getting any encouragement then there's not a whole of movement there in terms of getting the cast on the air, getting the subject matter out there.",
        "So, yeah, it's very difficult...",
        "And again..."

        "And again, you know, I don't want to present this as some sort of we-are-the-world feel good movement.",
        "This is about making TV better.",
        "This is about accessing story lines that wider ranges of people will find compelling.",
        "Right.",
        "Sorry (laughter).",
        "One of the things I want to just - to expand on what Eric just said.",
        "Notice he just mentioned Benjamin Bratt is going to be on a show on A&E called \"\"The Cleaner.\"\" You have the success of Tyler Perry with \"\"House of Pain\"\" on TBS.",
        "Cable, I think, seems to be more ready to kind of take up the charge in terms of having more diverse programming simply because a lot of cable networks are still in the beginning stages of program - having original programming on their network.",
        "And if you look at the way that things have worked recently, where if you've seen African-American shows or even, you know, you had \"\"Aliens in America.\"\" That was on the CW.",
        "That was on the smallest network that could.",
        "So,",
        "Yeah, really.",
        "Exactly.",
        "We're finally starting too.",
        "We're finally starting to.",
        "Yeah, that - that barely can.",
        "But now it's all kind of moving the cable and part of others.",
        "Two reasons, one, is because there are - these are all channels that are willing to take chances in their programming.",
        "And two, you know, cable is the land of niche, you know, if you can figure out a good place, a good slot to put these programs into then yes, it's probably, is easier to sell a more ethnically diverse program on you know, the A&Es and the TBSs, and I mean, goodness, the BET, VH1, that kind, you know.",
        "So, yes, cable I think is going to be the next place where you're going to see diversity kind of flourish.",
        "Before we let you guys go, what about reality television where often, in shows like the \"\"Flavor of Love.\"\" You have a lot of color but you don't know if you really want to see that much of it by the end of the show."

        "I think, reality TV has developed the strain of a black focused products that do the same thing.",
        "And it's unfortunate because they regurgitate a lot of stereotypes.",
