        "For Nicki, there's never any real consequences in her life to anything that she does.",

        "And so they go on such a journey, their characters have such arcs, they're kind of experiencing life for the first time.",
        "So, you see the story through new eyes.",

        "First is that people literally don't see him riding the bicycle.",
        "There's so much stimuli in urban environments that we miss things like that.",
        "Second is that they do see him, but what's happening is sort of ambiguous.",

        "That's right.",
        "And that was the most interesting thing about this to me, and that sort of falls into the ambiguity category, which is, yes, it's ambiguous what's happening, but what's also ambiguous is what heightens the ambiguity is the reactions of the other people around you.",
        "We take our cues from people who are in our, you know, right around us, basically.",
        "This is why comedy clubs hire professional laughers.",

        "And it was really - it was like a really nice experience, and I actually - I really, really remember it very vividly, and then that being kind of a nice thing because at least we know our car was going to be safe while we were in the city, being in the impound.",
        "You didn't get the boot off then?",
        "No.",
        "We certainly didn't - and it ended up costing us quite a bit, but like I said, I'll never forget those first New Yorkers who came to our defense.",
        "Thanks so much for the call, Graham.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Will Doig?",
        "You know what's interesting about that, is that we actually got a lot of defensive responses to this story from people saying, I live in the city and, you know, I experience acts of helpfulness all the time.",
        "And I live in the city as well, and I think that that's definitely true.",
        "A few things about that.",
        "First of all, I think it's often easier to see and remember acts of helping than non-acts of helping.",
        "You know, your caller might not even remember this incident except for the fact that everybody was trying to defend him because it's active.",
        "So, you know, if we leave work and we find that our bike has been stolen, we don't necessarily think about the people who might have seen it being stolen and didn't do anything.",
        "But if we find out that somebody tried to steal our bike and a stranger stopped him, that's memorable.",
        "And again, just to reiterate, this is not about sort of kindness versus cruelty of city people.",
        "I think that city people can be quite kind, but you know, it's just that - in fact, it's actually just the opposite of that.",
        "Research shows that it has more to do with environmental factors."
