        "Well, it's curious that our caller from Norman, Oklahoma there said it was a group of people who stood up to the policeman.",
        "Maybe they had strength in numbers.",
        "And if it would have just been one person passing along, they might not have done that.",
        "That is definitely true.",
        "I think a lot of this comes from the sort of legacy of the time when a lot of cities were much more dangerous, and you just didn't get involved in things because you could be put in harm's way if you did.",
        "And I think that's also a really good example of how learned behavior can trump the bystander effect.",
        "So for instance, you hear a lot of people talk about New York City right after 9/11 and everybody was so helpful to each other and really, if they saw somebody who needed help, they did something, even if it was a stranger.",
        "And I bet you that a lot of people in that crowd surrounding his car had gotten boots put on their car, gotten their own parking tickets and things like that, and they could relate.",
        "And so that really made a difference.",
        "All right.",
        "Andrew is on the line from Columbus, Ohio.",
        "Go right ahead.",
        "Well, this is my experience from about two years ago.",
        "I was in Philadelphia with my 6-year-old cousin, and we were just touring around Chinatown and it was just a really hectic, crazy afternoon and like it was literally like a highway of pedestrians going back and forth, like parallel, and somebody who was very, very callous and rude bumped into my 6-year-old cousin.",
        "She fell down and started crying like crazy and nobody would pick her up.",
        "Everybody started avoiding her.",
        "And I'm Asian and when I was a kid, I was always loved helping people.",
        "And so once in a while my parents would say, don't help him because they might think you did it or like I might get blamed for something.",
        "I was wondering if there would be like a cultural aspect or a factor that is involved in unkindness and that also correlates with urban areas.",
        "Will Doig?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "So one of the things that I did when I wrote this story was I actually walked around Manhattan a little bit with a blind New Yorker to sort of see - basically, we just walked around for a bit, and then we stopped and I kind of, you know, hang back, and we stopped to see if people would help him cross the street.",
        "And what people did was they would tell him when the light would change and it was time for him to cross, but they didn't actually take his arm and help him across the street like you might find in a rural area or even other cities.",
        "And I think that that is a real example of where culture comes into this, because in a place like New York, which is basically home of the speed walker, you know, people - maybe people don't feel comfortable taking a stranger by the arm, or they think that the blind person wouldn't feel comfortable with them taking their arm.",
        "And I think that that really does play into this a lot as well.",
        "Another thing about cultural differences is that one psychologist has actually studied this effect in multiple cities all around the world.",
        "It was a huge study, and he found that in certain cities this does - people are more willing to intervene, but it's, again, not because they are, you know, have better ethics as individuals necessarily.",
        "It's because it fits in with cultural norms in those cities.",
        "All right.",
        "Andrew, thanks for the call.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "Let's take a call now from Sachia(ph) in Baltimore County, Maryland.",

        "Hi.",
        "How are you?",
        "Good.",
        "And I have a funny story.",
        "I visited a friend from New York and she lives there, and I first started - because I was sitting on the stoop and she wasn't home, I was reading a book, and her neighbor comes - came home.",
        "I said hello to him, and he said, excuse me?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "And he said it with such - that no one had ever said hello to him (unintelligible) I chuckled and I said hello.",
        "He said, hello, and then went into his house quickly.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "And so later, I went to – actually, he live in Brooklyn.",
        "I went to the Brooklyn Museum.",
        "Every time I went to the train station, when I went to the museum - every time I walk (unintelligible) and say hello, they'd say, excuse me?",
        "And so when she came home, I told her how funny it was, that she had never experienced it.",
        "We went out.",
        "We went to a pizza place in Brooklyn.",
        "The waitress came to the table.",
        "I said, hello.",
        "How are you?",
        "She said, excuse me?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Like no one had expected to be spoken to, and it wasn't offensive.",
        "It was really, really funny because they all had this curious - curiousness to them when I said hello, like literally.",
        "And all I was saying was hello.",
        "Well, maybe you changed their lives.",
        "Maybe they went on to think about it and say hello after that."

        "I'm sorry.",
        "I mean, I know how to say hello.",

        "I clearly wasn't, asked for 911.",
        "There were four people, excluding my friend, who were sitting about - at arm's length from me, maybe a little bit further, and they ignored it.",

        "You know, that sounds like a more extreme example than usual, but it is true that part of the reason that people don't intervene a lot of the time - and this speaks to ambiguity of the situation as well, I think, is that they're afraid of looking foolish.",
        "You know, if you don't see anybody else doing something, for instance, nobody else at that table was doing anything...",
        "Although her friend, I thought she said, was giving the Heimlich.",
        "Well, until - right, but the other people - I guess one person reacted.",
        "But if most people are not doing anything, then there is this sense that you don't want to be like the one person who does, and it sounds like her friend might have some sort of quality where they are, you know, less, I guess, subject to worrying about looking foolish or something like that.",
        "All right.",

        "Yes, about Boston.",
        "(Unintelligible) happy – it started off bad.",
        "I was hit on the passenger side of my car, lost on a street that I was unfamiliar with.",
        "But, gee, a good Samaritan, a young man in a pick-up truck stopped, saw the damage to my car, to the passenger side, to the door, the passenger door, and was (unintelligible) in his pick-up, managed to patch up the bad side of the car so that I was able to get in my car and brought my self home to Framingham, 21 miles west of Boston.",
        "Oh, so it made you feel better about a bad situation there.",
        "And I've never forgotten that incident and that young man.",
        "Thank you so much, Nancy.",
        "Will Doig, I was fascinated that the researchers actually find that acts of meanness and kindness, or attitudes, vary from city to city.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They can vary dramatically.",
        "In fact, just to give you an example, in Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries and cities, people are much more likely to intervene with strangers.",
        "And they looked into this and they found - or they theorized that the reason was because there's a word simpatico, which doesn't have an equivalent in English, that basically means helpful, agreeable, easy to get along with.",
        "And one of the best ways to show that you have this desirable trait is to help other people in full view of other people.",
        "Huh.",
        "And is there some correlation here as to what makes the difference - density, I think, also came up in one study?"
