        "And the people that put the wrong people in those positions need to be held accountable.",
        "But, at the same time, we have to look at the whole big picture.",
        "And so I think a lot of it just comes back to having standards on how we deal with the public health of students in general and not look at it as one person failed.",
        "Because those people need to be held accountable, but it's not - that's not how you fix that.",
        "And so I think a lot of it just goes back to social workers and schools and actually creating a culture that cares about our teachers and values our students' lives and doesn't help fuel the school to prison pipeline.",
