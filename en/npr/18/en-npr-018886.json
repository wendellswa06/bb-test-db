        "I mean, Michael Vick, you know, probably would be a great dog owner because, as I say, he has faced, you know, God in the eye.",
        "And as you point out, his athletic performance, that was the first turning point, because it showed a maturity he never had.",
        "Michael Vick, when he was a football player both at Virginia Tech and the Atlanta Falcons, thought: I can always get by on my athletic ability.",
        "He did not look at the playbooks.",
        "He did not learn plays.",

        "Look, I don't - young kids may idolize him because he's a great, great athlete.",

        "That's absurd.",
        "I don't see a man, a Michael Vick, denying the hideousness of what he did.",
        "And I think that's a big step forward.",
        "And as I say, he's gotten a ton of publicity, and I thought he would get overexposed and implode and say something terrible, and all of it would go to his head.",
