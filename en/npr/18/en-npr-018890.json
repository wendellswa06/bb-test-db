        "What do you say to people who say, well, but, yeah, but this is run by the Pentagon.",
        "These are all Defense Department.",
        "What do we get out of this, as civilians?",
        "What we get out of it is, to me, it's fascinating, and this is why I wrote this book.",
        "I wanted to - the more I learned about DARPA - sort of by osmosis on another project that I was working on - the more I was fascinated by this idea that this Pentagon agency had funded so many of the technologies that we, as civilians, use every day - of course, the Internet and a lot of the technologies behind GPS, things like this.",
        "It turns out that because DARPA doesn't have its own labs and that they have to have outsource everything, the groups that it funds are then free to market the technologies - at least the ones that aren't secret - as they see fit.",
        "In fact, DARPA prefers that they do that, because that means that they don't have to continue nurturing those technologies once they're proven to be effective or possible.",
        "Then they can move to the next impossible task instead of having to worry about, okay, let's, you know, keep these other projects going to the point where everyone can use them.",
        "No, no, no. We've already proven that's possible.",
        "We've proven that cars can drive themselves, that you can put a GPS in this -into a size of a cigarette pack, or you can network computers.",
        "Now it's up to the people we funded to go and see what they can do with that and hopefully bring it to a marketplace where it can be then just bought on the open market.",
        "Or create robotic artificial limbs for wounded soldiers.",
        "That's one of the projects, yeah, followed in the book.",
        "Can we build a limb that is basically indistinguishable from a natural arm?",
        "So if you're missing an arm, you get this new prosthetic that can sense and move and operate like a natural arm.",
        "And that's typically ambitious, and they call that DARPA hard.",
        "Let's try something that just seems completely insane, totally, you know, crazy, ambitious.",
        "And in that case, they didn't get there.",
        "They didn't quite get to that point.",
        "But they did a get a lot of these technologies in motion for...",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "After two to six years, they're gone or their expiration dates are printed on their ID badges.",
        "So they've got this turnover, 25 percent every single year.",
