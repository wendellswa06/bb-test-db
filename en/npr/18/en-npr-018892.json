        "For 100 years, we have attempted to find the needle in the haystack.",
        "And now starting today, the job of FDA and USDA will be to try to prevent needles from getting into the haystack in the first place.",
        "Consumer groups, too, are generally pleased, though they, like the trade groups, are anxious to see the details.",
        "And Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in the Public Interest wants more.",
        "We really don't have a good handle on the imports that are coming into the U.S.",
        "We also are lacking a - really, a common structure, a common philosophy for food safety regulation.",
        "Some of that common structure may come from legislation that's working its way through Congress now.",

        "This first-time novelist has helped us to travel that brief but crucial distance, from words on the page to dreams in our minds and hearts, and made this bitter, brutal time somehow reachable."

        "You know, let me ask you for some perspective here.",
        "There were always southern Democrats, and then suddenly there were southern Republicans.",
        "What makes a Democrat in the South a Democrat today rather than a Republican if that person is running with many of the same positions that a conservative Republican might run on?",
        "Perhaps electable.",
        "Electable?",
        "Now, why electable all of a sudden this year and not the last 20 years?",
        "Well, I think the Republicans are in a lot of trouble across the nation and also in the South.",
        "I think the Democrat who won would say he would differ from his Republican opponent on maybe economic issues, taxes, corporations, foreign policy, war in Iraq.",
        "But where the Democrat is more similar would be on these cultural questions, like attitude toward religion, abortion, guns, those kinds of things.",
        "You know, it's been popular wisdom, and actually the case politically for quite some time now, that Democrats can't win in the South on the national level.",
        "Is that starting to erode?",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "What we've seen in the last two election cycles - in 2006 the Democrats picked up seats in the South.",
        "The Republicans still have a majority of the congressional delegation in the southern states, but it's a smaller majority than it was in 2004.",
        "And so the tides are really running, I think, in the favor of the Democrats."

        "How will you see that playing?",
        "Well, in southern elections an African-American candidate who runs as a liberal has not really been much more successful than white candidates who've run as liberals.",
        "It's difficult for a white liberal, like a John Kerry or an All Gore, to win in the South.",
        "And then you add race to that; I think that makes it perhaps an even greater challenge for Obama.",
        "On the other hand, what he has going for him is what will be, I think, the largest turnout of African-Americans in the history of the United States.",
        "Then he'll need a smaller share of whites to combine with the African-American vote in order to produce victories in that state.",
        "So that gives him an opportunity.",
