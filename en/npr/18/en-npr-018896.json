        "Happy to be here, Melissa.",
        "Your last survey was two years ago.",
        "This one was taken within the last two months or so.",
        "What's the most dramatic shift, do you think, that you found?",
        "Most dramatic shift is the extent to which centrism is the dominant factor in public opinion in the beginning of the Obama era.",
        "We see the number of political independents at a 70-year high, the Republican Party having lost a lot of adherents and even the Democrats having lost some, coming after the post-election boost that they got.",
        "And, most importantly, even though it was a big Democratic win and the Republicans are in freefall, there's no signs of an ideological shift in the public.",
        "Values are pretty much the same.",
        "It's not like the mid-'90s, when we were showing the public becoming more conservative or, at the beginning of this decade, showing the public was more partisan.",
        "The public remains pretty much where it was two years ago on very basic values.",
        "Do you think it's right, though, to equate a growing number of independents with increased centrism?",
        "I was struck by one number you found, which is that of that independent group, 33 percent of them say they're conservative.",
        "Only 17 percent of them lean Democratic.",
        "So is it just a label, as opposed to a really core belief?",
        "Well, if you look at what they say and the way they act, you would say that they are unbalanced centrists.",
        "They tend to have relatively conservative views about government, about regulation and come closer to the Republican point of view.",
        "But when you get to the hot-button social issues or religion or views about national security, they're right with the Democrats.",
        "They provide the balance.",
        "That's, in large part, why we haven't seen much in the way of shift.",
        "If there's going to be a shift in opinions, if we're going to have an ideological realignment, these independents have to move in some direction.",
        "They haven't done it yet.",
        "You know, with the election of our first African-American president, did you detect any kind of movement in either racial attitudes or a shift among the blacks you surveyed of their views toward government and where the country is right now?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Post the election of Barack Obama, we find African-Americans having a much more positive view of American society.",
        "A greater percentage of them - 62 percent versus 40 percent two years ago - say that this country can solve its problems.",
        "More African-Americans feel that voting gives them a say in the government than felt that way two years ago.",
        "And a greater percentage of them say that blacks are making progress in this country.",
        "Among whites, there's an even larger percentage, as there typically have been, saying that African- Americans are making progress.",
        "Andy, the biggest surprise for you - anything in here that made you just kind of scratch your head and wonder if you were reading the numbers right?",
        "The biggest surprise for me was that people's attitudes toward business and the free market and Wall Street didn't change all that much.",
        "The public continues to think that business is what makes this country successful.",
        "And they are very reluctant about regulation.",
        "Now, this is mostly the views of Republicans, but independents join them in this perception - and some Democrats, but less often Democrats.",
        "Andy Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.",
        "Andy, thanks very much."

        "But cameras watching the Tuesday launch saw something they didn't want to see: a chunk of debris, most likely foam insulation, flaking off from the shuttle's external fuel tank.",
        "It's the kind of flaw thought to be responsible for the damage that led to the Columbia disaster.",
        "This time, at least, the foam debris didn't appear to strike the shuttle, so NASA engineers don't think Discovery is threatened, but they have grounded the shuttle fleet again as engineers look for a solution to a problem they thought they had under control.",

        "That's right.",
        "They have a few more that they've seen that are bigger than the allowable size they had planned for.",
        "But the one that they're really worried about is the one that weighed almost a pound that came off an area that they had decided not to work on because they thought they understood what was keeping the foam stuck to the tank there.",
        "So this is a different place than the foam that broke off that actually wound up punching a hole in the wing in Columbia and caused that to burn up on entry.",
        "That's right, but it's the same kind of foam.",
        "The foam that brought down Columbia and the foam that they saw on launch this week were both hand-applied foam ramps designed to protect structure from the aerodynamic pressures that the tank encounters during the ascent, which gets pretty fast.",
        "It protects cables from the wind, basically.",

        "Well, actually, we just had a conversation with Richard Covey, the astronaut that was appointed to kind of look over NASA's shoulder as they prepared to return to flight.",
        "And basically, they didn't understand what happened.",
        "They thought that the foam came off because of voids, small spaces, inside the hand-applied areas that allowed gas and liquid to expand as the flight continued and literally popped pieces of foam off.",
        "They're pretty sure that's what happened to Columbia.",
        "In this case, they had X-rayed this area.",
        "They didn't see any voids and the foam still came off.",
        "So they're--they need to have a better understanding of what Covey called the physics of this phenomenon.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "And, you know, there's been a suggestion that if you look you'll find.",
        "I mean, they've been watching this from all kinds of spectacular angles, including a camera mounted on the external fuel tank.",
        "Some have suggested that this, you know, foam may have popped off before and just nobody ever saw it because the external fuel tank burns up on re-entry.",
        "That's right.",
        "They--in fact, this piece of foam coming off was actually seen with that camera you just mentioned.",
        "They have a lot more data than they've ever had on the condition of the shuttle after it reaches space, and they've seen a lot more.",
        "They're actually kind of pleased.",
        "They say that there's about a factor of six less damage to the shuttle, and they've been looking at the shuttle very carefully from a lot of different angles since it lifted off and continuing in orbit.",
        "I got it.",
        "So in the meantime, they're still staying with the explanation that whatever flaked off didn't seem to hit the shuttle and they don't think Discovery's in any kind of danger.",
        "No, they don't.",
        "They think it's--they haven't completely cleared it for landing, but they--so far, they haven't found anything that's startling to them.",
        "And today, they went back and did what they call focused inspections with a sensor mounted on a long boom that can basically see just about the whole space shuttle, and they didn't see anything, as far as I know, that troubled them."
