        "How come they don't just put either some kind of Kevlar netting or chopped Kevlar long fiber in the foam as they're applying it?",
        "And wouldn't that solve the problem of pieces fracturing?",
        "Interesting.",
        "Frank, do you have any ideas on that?",
        "Not really.",
        "That--they--I believe they have looked at netting.",
        "I don't know why they didn't use it, although weight might be a consideration.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, Matt, it sounds like an interesting idea.",

        "Hi.",
        "One of the strangest things--I didn't hear the actual text of the interview, but the flight commander said, `I thought NASA had solved that problem.",
        "And it was a reflexive comment.",
        "She must have been assured that there was no problem, and, clearly, there is.",
        "How serious, we don't know.",
        "I'd like to hear your guest, Joe, if he heard that interview, explain the spontaneous remark that indicated or caused me great concern about the program.",
        "Interesting.",
        "Thanks for that call, Jerry.",
        "What about that, Frank Morring?",
        "Do you think that Eileen Collins, the commander of the mission, was not told all the information?",
        "I'm pretty sure she knew as much about the condition of the shuttle as anyone did when she lifted off.",
        "I think everyone at NASA was surprised that a piece this large came off.",
        "They thought they had solved the problem and they admitted up front that they were wrong.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Is this going to have any impact on the mission that they're supposed to be carrying out?",
        "They're obviously--they're at the space station now.",
        "They have a space walk planned for tomorrow where they're going to test some of these new repair things they were going to try out if a piece of foam--I mean, a piece of insulating tile came off or something.",
        "But what about other things?",
        "Can they do anything that will help them for the future?",
        "Actually, they're studying right now, if they can extend the mission by one day, to better prepare the space station for another hiatus in deliveries by the space shuttle.",
        "They can still get supplies via Russian progress vehicles and crews can still ride the Soyuz vehicles up and down, but they're going to try to do as much as they can.",
        "They mentioned a few specific things.",
        "They're going to leave a couple of laptops from the shuttle.",
        "Those things tend to wear out pretty fast in space, and so they're going to leave the Discovery laptops on board.",
        "They may even move some food over and extra water, more water than they had planned.",
        "But they're also going to carry out their original mission plan.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "It doesn't sound like they--I mean, it sounded like they were pretty packed up to start with when they launched.",
        "It didn't sound like they had a lot of extra stuff to leave behind.",
        "That's right.",
        "So--and does NASA--I mean, I guess they're in the mode of wait and see at the moment, but they're not saying how long they think the fleet might have to stand down, are they?",

        "My question is regarding the real use for the space shuttle.",
        "If we're just using it to resupply the space station and any experiment that can be done on the space shuttle can be done on the space station, why don't we transfer the funds from the space shuttle, which is an aging technology, to something more efficient, to development and the experiments that can be carried out in space--have them carried out on the space station since that's what it's designed for anyway?",
        "Huh.",
        "OK.",
        "Interesting point, David.",
        "What about that, Frank Morring?",
        "Can--is there another way to get people up and down to the space station?",
        "Well, certainly, there is.",
        "As I mentioned, the Russian systems are--have been carrying the load for the past two and a half years.",
        "The problem is that the space station isn't completed and a lot of the modules and other parts that are going--that were built and have been built and have been delivered to Cape Ken--Cape Canaveral to be launched on the shuttle can only be launched on the shuttle.",
        "So NASA's problem is getting as much of that stuff up to the station as they can.",
        "A lot of it belongs to NASA's international partners, the European Space Agency, the Japanese space agency, and those people are going to be very unhappy if the billions of dollars that they've spent building their hardware doesn't get launched on the space shuttle.",
        "And, in fact, it's NASA's stated policy that they will launch as much of that stuff as they can.",
        "OK.",
        "David, thanks very much.",
        "I think we have time for one more call.",
        "Let's try Mary in Virginia.",

        "Hi.",
        "I hope I'm coming through OK.",
        "I'm calling on my cell phone.",
        "My question is, I heard earlier in the interview where they were discussing with--the problem they had with the insulation coming off, that they thought they had fixed the problem and (technical difficulties) have an ulterior plan or did they have something set up in order to counteract the problem if it did happen?",
        "Yeah, I think I understand.",
        "Mary, I'm going to take the liberty of asking was--if there was as problem, was there a way to rescue the shuttle astronauts in an--was there a scenario for getting them back safely?",
        "There was.",
        "There's a space--another shuttle stacked up and almost ready to go down at the Cape right now.",
        "Unfortunately, it also has a tank on it.",
        "The idea was for the crew to stay on the space station until that shuttle could come up and rescue them.",
        "It's called the safe haven approach.",
        "They also have some experimental repair kits on the station, which they're going to be testing tomorrow morning, in fact, but no one really knows if that stuff works.",
        "And they probably wouldn't try to fly back on a repair made with that equipment."
