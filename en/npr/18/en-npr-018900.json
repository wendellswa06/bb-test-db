        "First I'm going to start with a basic question for you, Dr. Steele.",
        "I've heard the term Gulf War Syndrome for many years, then the term Gulf War Illness.",
        "There's also Chronic Multi-symptom Illness.",
        "What term, Dr. Steele, do you use and why?",
        "Well, I use the term Gulf War Illness, and that's probably the term used most widely today.",
        "The original phrase Gulf War Syndrome was used soon after the Gulf War and was coined by the media but never really took off with either government agencies or scientists.",
        "Gulf War Illness is now used as more of an umbrella term to refer to this complex of symptoms that we see in 1991 Gulf War veterans.",
        "Well, you're making you know, sloppy joes for seven kids or two kids, and who is doing the dishes.",
        "And, were you sharing the room that night or were you not.",
        "The other term that you mentioned, Chronic Multi-symptom Illness, that was coined in a paper produced in 1998 by Dr. Keiji Fukuda to refer to a symptom profile that they studied in Air National Guard units who had served in the 1991 Gulf War.",
        "It's used in some places, often by the VA in different ways, but overall most scientists, as well as the Department of Defense, use the term Gulf War Illness most commonly.",
        "Now Dr. deGruy, the Institute of Medicine uses the term Chronic Multi-symptom Illness.",
        "Does that term mean something different to you?",
        "Is that the term you use?",
        "Well, it's a term I use, but it's only by convention and convenience.",
        "I think we're talking about the same thing.",
        "The term Chronic Multi-symptom Illness certainly includes syndromes in populations that go beyond veterans of the Gulf War.",
        "So it broadens - it both broadens and complicates the amount of information we have about people who suffer from illnesses characterized by many unexplained symptoms.",
        "Now Dr. Forsythe, is there an agreed-upon diagnosis here?",
        "How exactly is Gulf War Illness, or whatever we'll call it, how is this diagnosed?",
        "Well, that's part of the challenge that we face so that diagnosing Gulf War veterans because of the variety of symptoms that they present with, as Dr. Steele said, under this umbrella term, makes it very, very difficult.",
        "So what generally has been done is that they have been categorized as ill.",
        "Gulf War veterans are suffering from Gulf War Illness if they meet the criteria of several established case definitions.",
        "And the case definitions touch on different aspects or categories of symptoms and symptom clusters.",
        "So the CDC, for example, talks about fatigue or mood and cognition.",
        "Those are two.",
        "And then musculoskeletal symptoms and pain, whereas the Kansas criteria that Dr. Steele can talk to you about in some depth has six.",
        "So, you know, that includes fatigue, pain and neurocognitive mood but also incorporates gastrointestinal, respiratory and skin symptoms.",
        "So there are different case definitions for Gulf War Illness, and again that makes it much more challenging."
