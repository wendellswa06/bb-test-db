        "OK, so Dr. Steele, why is it like this?",
        "Why is it so confusing?",
        "Well, it's not all that confusing if you're just looking at the data that we have from many studies.",
        "These studies consistently show a similar symptom pattern in different groups of Gulf War veterans from across the U.S.",
        "and in allied countries, as well.",
        "The problem is how we scientists have chosen to define it, you know, how many symptoms from which category we will use to establish a case definition.",
        "And thus far, no government agency or official body has stepped forward to identify sort of an official case definition for Gulf War Illness.",
        "Scientists in this area would really like to see that happen, but it just hasn't happened yet.",
        "So Dr. Steele, what do we know about the causes?",
        "Because there have been a number that we've heard about over the years.",
        "Maybe we can run through a few of them.",
        "One of the things that is mentioned sometimes is stress or PTSD, something that we've heard a lot about from these last few wars, Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "How much does stress have to do with it, do you think?",
        "That's a really good question.",
        "I think for many years after 1991, after the war got over, a lot of folks really didn't know what to make of Gulf War Illness or Gulf War Syndrome.",
        "But at this point, now 22 years later, we actually have a lot of students that tell us a lot about what may have caused Gulf War Illness.",
        "Most of the studies early on looked at things like stress and post-traumatic stress disorder, but we now know very definitely that Gulf War Illness, specifically in 1991 Gulf War veterans, is not a stress-induced or trauma-induced kind of disorder.",
        "The rates of things like post-traumatic stress disorder are very low in 1991 Gulf War veterans, much lower than we're seeing in current returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "However, there is a long list of potential causes that different people have looked at over the years, many things like the vaccines that veterans receive, the oil well fires that many of us remember from that time, all kinds of chemical toxicants that they were exposed to.",
        "And just looking over the broad range of studies, at the many epidemiologic studies that have been conducted in this population, we know that several of these risk factors or toxicants have risen to the top in terms of the strength of evidence that suggests that they are connected with Gulf War Illness.",
        "And at this point we can say that the highest risk factors relate to use of prophylactic medication given to veterans to protect them from nerve agents.",
        "That pill was called pyridostigmine bromide.",
        "In addition, there was extreme overuse of pesticides in some groups of veterans during the 1991 Gulf War.",
        "And so those are also linked to higher rates of Gulf War Illness.",
        "And then we also know that some veterans were exposed to very low levels of nerve agents during the Gulf War, and there's also some evidence some evidence supporting an association between Gulf War Illness and the nerve agent exposures that happened during and after the war."

        "Overall, though, the studies consistently show no link between for example serving in combat and higher rates of Gulf War Illness.",
        "So these PB pills you're talking about were meant to protect against the nerve agents, but then the nerve agents themselves are also potentially seen as a cause.",
        "That's true.",
        "And in terms of nerve agents, it's very hard to know who was actually exposed and who wasn't.",
        "So that's harder to get definitively.",

        "Dr.",
        "deGruy, do you have an opinion on what the causes of Gulf War Illness might be?",
        "This is a multi-factorial problem that's really difficult to sort out.",
        "There are populations that have been exposed to physical agents, chemical agents, biologic agents, who have been deployed in high-stress situations, who have been exposed to those agents but not deployed.",
        "We've got a variety of cohorts that converge on a similar set of symptoms.",
        "Everything you just heard in terms of potential etiologic factors I agree with.",
        "I also think that certain highly stressful situations contribute to the manifestation of symptoms.",
        "It's an incredible multi-factorial panoply of factors that converge to produce the syndrome, and it's not clear that we're ever going to - that we're ever going to be able to find a single etiologic explanation that helps us treat in a curative or definitive fashion.",

        "Because you're trying to treat these veterans.",
        "So do we need to know more about what caused it in the first place?",
        "Well, you can approach it from that perspective, that once you know what caused it, then you can treat it.",
        "You can also approach it from the perspective that once you know the symptoms, you can treat the symptoms, or you can dig deeper and try to find out what some of the underlying physiological situations are now that are transpiring with these veterans because we're so far downstream from the acute exposures, we're dealing with chronic exposure situations here with these veterans."

        "So what actually triggered that event may not be as important as what the sequeli are and what has happened to them since then.",

        "But the science and the massive amount of research that's been done in different Gulf War veteran populations, clearly shows high exposures to oil well fire smoke, pyridostigmine bromide, many of the other things he described.",
        "He's certainly not alone, and also the symptoms that he's developed since the war are certainly similar to what we hear very commonly.",

        "And to put that in perspective, that's more than one in three of us, and I'll say that again, more than one in three who served in the 1991 Gulf War are still today suffering from Gulf War Illness issues.",
        "We talked about the nerve agents, these pesticides, the PB pills that you say that you know that you were exposed to, Anthony Hardie.",

        "So there is some very strong evidence out there.",
        "And we're also starting to see now, again, I talked earlier about, you know, the sequeli that are developing, and that's what Anthony was just referring to.",
