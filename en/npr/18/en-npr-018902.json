        "So one was just highlighted in the USA Today, yesterday, and that's a study that we funded out of our office, Dr. Ronald - Dr. James Baraniuk who's at Georgetown University.",
        "And he found some very significant associations between blood flow and links in the brain that control fatigue, pain, emotion and reward and also cognition, those different parts of the frontal brain that affect those higher types of functions.",
        "And those were different on functional MRI from a matched set of subjects who do not have Gulf War Illness.",
        "So, I mean, we're starting to see some really very conclusive evidence in terms of what the status is of these veterans now.",
        "So Anthony Hardie, does this - does it matter to you at this point if the cause of Gulf War Illness is actually found?",
        "That's a wonderful question.",
        "It's debated widely in the Gulf War veteran communities.",
        "And for me personally, I'm less concerned about what the specific cause is.",
        "I think there were countless toxins that alone we've seen studies that have demonstrated in animals and in others that some of these could cause Gulf War illness symptoms alone.",
        "But I think what, to me, is most important of all - and I should say this is coming from the perspective of someone who has served on this panel of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research program, has seen virtually every research proposal that's been proposed regarding treatments in - since 2006, in the history of this program.",
        "To me, what's most - what's really clear that many researchers are making great strides towards unraveling and treating Gulf War illness without the need to know the specific substance of causation.",
        "And in unraveling the specifics of what's happening now in our brains and bodies of us Gulf War veterans appears to be at least as relevant, if not more relevant to the identification and treatment - and development of effective treatments.",
        "And I think us Gulf War vets, most importantly, to - it's almost everyone I hear from, is we simply want to see an improvement in our health.",

        "There are actually a number of studies, and they have identified high rates of diagnosable fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome in Gulf War veterans.",
        "But certainly, these syndromes do not account for all the multi-symptom illness that we see in Gulf War veterans.",
        "And in the biological studies that compare veterans with Gulf War illness to people with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, we see some similarities and some differences.",
        "So I think most of us believe at this point that there may be some similarities in the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with these conditions, but they are not identical.",

        "Yes.",
        "Actually, the veterans who have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan certainly have some serious problems, and many of them are associated with symptoms.",
        "But the symptoms have some overlap with what we see in Gulf War illness, so some of the neurological problems, et cetera, that we see in Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are associated with traumatic brain injury, can be associated with post-traumatic stress disorder.",
        "Yeah, and I apologize, but this is in the latest Institute of Medicine reporting.",
        "It includes a line about many symptoms reported in Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans, including headaches, chronic pain, disrupted sleep, fatigue and attention memory problems overlap with these symptoms experienced by 1991 Gulf War veterans.",
        "I was actually asking a different question.",
        "I'll put that quickly to Dr. deGruy, though.",
        "What does that mean, that there is this overlap between people in this Iraq and Afghanistan theater and the Gulf War back in 1991?"

        "What are some things that you see as promising right now?",
        "Well, we have a number of studies that are ongoing.",
        "And one of the things I just wanted to mention briefly is that we're poised to make two large awards to start - two consortia that will be bringing experts in the field of Gulf War illness together, to study different overarching questions related to Gulf War illness and to be able to pool their resources synergistically and study larger numbers of veterans than we have been able to do to date.",
        "So we're excited about those.",
        "Those are, as I said, those are in the wings.",
        "Those are coming.",
        "And part of their goals will be to look at, develop and identify new treatments.",
        "But we have a couple of things in small studies from - that were previously funded.",
        "We have one that was looking at the use of Coenzyme Q10 that had some limited applicability, it seemed, to help veterans with their sensations of fatigue after exertion, which is important.",
        "Because if you don't get so tired when you do minimal activities and you can do more, that might help other areas of your own health.",
        "We've also had a study that just concluded, looking at the value of acupuncture in treating the symptoms, again, of Gulf War illness - not getting at the causative factors, but treating the symptoms of Gulf War illness.",
        "And that also seems to have promise for those veterans who were included in that study.",
        "Those both need to be replicated in larger samples in order to be able to yield real results.",
        "We just also had a study that concluded Dr. Ronald Bach, who's at the Minneapolis VA, and he was looking for immune ties to Gulf War illness and as markers of systemic inflammation.",
        "And what he had found was - and this may lead to treatments.",
        "This is why I'm telling you this.",
        "A substance called C-reactive protein, which is a marker of systemic inflammation in the body, and that those levels were significantly higher in ill Gulf War veterans and - versus their asymptomatic counterparts.",
        "And he has identified what he calls the Gulf War proteome, which is a collection of 18 plasma proteins that include cytokines, metabolic factors, some growth factors and other factors involved in tissue modeling, that, taken together, they demonstrate a signature, if you will, that identifies the ill - identify the ill Gulf War veterans in that sample from their, again, their non-ill counterparts.",
        "Well, and we're running a bit low on time, I want to ask Dr. Steele, as we wrap up: What you hope happens next?",
        "You've been studying this for quite some time, and we've been wondering whether or not we're going to get to some sort of a cause.",
        "Do you think that we're going to get to the bottom of what has caused this terrible condition for 250,000 or more veterans?",
        "Well, I think the question of cause is two-pronged.",
        "I do think that we're getting at what initially caused the problem, but more importantly, we want to know what biological processes are causing veteran symptoms.",
        "And so we are getting much closer to understanding that, as well, as Dr. Forsythe mentioned.",
        "We see differences in the brain, in the autonomic system, in the immune system, in the endocrine system.",
        "So we are getting very close to understanding biological processes that are causing veterans' symptoms.",
        "But then my ultimate hope, of course, is that we can use that information to identify effective treatments for veterans who are still sick 22 years after the war."
