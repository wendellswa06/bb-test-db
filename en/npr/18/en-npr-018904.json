        "Well, that's right, and I don't think you're going to see President Obama want to go in alone on something like this.",
        "This is - you know, he's made very clear that he believes in multilateral action.",
        "You know, when he talks about Libya, he talks about how it broke the old model by having the Americans play an important role but not the only role, not the even leading role at times in that intervention.",
        "And so the idea of a unilateral action here, while they don't rule it out, it's something they make very clear they're not interested in right now.",
        "Yet there seems to be no expectation that the situation is going to calm down, in fact that it is likely to get worse, if anything, and at some point, events prompt - they run out of control.",
        "Well, they do.",
        "That's what some of the veterans of the 1990s refer to as a Srebrenica moment: Is there a time at which the humanitarian situation becomes so bleak, so profound that it changes the dynamic in a capital like Washington?",
        "It's hard to see that at the moment, in part because again we're also in an election year, and the idea of another military action at this point has domestic consequences, and I'm sure the president would say that's not the determining factor for him, but it's hard to miss the Surround Sound that's back there at that moment.",
        "And there doesn't seem to be much appetite in Washington beyond the White House.",
        "You know, in a lot of these situations, pressure builds on a White House to take action.",
        "There's very little of that kind of pressure here right now.",
        "There's a lot of fatigue with American military engagements abroad, and even Mitt Romney, the Republican running against President Obama, is careful in how far he's willing to say the president should go.",
        "Well, he says they should arm the opposition, but he's very careful to say of course none of those weapons should go to Islamic extremists.",
        "Right, exactly, and of course it's hard to vet people you're giving weapons to once you start giving them to, and that's one of the big concerns that the administration has when they talk about this option of arming the rebels."

        "Well, joining us now is Dennis Ross, who served as special assistant to President Obama and National Security Council senior director for the central region.",
        "He's currently counselor at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, and he joins us by phone from New York City.",
        "And Ambassador Ross, nice to have you back on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Always nice to be with you, thank you, Neal.",
        "And does Peter Baker's description of those biweekly meetings sound familiar?",
        "I think Peter has a very good handle on it.",
        "I think his handle both in terms of I think where the administration is and also the broader political context in which the administration is operating and the policy context, the difference between Syria and Libya are also, I think, very well-stated by him.",
        "Yet, will - there could easily be a point at which you have to do something, no?",
        "The answer is yes, and I would even say one of the things that one has to consider is not only that you're going to have some kind of horrific, galvanizing event, like what happened in the Balkans.",
        "But I think there's even something else to keep in mind.",
        "A lot of what prevents people from thinking about any kind of more active intervention are the fears that if you intervene - at least you hear this argument - if you intervene, you're going to intensify the violence, you're going to make a civil war more likely, you're going to break down central authority within Syria.",
        "Are you going to increase the prospects that al-Qaida will have openings and that a failed state could emerge?",
        "The problem is that all those things are likely to materialize if we stay on the path we're on now, precisely because what's happening, even as we speak, is the violence is becoming more intense, the sectarian divide is becoming so deep that it may not be bridgeable, and as long as Assad is there, this is a trend that is only going to get worse.",
        "And I'm afraid it isn't just the galvanizing event that may take place; the very scenarios or concerns that people have about intervention are, in fact, what may take place if nothing more is done.",
        "Yet intervention also suggests serious problems with two countries that have been supporting Syria thus far in the United Nations, that is Russia and China, both of whose support the United States would like very much in its approach to Iran."

        "There's no question about there.",
        "There is an irony, I would say, by the way.",
        "The Russians, because they're supporting the Syrians right, or certainly are perceived as being protective of the Syrian regime right now, are probably not so keen on looking like they're also prepared to be the protector of Iran at this point.",
        "Again, you have a perception in the Arab world that the Damascus regime is killing Sunnis.",
        "And if suddenly Russia is now seen as protecting the Iranians, as well, it's going to look like the Russians are big on going after those who threaten the Sunnis, and I'm not sure that's where the Russians want to be.",
        "So there's a paradox here.",
        "The position they have on Syria is not likely necessarily to translate into a position where they will change the posture they have on Iran, and ironically, maybe not so ironically, what we've seen is that the Russians have been holding very tightly with us in the Five Plus One negotiations with the Iranians.",
        "Peter Baker, before we let you, you mentioned that Kofi Annan is coming to Washington to meet with Secretary of State Clinton.",
        "Are there any other precipitating events that are scheduled?",
        "Is this just an endless process of consultations and protests to Damascus?",
        "Well, an important date to remember is coming up later this month in Los Cabos, Mexico, it's the G20 meeting on, I think, it's June 18th or 19th, or the 18th and 19th.",
        "And on the sidelines of that meeting, President Obama will have his first meeting with Vladimir Putin since Putin resumed the presidency of Russia.",
        "A lot of tension has been placed on Russia, as you just pointed out, for their role in this, and Ambassador Ross makes a very interesting point about Russia's own positioning in the region.",
        "You know, there's been - there's hope that Russia would be the final, key player in finding an exit for Bashar al-Assad, much as President Saleh was eased out, in effect, in Yemen.",
        "But that's a really - you know, Russia's rhetoric has not lent itself, I think, to a lot of hope that that's going to happen.",
        "I think that's why you saw Secretary Clinton so frustrated in her remarks the other day about Russia.",
        "So they're at a bit of an impasse.",

        "We are the leaders in humanitarian rights in the world, and we must take a stand.",
        "We must enforce humanitarian corridors at least, safe zones along the Jordanian borders, the Turkish borders, Lebanese borders, to provide a safe network for these people trying to flee the violence Assad is imposing on his people.",
        "And we must provide areas for people to defect safely and not have their families be harmed.",
        "At least if we're not going to enforce any kind of military intervention, we must at least provide safe areas for these people to flee to.",
        "It is our duty as, you know, as Americans and defending civil liberties and democracy across the world.",
        "We are the leaders, you know?",
        "Let's see if we can get a response from Dennis Ross.",
        "Well, I certainly understand the impulse.",
        "Again, one has to take a hard look at what you can do.",
        "I am quite sympathetic to the idea of creating a safe haven in the north along the Turkish border, and I would include it into northern Syria.",
        "I think it's worth us beginning to think hard and plan at least what could be such a safe haven.",
        "Turkey could provide a base for such operations.",
        "It would have to be a kind of NATO-led operation, and obviously you have to produce agreement on that.",
        "But it could be something quite akin to what was done in northern Iraq back at the time, during the first Bush administration.",
        "Even this is not simple.",
        "And, you know, to say that you would create such havens elsewhere, you'd have to be operating out of Lebanon, which there's no basis on which to do that, Jordan the same.",
        "That's why at least I focus on the north.",
        "I do think if you had such a safe haven, or at least if it looked like you were very serious about planning it, it could have an impact within Syria.",
        "And one of the things we have to try to do is we have to try to change both what I call the objective and the subjective balance of power within Syria.",
        "Assad has created this image that he's got a kind of insurance policy against any intervention from the outside, and I think the more it becomes clear that the longer this goes on, the less that's going to be the case, that in itself could end up producing a tipping point within Syria."

        "They're paying a price within the region.",

        "They represent 12 percent of the population.",
        "He's created the impression that their survival depends upon 9his survival, and it's just the opposite.",
        "They're put at greater risk because the longer he's there, the less likely, in fact, that there's going to be anything that can protect the Alawis in the long run in Syria.",
        "And I think here, if the Saudis, who are seen as being the main backers of the Sunnis in Syria, were to send messages to key Alawis that they're prepared to offer assurances about what happens in the aftermath of Assad, no bloodbath, no vengeance, but their ability to deliver on such assurances also depends upon accelerating the departure of Assad because anybody's ability to deliver on assurances will disappear over time.",
        "But just get back to Nora's point, a safe zone inside Syria is a form of armed intervention.",
        "Those people would have to be protected by air and by boots on the ground.",
        "There's no doubt about that, if you do what Nora's talking about.",
        "What I'm suggesting is some kind of no-fly, maybe no-drive zone in the north, which could create an area where people could leave and could have safety.",
        "And I do think it has to be something that is considered because I am afraid that if, as I said before, if we simply stay on the same path - there's no doubt that what Nora said, by the way, is not completely fair to President Obama.",
        "He's been very clear about the fact that Assad needs to leave.",
        "And the administration has done a lot to ratchet-up the pressure on this regime and choke off its financial resources, but it's obvious that that's not sufficient.",
        "And that's why the longer things go on, the worse the likelihood and the situation in Syria is going to become."
