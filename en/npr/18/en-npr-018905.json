        "Nora, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you very much for answering my questions.",
        "And this is from Jim(ph) in Portland: Last year when Gadhafi threatened - just threatened to go house-to-house and kill his citizens, the U.S.",
        "and other countries took up arms against him.",
        "Now in Syria, al-Assad is actually killing his citizens, but no country is willing to take up arms against him.",
        "What is the difference?",
        "Yes.",
        "First, let's just be clear, Gadhafi did kill people.",
        "It was - certainly in places like Misrata and elsewhere.",
        "And he had his forces moving on Benghazi, and he declared that he was going to treat all those who were in Benghazi as if they were rats.",
        "Given what he had done in Misrata, it was very clear what he was going to do.",
        "Assad has killed many more people than Gadhafi killed.",
        "What is the difference is that we don't have the same kind of international consensus.",
        "We are being blocked in the Security Council by the Russians principally and the Chinese secondarily.",
        "The Russians in a sense feel that they acquiesced in Libya, and they didn't - and they got an outcome that they didn't bargain for, and now they don't want to see the same thing take place in Syria.",
        "The Arab League was much stronger in the case of Libya than it is in Syria.",
        "It is true that the Syrians have much more military capability and a real army, unlike what one saw in Libya.",
        "And one other point: The fact is that those who joined us in Libya from Europe, they basically used up their capabilities.",
        "We had to - we basically had to provide most of the munitions for them.",
        "So they're not in as good a position militarily even to carry out the same kinds of operations that they carried out in Libya.",
        "So there's a number of differences, to be sure.",
        "The problem is it comes up against the reality of what Assad continues to do, and you have this stalemate where, as I said earlier, everything in Syria is going to become worse and worse over time: the violence, the civil war, the sectarian divide.",
        "If we don't want Syria to become a failed state, we do have to come up with additional means of pressuring Assad so that we tip that balance within Syria, and Assad chooses to leave.",
        "Ambassador Ross, thanks very much for your time today."

        "And thanks to you, and welcome back to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And in an opinion piece you published in the Washington Post on Friday, you said intervention in Syria, not only good policy but also good politics.",
        "Yeah, I did say that.",
        "I think it is good politics for the president.",
        "You know, Dennis argued a moment ago that the president has been very assertive in suggesting that President Assad should step down.",
        "Actually, I don't think that's true.",
        "I think he's been quite reticent.",
        "He came to the discussion quite late, and he has really hung back in discussion and allowed spokesmen and the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, to make the most strong statements about what's going on there.",
        "And at no time has he suggested a way forward.",
        "And I think that's a mistake for him.",
        "Well, the ways forward aren't easy, as Ambassador Ross also pointed out.",
        "You know, the - being president isn't easy, either.",
        "Nobody runs for president because it's easy.",
        "These are difficult choices that face us.",
        "I think that one of the things that is said so often about Syria is true: Syria represents a remarkable confluence of moral and strategic interest.",
        "You know, you caller earlier mentioned the moral imperative, and I couldn't agree more.",
        "But it's not just the moral imperative.",
        "It's not just the people suffering because in fact people do suffer in many, many countries where we cannot hope to intervene militarily or in any other way to make a difference.",
        "But we can't forget that not only is Assad killing his own people, not only did in Hula - they murdered 49 children under 10, but Syria is also Iran's best friend in the Middle East, its most important ally.",
        "And getting rid of Assad will hurt Iran more, I think, than in some cases, many of the sanctions that are in place right now.",
        "So in addition to the moral elements, there are strategic opportunities?",
        "I think that that's right, and I think that, you know, I think that that is obvious to those in the White House who look at this.",
        "The problem is the challenge of what to do and how to avoid being perceived as being mired in a, you know, a, quote, \"\"new Iraq\"\" or another Middle East war.",
        "And I think that there are ways to do that working with Turkey, working with the Arab League, which has been very forward leaning, to try and do the kinds of limited things that would help the opposition, which after all is armed and is taking on the Syrian regime not completely effectively but not ineffectively at this time."

        "That's the problem with the United Nations Security Council.",

        "Well, Syria isn't really a tribal environment like Somalia, and I think that the analogy doesn't quite work.",
        "Where I think the caller makes a fair point is that among those parties that are fighting against Assad are Sunni Muslim extremists, many of them backed by Gulf countries.",
        "And we don't have a great desire to see them empowered nor, by the way, do we have a great desire to see the rest of Syria crushed under the jackbooted heel of Bashar al-Assad.",
        "And so, you know, all the more reason why we have an interest in trying to ensure that they have an organized opposition, that it has a set of principles and a transition plan to live by that protects minorities, that protects other religions - Alawites, as well as Christians and the very few Jews who live in Syria.",
        "Now to speak of the Kurds, you know, there's a lot at stake here.",
