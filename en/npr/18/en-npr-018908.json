        "There are times where someone can be on a street and you're trying to talk to someone, but maybe they're impaired some kind of way and you can't bring them down there, and they react violently.",
        "There's no talking in a calm tone of voice at that point because they're not talking to you that way.",

        "That's how I conduct myself.",
        "Do you think that's part of why there is this so-called trust gap that even, you know, Loretta Lynch, the attorney general, has talked about?",
        "The fact that police departments and the communities they serve, that they're not getting each other, they don't trust each other?",
        "I mean, there's accountability to be had on both sides, whether it be citizens towards us or us toward citizens.",
        "The sooner everyone has accountability for their own actions and it's visible to one another, then you'll start seeing that.",

        "Not to sound cheesy, but if you only show up when shots get fired but not on the other days just to, hey, I'm around, everything good here - I think if the public sees more of that and can understand that we really are there to help, that builds trust as well.",
        "What do your friends and family think about this new move?"
