        "I think it depends.",
        "Certainly, some people like to recreate sort of alone with the machines.",
        "The social scientist Robert Putnam wrote a best-seller a few years back called \"\"Bowling Alone,\"\" you might remember, which suggested this isn't just true of gaming; this is true of recreation more broadly speaking.",
        "We tend to engage in interaction with machines more often, in more isolated recreational activities, and gaming is no exception.",
        "We're seeing machines becoming an increasingly important component of the casino floor.",
        "That's not to say, certainly, that the more people-oriented games aren't important anymore, and certainly this recent poker boom may be an exception to this sort of machinization process.",
        "Well, you've talked about the maverick period, and I guess we all--we watch the movies, so we know a little bit about the Mafia period.",
        "When did the MBAs come into it?",
        "Well, certainly, you can look at the current leadership in a lot of the different major casino companies.",
        "Somebody like Gary Loveman Perez is a former Harvard Business School professor.",
        "Somebody like Steve Wynn is a Wharton grad.",
        "Glen Schaeffer graduated from the Iowa Writers' Workshop.",
        "I think Terry Lanni, who's CEO of MGM Mirage, could have been CEO of anything.",
        "So increasingly we're seeing, with this recent generation, people who, quite frankly, could be operating any business in America.",
        "We're seeing that over at the university level across the street here, where a number of general managers of casinos here locally are coming back to school for master's degrees and PhDs because they see that as a necessary credential to operate tomorrow's casino.",
        "If you have questions about the casinos of today or tomorrow, their design, what they're doing to separate you from whatever's inside your wallet, our number is (800) 989-8255; that's (800) 989-TALK.",
        "Our e-mail address is totn@npr.org.",
        "We're also getting questions from people here in the audience at the Desert Research Institute.",
        "Why don't we begin there.",
        "Hi.",
        "Thanks.",
        "My name is Susan Reynolds and my question is: What sort of impact was there on the Las Vegas community when the casinos changed from family run to corporate run?",
        "That's a good question, and--I'm sorry, this is Bo Bernhard.",
        "That's...",
        "A lot of--when--in being--in thinking academically about Las Vegas, you have to sort of separate myth from reality.",
        "A lot of us think that the sort of family oriented period was perhaps overblown, was more a media creation than it was, in fact, something that was enacted in casino operations up and down the Strip.",
        "But, certainly, in a recent period of expansion--the MGM Grand, for example, when it opened, had a full-fledged theme park in the back yard.",
        "And what's happened is I think we've recognized that our core audience isn't the Disneyland crowd, it's the adult Disneyland crowd, and that, in fact, those are the individuals that we're targeting today.",
        "Let's get a caller on the line, and with us is Kim.",
        "Kim's calling from Ithaca, New York.",
        "Hi.",
        "I had my first trip to Las Vegas a couple years ago, and I didn't do any gambling but I had a great time.",
        "My favorite things were the fountains at the Bellagio, and there's a ride called the Big Shot at the top of the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino, and the Stratosphere is a really tall building already, and then this ride, the Big Shot, just shoots you up even higher up into the air.",
        "And the way the ride is designed, you don't see the thing that you're sitting on, and so you feel like you're a bird.",
        "You really feel like--I mean, you have an eagle's-eye view of Las Vegas and the surrounding area.",
        "It was amazing."

        "Thanks, Kim, very much.",
        "And, Bo, isn't what--Kim talking about sort of the theme park--that was one of the great innovations of Steve Wynn to attract people here for the attractions, not just the gambling.",
        "Sure.",
        "And it's also, I think, a metaphor, more broadly, for what's happening on the Las Vegas Strip.",
        "Every time one of these places opens, it's like opening a new ride at Disneyland.",
        "And it might sound weird for people around the country to hear about this sort of nostalgia, but growing up in this town, every time there was a new megaresort opening, this was a big event.",
        "These were big deals for us.",
        "And so this recent opening of Wynn Las Vegas was something that was very meaningful for all of us.",
        "Well, joining us now is Jan Jones, senior vice president of communications at Harrah's Casino Hotels.",
        "We're hearing about Steve Wynn, who's one model; another is Gary Loveman, the brains behind Harrah's and its great success.",
        "He's less well-known.",
        "Well, less well-known in different circles.",
        "Well...",
        "Gary's sort of a novelty in the gaming industry because it's counterintuitive to expect a Harvard professor to be running a casino.",
        "And an MIT-trained guy who has taken a different approach towards making his casinos a success.",
        "Harrah's--you don't want to say it's a little--not as glitzy as some of the other hotels, let's put it that way.",
        "You know, I think that Harrah's was always gambling-centric, but Gary's approach is customer-service-based.",
        "And if you go back historically, Bill Harrah built his entire business on customer service.",
        "What Gary Loveman has done is take loyalty programs and managing relationships, rewarding your best customers, and really integrated it into the whole philosophy of the gambling experience.",
        "So it's not really different; it's just more exact.",
        "And one of the things he does--I'm afraid there's just a few seconds left in this segment.",
        "But one of the things he does is track every activity that everybody does in the casino."

        "Well, it's interesting; my money is always on Steve.",
        "I think he's perfectly brilliant.",
        "And I think the estimates are that he has to make $3 million a day to service his debt.",
        "I expect he'll make that and more.",
        "How long and whether he's even worried on paying off his debt as his major goal, I don't think, is the question.",
        "I think the question is, will Steve be extraordinarily successful?",
        "And I think the answer to that is yes.",
        "Do you see him as a competitor or as a partner?",
        "Steve's a partner.",
        "Steve--you have to understand.",
        "In 1989, when he envisioned the Mirage, there was nothing that was close.",
        "It was a billion-dollar property and everybody bet that he could not succeed.",
        "It took a million dollars to service his debt then.",
        "And he proved everybody wrong, because he showed the competition people want more.",
        "They want attractions.",
        "They want food.",
        "They want shopping.",
        "He's what drove the change from gaming revenue to non-gaming revenue as the biggest percentage of money coming into the Las Vegas Strip.",
        "So when he brings the level of entertainment to a higher standard, he brings in more tourists and more people that understand that gaming is sport, gaming is fun.",
        "People come to Las Vegas because they have a good time.",
        "They don't come to Las Vegas because they think they're going to strike it rich.",
        "And Steve plays on that emotion and teaches all of us how to better manage our customer relations and better manage our customer experiences, in my opinion.",
        "Bo?",
        "I agree with Jan. I think it'd be difficult to overemphasize the importance of the Mirage opening in 1989, and we've heard the story of how that transformed the Strip into more of a megaresort-oriented street.",
        "But it also changed more broadly what the community aspired to be and what we sort of shot for in terms of what we were selling to the broader population.",
        "And, not coincidentally, that was the point at which Las Vegas really took off in terms of the population and the economy.",
