        "Yes.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I just was curious to know what impact, if any, the widespread casinos, Indian-operated casinos, is having on Las Vegas--if it is having any impact.",
        "The casinos here in and around Tulsa are burgeoning; a 150-room hotel opened up six months ago at Catoosa, Oklahoma, which is a suburb of Tulsa.",
        "An 18-hole golf course is adjacent to it.",
        "Every amenity you can imagine, including the high-end restaurant steakhouses and non-smoking--entire sections of it non-smoking--I just think they have got to be having some impact on Las Vegas.",
        "Rita, you were talking; you couldn't hear the chuckles over the idea of a 150-room hotel, when a 5,000-room one just opened...",
        "No, but that's just Oklahoma with a population...",
        "I understand, but I was just trying to explain to people why they were hearing laughter there.",
        "Bo, are they--it's not just in Oklahoma, of course.",
        "There are big Indian casinos in California, New York--What is it?--gambling of some sort or another is legal in 40 states now?",
        "Forty of the 50 states have some form of legalized gambling.",
        "I want to say to Rita, too, we actually are giving classes right now across the street at UNLV that are beamed to Catoosa for gaming operations management.",
        "Oh.",
        "This still remains sort of a mecca, I think, of gaming education.",
        "But more broadly, a lot of people wondered, when gaming expanded as it did across the United States, is this going to hurt Las Vegas?",
        "And one school of thought was that people were going to be able to go around the corner and gamble, and this would really hurt Las Vegas.",
        "Another school of thought held that this would, in fact, benefit Las Vegas because it would expose more people to gambling.",
        "More people would see how much they could enjoy the gambling activities and, in fact, more people would want to visit the so-called mecca of gambling here in Las Vegas.",
        "The latter theory has, I think, been proven to be true here.",
        "Jan?",
        "You really see that.",
        "Harrah's manages five Indian casinos, and what you find--and a number of riverboats and racinos across the country.",
        "As people are exposed to gambling entertainment, they find they like it.",
        "It's a night out.",
        "And so it doesn't begin to compete.",
        "It builds the market.",
        "I mean, you've seen it when Atlantic City opened.",
        "Everybody said, `This is the end of Las Vegas.",
        "It just grew Las Vegas.",
        "When Mississippi and the Gulf Coast opened, they were worried that that would erode.",
        "The Indian casino in North Carolina--and I find this fascinating--is the number-one tourist destination in all of North Carolina, which is fascinating, but it's because of the experiential aspects, not just because of the gambling.",
        "Business models aside, what does it take to conceive, design and execute today's highly orchestrated casino experience?",
        "Architect Brad Friedmutter should know.",
        "He started working with Steve Wynn.",
        "He's been in the business of designing casinos for 30 years now.",
        "His latest project is the Red Rocks Station, an $800 million casino-resort that's in the work right now."

        "Brad, thanks very much for being with us.",
        "Thank you.",
        "What is it like to have the opportunity to spend $800 million?",
        "Well, it's quite exciting in terms of architecture, and I've been in this, as you pointed out, for many, many years.",
        "And the budgets are extreme, and also the time frame in which they're done is extremely fast.",
        "Projects of comparable size and economics usually take two, three, four, five times as long--many, many years.",
        "This type of money is spent within, usually, a 24- to a 36-month time frame.",
        "Designing a casino has to be really different from building an office building or even a normal hotel.",
        "Yes, quite different.",
        "An office building usually is built by a developer and then leased out to different tenants.",
        "The hotel itself has, generally speaking, a different occupancy in the type of customer that comes to it.",
        "The hotel-casino, with entertainment, with restaurants, with sports and all the related facilities, is quite different because of the integration and complexity between each of the departments.",
        "The hotel caters to customers, as well as its own sales: convention sales, etc. The relationship of all of these things is critical.",
        "The synergy and proximity--you don't want to have things too spread out.",
        "Naturally, when you start to have 3,000- and 4,000-room hotels, it does take on a bit of a trek at times.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And were we right at the beginning when we said everything is calculated, down to the smell?",
        "Yes, but again, it's calculated, but there has to be adjustments, because at the end of the day, it's what the market says, what the market does.",
        "It's totally market-driven.",
        "What you think might work--there's a delicate balance of tried-and-true and working outside the box.",
        "When you start to bring those two things together, there's somewhat of an experimentation, and you have to adjust after the public and your customers start to experience it.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I wonder--one of the, you know, guiding principles we've always heard--and, Jan, you would know about this--about casinos is you don't want--there's no clocks and you don't want to see daylight.",
        "You don't want--no windows to the outside.",
        "You know, that's really sort of the old perception of casinos.",
        "I think if you walk into Bellagio, if you walk into Wynn, if you walk into Mirage, there are a number of outside aspects, because what they learned was, as people are walking up and down the street, you want to incent them to come in, walk through; they don't need to be staying there.",
        "You want them to spend some time.",
        "So that old perception of no doors, no windows--I mean, you can go into Mandalay and you can go to the Four Seasons and never be in a casino.",
        "So it's entirely different today in its design and how they treat the customer."

        "And is it right, Brad, that the casino is just one profit center of a complex?",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "Years ago, everything else was pretty much loss-leader giveaway.",
        "Today, each of the areas, pretty definitely so, is a profit center in and of itself.",
        "However, I don't think you could ever lose sight that the main generator still is the casino customer, and that has to be catered to ultimately.",
        "And I think that's true, but I think you also have to recognize, in a market like Las Vegas, that 65 percent of the revenues today are driven by non-gaming expenditures.",
        "They come from shows; they come from restaurants.",
        "You have The Forum, which is the highest-grossing-per-square-foot shopping center in the world.",

        "But what I don't like is the smoking.",
        "And I wonder if there have been studies done from financial-impact viewpoint regarding the allowance or disallowance of smoking.",
        "And I'll just hear your thoughts off the air, off the phone.",
        "Well, Brad, is smoking going to be part of the casino you're building?",
        "Yes.",
        "At Red Rocks Station, smoking will be part of it.",
        "We pay a lot of attention to the mechanical and air circulation to get rid of that smoke.",
        "We use very expensive, very sophisticated systems designed by engineers.",
        "That cigarette smoke is something you do want to get rid of so that people can smoke, but not bother people next to them.",
        "Let's get a question from the audience here.",
        "Hi.",
        "My name is Lisa Weatherman, and I have a question for Brad.",

        "I would say that since people think of going away for two or three days, which is the average stay--when people think at their job, if you're in Chicago, you're in New York, you're in someplace else, it's wintertime, they would really like to go to the Mediterranean, but they can't.",
        "And I think when you start to talk about trees and water and suntan lotion and pretty people doing pretty things, the Mediterranean comes to mind.",
        "And it's something that people can escape to for a two- or three-day period, and I think it's something that has a commonality amongst design.",
        "I had one more question.",
        "Go ahead, yeah.",
        "Is there a Las Vegas vernacular?",
        "It seems to me like this Mediterranean style is so prevalent, but because Las Vegas is such a unique area, it seems like there would be something more fitting.",
        "Is there a term of art for this kind of architecture?",
        "We would probably have to make one up.",
        "I think it's desert Mediterranean.",

        "As MBA and economists take over casino management, are engineers replacing theater designers?",
        "Well, I don't know that they're replacing it, but traditionally, these shows have been generated by people with theater backgrounds.",
        "And what has happened over the last, really, 20 years now is these shows in general have become so technical that the theater people need some help from people who know something about the technology.",
        "And as a result, we find a lot of companies who have this sort of bifurcated form where they have a theater background as well as engineering.",
        "A theater background as well as engineering.",

        "Yes.",

        "But, boy, the way this has taken form in something like the Ka show at the MGM Grand is just amazing, how we have so many people flying so many different directions, doing so many different things.",
        "And the stage there, how it rotates up vertically and does all kinds of amazing things--these are the kinds of things that the hotels, I think, find very profitable in appealing to our 40 million tourists, roughly, who come from all corners of the world who--maybe a lot of them can't even understand English, but these kinds of shows speak to them very closely.",
        "Yet the competition--I mean, Hollywood movies spending $140 million for special effects; even Broadway theater has got some pretty wow stuff.",
        "The competition out here is pretty amazing.",
