        "And, you know, we were a block off the Strip, and we tried all kinds of things, but we couldn't get anybody to Debbie's show.",
        "And that was pretty much when all the big hotels were opening up and everybody was attracted to the flash and the Treasure Island, the Luxor and all the big ones.",
        "And I was just wondering, the smaller hotels nowadays, do they really have a chance with any entertainment, or is everybody going to the big hotels?",
        "Well, why don't we put that to Bo Bernhard?",
        "I actually just wanted to pointed out that Debbie Reynolds is responsible for perhaps one of the best quotes on the Mafia era of this town when she said that Las Vegas was a much better-run town at that point, and also was found of saying that nobody got killed that didn't deserve killing.",

        "And one wonders, as Wynn Las Vegas certainly demonstrates, that you can spend $3 billion on these sorts of places, whether the new places that will be going up across the street will have to spend that kind of money to compete.",
        "What's interesting about this most recent period of expansion is that it's targeted the high end.",
        "The expansions at the Venetian, at the Mandalay, at Bellagio, they're all going after what is presumably a finite population, which is the upper-end consumer.",

        "That type of design is going to be a crisp, clean, rather desert contemporary look.",
