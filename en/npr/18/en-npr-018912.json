        "I don't consider that a problem, though.",
        "I think that growth is good.",
        "I think that without growth, you stagnate.",
        "And I want to continue the growth as far as the city of Las Vegas is concerned.",
        "It's a different kind of growth than we've experienced in the past.",
        "In the past, we went out, and our natural boundaries are such that you're limited as to how far out you can go.",
        "But there's nothing to limit us from going up, and that's why I'm talking about the Manhattanization process of Las Vegas.",
        "And not just the New York-New York Casino; you're talking about the whole city.",
        "The whole ball of wax, right.",
        "And we see it happening.",
        "When I was elected six years ago, very little was happening in the downtown.",
        "I was concerned because of the 48 out of 50 states having gambling; the Indian reservations, I thought, were a real threat.",
        "And the downtown that I knew when I got here with my wife in 1964 was a gleaming, glistening downtown, and through the years it matured and became a challenge.",
        "And I felt that it's like the core of an apple.",
        "You know, when the core of an apple begins to rot, then the apple rots and the bushel, and it has a reverberating effect.",
        "And it would take it all the way out to the Strip, it would take take it up to the area where the Red Rock is going to be built.",
        "And I made my mind up that we would have to revitalize and have a renaissance in the downtown.",
        "And everybody laughed at me.",
        "They said I was nuts, which, you know, truth is the defense, but there may have been a little bit of truth to the fact that I was talking about things that people weren't ready to accept.",
        "And now they've bought into it, and the downtown has come back.",
        "We have a Furniture Mart that's second to none in the world that's in its infancy.",
        "We're talking about a world-class academic medical center going down there, a performing art center--we're the largest city in North America that does not have one; we have the funding for it now.",
        "We got a wonderful endowment, $50 million, from the Reynolds Foundation.",
        "Talking to major league baseball on a daily basis, talking to the NBA about having the NBA All-Star Game here.",

        "One of the things that we've seen is that the same population growth that is supporting our economic development is, in many ways, overwhelming our civic and social service institutions.",
        "I'd like to hear a little bit about how gaming operations see themselves, and some examples of them being good corporate citizens here in our community.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, we have--well, Bo, why don't you start that.",
        "You study these things.",
        "Yeah, these are legitimate questions.",
        "Certainly, as Las Vegas grows, so too does its need for support of groups like the Nevada Community Foundation.",
        "In fact, I co-authored a study last year sponsored by a grant that the Nevada Community Foundation put together looking at the needs of the overall community.",
        "And one of the conclusions we came to was that giving as a concept is, like a lot of things in Las Vegas, sort of relatively young.",
        "I think, like a lot of things in Las Vegas, we're getting better at it than we used to.",
        "But as Oscar just pointed out, certainly we're seeing different trends that suggest that the future might be bright.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line.",
        "And this is Catherine.",
        "Catherine's with us from Denver, Colorado."

        "And with the influx of folks--8,000 people coming in on a net basis each month--even with that taking place, we've used less water this past year with the growth of population, which is extraordinary because people are educated now in Las Vegas.",
        "They recognize that we live in a desert, and they have to behave as you must when you're living in a desert.",

        "The indoor use of water is circulated.",
        "We get credits, and we don't lose any water as a result of that.",
        "Where you lose water is with the watering of the lawns, not being careful of your sprinklers and that kind of thing, because it's evaporation, it's lost.",
        "That's what we have to take care of ourselves.",
        "We have been very careful about making deals with California and Arizona for water storage, for trade-offs and buying water.",
        "So we're in good shape as far as water's concerned.",
        "I'm not worried about water.",
        "That's one of the reasons that we have the Manhattanization, because when you go up, not everybody has a lawn, not everybody has a pool.",

        "Lung cancer because a lot of people smoke here; it's a kind of community that has a lot of pressure attached to it.",

        "These kids that drop out of school at 16--I think it's shameful.",
