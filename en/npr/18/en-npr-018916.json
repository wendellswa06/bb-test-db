        "What these studies are going to do is swing the pendulum to where it needs to be.",
        "Dr. Jerome Klein of Boston University says the new studies ought to settle the debate.",
        "These studies are about as good as one could get in settling the question.",
        "But Klein says the new research may not persuade doctors who strongly support the wait-and-see approach.",
        "Some worry the result of the new studies will be more antibiotic resistance.",
        "But Hoberman thinks resistance can be limited if doctors are careful to prescribe antibiotics only for children who truly have ear infections.",
        "That means getting a good look at the sick child's eardrum.",
        "If it's bulging outward, he says, that almost always means there's a bacterial infection in the middle ear.",
        "Hoberman says parents can help the doctor make a good diagnosis.",
        "When they are told that your child may have or has an ear infection, it's OK to ask how bulging is the eardrum.",
        "He admits it's not easy for doctors to get a good look at the eardrum of a squirming infant or toddler who's got a painful earache.",
        "But with a couple of people to help hold the child down and then give plenty of hugs, it can be done.",

        "Just a few weeks ago, the Greek politician, Alexis Tsipras, was a young upstart, leading a fractious leftist coalition, but his party, Syriza, could finish first in Sunday's parliamentary election.",
        "Tsipras has vowed to cancel the austerity measures that Greece accepted in exchange for a bailout from its European partners.",
        "The prospect of that has so unnerved the Germans, who are footing much of the bill, that the German edition of the Financial Times today posted an online appeal in Greek.",
        "It called on voters to resist the demagoguery of Tsipras and protect the European Monetary Union.",
        "Joanna Kakissis spoke with Tsipras in Athens and he explained why he thinks his program won't hurt the euro, but actually save it.",
        "The Syriza headquarters is in a weathered old building near a rundown square in central Athens.",
        "Young supporters in sundresses and khakis work the phones and sort campaign flyers in the lobby.",
        "Thirty-seven-year-old Alexis Tsipras, in a purple polo shirt and jeans, sits in a small office.",
        "It's a stifling day and he seems exhausted from the campaign.",
        "His party rose from obscurity to place second in last month's inconclusive parliamentary elections with a simple message - austerity is killing Greece and the eurozone.",

        "This is no coincidence.",
        "The medicine for treating this illness is wrong and it has to change.",
        "Tsipras says the wage, pension and job cuts have slowed down the economy to the point where it's now impossible for Greece to pay off its loans.",
        "He says Greece doesn't need to reduce its public sector, but just to make it much more efficient.",
        "(Through translator) We have to put an end to the pattern of seeing shortages in hospitals but having people in parliamentary and ministerial offices who earn money for doing nothing.",
        "He says he'll roll back wage cuts and taxes on the poor and, instead, crack down on tax evasion and raise taxes on the rich.",
        "But won't higher taxes discourage investment?",
        "(Through translator) For private investment to come to Greece, there needs to be a climate of stability.",
        "The problem isn't how high taxes are, but whether taxes are consistent and don't change every five days.",
        "It has to do with transparency and if there is oversight exchanges and no money passed under the table."

        "We cannot claim we will renegotiate without having a counter-party on the other side.",
        "There's always a counter-party.",
        "And, if the international lenders stop loans because Greece reneges on the current terms, the country could run out of cash as early as next month and that leaves whoever becomes prime minister after Sunday with what may be the worst job in Europe.",

        "Now, a closer look at military spending.",
        "As we heard in Scott's report, the Pentagon has been directed to cut nearly half a trillion dollars from what it had planned to spend over the next 10 years.",
        "NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman now walks us through some of the key features of the president's military budget.",
        "Well, Melissa, the big thing here is that in this budget you're starting to see a strategy shift toward the Pacific and Asia.",
        "And a lot of this has to do with keeping an eye on China's growing military might and its ability to operate farther into the Pacific.",
        "So, the budget says, for example, the U.S.",
        "will continue to maintain eleven aircraft carriers.",
        "They're developing better cruise missiles for subs, sensors and jamming equipment for ships and aircraft and also more money for new Air Force long-range bombers that can be piloted or remotely piloted.",
        "And the other thing is they're working more closely with allies in the region now, in the Pacific area.",
        "Pentagon wants to base a ship at Singapore, for example, and, of course, the Pentagon is going to base nearly 3,000 Marines in the northern part of Australia.",
        "So, that's sort of part of the new strategy shift we're seeing.",
        "And a lot of those, Tom, sound like areas where they'll actually be increasing spending.",
        "Right.",
        "There are two things to remember here.",
        "Overall, the budget is going down for the Pentagon, but there are some areas the Pentagon is spending more or not cutting as much, what it calls high priority programs - aircraft carriers, as I mentioned.",
        "And also, more money on some of the drone aircraft, mostly those that take pictures or surveillance video.",
        "There's a greater investment in cyber warfare, and that would include systems that attack an enemy's computers.",
        "And that's something, by the way, China is spending a lot more money on.",
        "But a natural birth was out of the question.",
        "After all, Tarzan and Jane lived in sin as well as in the jungle.",
        "They never got around to marrying.",

        "(as Jane Parker) Baby's got to have a name.",
        "The Pentagon also calls special operations forces, Green Berets and Navy SEALs, a high priority, $10 billion for them next year, roughly the same amount of money as this year.",
        "But these are the kind of guys that would train Afghan forces.",
        "They're used for raids against the Taliban or terrorist groups, and they're also used in rescue missions.",
        "The SEALs, as you remember, were used to rescue those hostages, recently, in Somalia.",
        "So again, some areas the budget is flat, other areas are actually spending more."

        "But we talked about half a trillion dollars in cuts.",
        "Where are those cuts coming from?",
        "Well, some of the big cuts are coming in ground forces, the Army and Marine Corps will be cut by about 100,000 troops over the coming years.",
        "And since they don't have as many Marines, they're cutting the Marine transport aircraft called the Osprey and also the Air Force cargo planes will be cut by several dozen, because there'll be fewer soldiers to fly around.",
        "And since you're moving more toward an Asia strategy, you'll be reducing Army troops in Europe.",
        "They're going to pull out a couple of brigades there, and that's about 10,000 troops.",
        "And, Tom, troop reduction means big savings overall.",
        "Right.",
        "In any organization or business, everybody knows that the biggest costs are people.",
        "And what's particularly expensive is the health care costs for troops and their families.",
        "So, as a result, the military will eventually save money by cutting those forces.",
        "And the other thing is the health care cost.",
        "They want working age retirees - let's say an Air Force lieutenant colonel, he spent 20 years in the Air Force.",
        "He might be in his mid-40s.",
        "He's now working for a defense contractor.",
        "He's still in that military health care system, but he's got a civilian job.",
        "So, the question is this guy is paying now about one-tenth of what other government employees or civilians would pay for a family health plan.",
        "They're looking at that retiree to pay more in co-pays and deductibles and fees.",
        "The enrollment fee for retiree for military healthcare is about $500 and that could increase four times for the higher-ranking officers in the next five years under this budget plan.",
        "And briefly, Tom, what are the chances of those increases in medical fees that you're talking about actually becoming law?",
        "It's going to be a tough sell because veterans groups, retired officers association, they have a large number in their groups and also powerful allies on Capitol Hill.",
        "Congress has been reluctant to increase fees.",
        "And veterans groups say, hey, listen, many of us has been to war.",
        "We've moved our families every two or three years.",
        "We've endured separations.",
        "Don't compare us to civilians.",
