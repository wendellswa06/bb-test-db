        "As NPR's Mike Shuster reports, Admandinejad has been accused of adopting a deviant position and of trying to circumvent Iran's clerics on religious matters.",
        "The conservative press now refers to Admandinejad and his advisors as the deviant team.",
        "The number of supporters he has within the governing system in Iran is dwindling, says Alireza Nader, an Iran analyst at the RAND Corporation.",
        "There's tension between him and the supreme leader.",
        "He doesn't get along with Parliament.",
        "There's a lot of tension between him and the Guardian Council.",
        "And the head of the Guardian Council was a strong Ahmadinejad supporter.",
        "So he is slowly being squeezed by all the most important players in Iranian politics.",
        "Why all this hostility?",
        "In essence, because Ahmadinejad has challenged Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
        "Ahmadinejad and those around him have sought to portray the president as preeminent in matters of both religion and policy.",
        "He's trying to create new constituencies, says Trita Parsi, the director of the National Iranian American Council.",
        "He's been trying to play the Persian nationalist card, for instance, which is very, very popular in Iran, and particularly among those who despise the Islamic Republic.",
        "Whether he will be successful in that, of course, is a different matter.",
        "But it shows that he is himself aware that he needs to have a stronger platform and constituency in order to be able to continue this effort of his.",
        "At the same time, he has initiated cash payments to many in Iran to ease the economic pain, notes Hossein Askari, an expert on Iran's economy at George Washington University.",
        "Nobody else had the courage to do this.",
        "He jumped on it because I think he saw this as a way to become even more of a populist.",
        "He wanted to target these cash payments to the poor.",
        "All this is designed with a clear political purpose in mind, to put forward his chief of staff, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, as the presidential candidate to succeed him, says Alireza Nader.",
        "This is not a man who is going to give up power easily, and since he can't run for another term, he wants to use Mashaei as basically his proxy.",
        "Hossein Askari agrees."

        "He is trying to make sure that he is the power behind the throne when the two years are up.",
        "But it's a dangerous gambit, and it's brought him into direct conflict with Ayatollah Khamenei, who wields ultimate power in the Islamic Republic.",
        "So far, in all the head-to-head clashes that have taken place recently, Khamenei has come out the winner.",
        "Ahmadinejad effectively conceded that in a recent television interview, where he appeared contrite.",
        "(Foreign language spoken).",
        "But that appearance has done nothing to calm the storm of criticism, notes Trita Parsi.",
        "If you're an Islamic Republic and you have people who may run for president say that Iran is more important than Islam, then that is a fundamental challenge to the very principle the Islamic Republic is resting on.",
        "The battle for control of Iran's government shows no sign of abating.",
        "And as it intensifies, it only seems to weaken Iran further, says Trita Parsi.",
        "There are no good guys in this fight, but there can be a good outcome if this further weakens them and enables the political spectrum in Iran to expand rather than shrink, which is exactly what it's been doing in the last 10 years.",

        "The Senate legislation is similar to a bill passed earlier this month by the House.",
        "The Senate language would increase the amount of federally subsidized loans that's available to each student by another $2,000.",
        "That is meant to save some families from having to turn to private loans.",
        "The legislation would also allow the Department of Education to buy up some student loans made under the Federal Family Education Loan program.",
        "That's supposed to free up some capital so lenders can make new loans.",
        "It may also help persuade some lenders to stay in the student loan business.",
        "Nearly 50 lenders have dropped out, citing tighter credit markets.",
        "Last year Congress also reduced federal subsidies for federally-guaranteed student loans, and some lenders said that made the business uneconomical for them.",
        "The Senate bill would also give students additional grant aid.",
        "The money for the grants is supposed to come from savings made by the legislation.",
        "Many colleges have announced they will replace loan programs with grants to help students avoid mounting debt from loans.",
        "There is little indication that any students are currently being denied loans, but some members of Congress say the legislation is needed to protect students from the same turmoil that has hit the housing industry.",

        "In ancient Greece, there was a well-known 12-note scale.",
        "And what I found is if you imagine Plato's books are a long papyrus scroll, if you lay that out on the floor and then look at the discussions of music and so you just paint those blue so you can see stripes, then you step back, you'll notice that the stripes you've painted, those blue splotches, form a regular pattern: at one-twelfth, two-twelfths, three-twelfths, you'll see passages discussing music.",
        "And the regularity of that pattern was supposed to be noticed by Plato's readers.",
        "So Plato basically inserted discussions on music at specific points deliberately.",
        "Yes.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "Plato, secretly a Pythagorean and thinking mathematics and music was the key to the universe, he used that simple technology of line counting to give his literary works a musical-mathematical structure.",
        "You say Pythagorean, because Pythagoras believed that there was a connection between music and mathematics.",
        "Yes.",
        "That was a fundamental discovery.",
        "Some people say that's the birth of Western science.",
        "The Pythagoreans realized that when we hear beauty in music, when we hear notes harmonizing, that's because the notes have simple ratios like one to two or three to four.",
        "So the beauty of music is direct perception of the mathematical order underlying the world.",
        "They worshipped that mathematics.",
        "Why would Plato try to hide this?",
        "Ah.",
        "Very good reasons for that.",
        "The followers of Pythagoras were a persecuted sect, sometimes violently persecuted.",
        "They were a threat to traditional religion, like many new sects.",

        "Socrates.",

        "Prior to Socrates being executed, a number of other philosophers were banished or fled because of threats to themselves.",
        "It was dangerous in those days to be a philosopher."
