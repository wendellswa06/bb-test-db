        "But the skeletal system seems to be the most sensitive to this, and what we're finding with vitamin D is that it's not one level fits all diseases.",
        "What we're finding is the skeleton needs relatively small amounts of vitamin D to function in somewhat of a normal fashion.",
        "Where, to prevention of cancer, the prevention of heart disease or cardiac - mild cardio infarction or auto immune seemed to be much higher requirements for the prevention of those diseases.",

        "Something is out there pushing the universe, making it expand, making it speed up, and while we don't know what this is really, it's been given a name, dark energy, and you can say that, well, this dark energy is, well, pushing the universe, pushing the acceleration.",
