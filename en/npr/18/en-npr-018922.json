        "Or is there a public good being served?",

        "On the other hand, you know, you don't have to see all the grisliness of a murder victim to know that a murder is terrible and horrible.",
        "And, you know, our standards in this country, while not hard and fast, as you say, are a lot less likely to be bloody than if you were to look at newspapers in particularly Latin America or other parts of the world.",
        "We're going to hear from experts this hour who hold both views, that it should and that it should not have been published.",
        "But David, I want to ask you: Is there any difference when you're talking about what you described as tabloid journalism, something like the New York Post in contrast to the Wall Street Journal or the Financial Times?",
        "Well, I don't think you'd find too many people at the Wall Street Journal or the Financial Times finding a specific instance of violence to be as interesting, unless it's evoking a greater truth.",
        "You know, you could see something that showed the horrors of genocide in the Balkans or Rwanda.",
        "Or you could show a dead body or some sort of atrocity being committed as a way of bringing attention of the world on something that they needed to bear witness to.",
        "You know, ordinary crime is not something that you see - the prestige - broadsheet newspapers giving that kind of coverage to, nor typically the more prestigious, you know, broadcast news outlets.",
        "A tabloid, you know, local news and violence and crime is the texture or the warp and woof of what it does on a daily basis.",
        "And, you know, for them, the controversy is not something to be avoided but courted.",
        "You know, I don't see this as being something where it's a gaffe on their part.",

        "And taking the photo is not - whether this person should have tried to save that person or not, you know, I think it's a no-brainer.",
        "If you can, you try to save someone.",

        "Well in general, you have the decision of the photojournalist to take the photo.",

        "And I'm not going to judge this photographer harshly because I don't know how far he was, and he says he was trying to save the guy's life.",
        "So I'm not going to judge him.",
        "But the decision to publish a disturbing photo like that is a more complicated decision.",
        "And as a publisher, you're asking questions about the journalistic purpose.",
        "When you have an image from a war zone, a famous image that we might compare to this image of this man about to die would be the girl stripping off her clothes after she has been covered in napalm in Vietnam, an image like that causes a lot of harm.",
        "It's an invasion of privacy to the people in the photo, and it's hurtful, harmful to the people who view the photo.",
        "But it has a broader journalistic purpose.",
        "It's meant to reveal something to the audience so that the audience can uphold their Democratic duties.",
        "I'm not sure that this photo in the subway has any broader journalistic purpose.",
        "I've heard some vague descriptions of, you know, being a metaphor for the impending death that we all face, but there's no government to hold accountable.",
        "There's no systemic corruption.",
        "There's no malfeasance that caused this to happen.",

        "People don't want to publish the picture.",

        "I felt sick in my stomach.",
        "I use the subways, I'm a commuter, and I could see myself in that situation.",
        "That to me was the heart of the story.",
        "Why, then, do we choose photography as the medium to censor?",

        "Millions of us have looked over our shoulders as we stand, you know, hearing the train coming on and looking, just wondering who's behind us.",

        "It's about many of us.",
        "It's awful, it's horrific.",
        "The facts of it can't be varnished.",
        "But why censor the photograph?",
        "So at the end of the day, it sounds to me, Stephen and Kelly, as though you use sort of the same measuring stick, which is, does this have news value, does this have journalism value?",
        "But perhaps you just measure this photograph in different ways on that scale.",
        "Kelly?",
        "That's entirely possible.",
        "I tend to think that when something is going to cause harm that those are the moments when, as a journalist, you have to make sure that you have a higher purpose other than just telling a story.",

        "Well, I think that very often what I find is people are making judgments on taste, and I find that a very difficult subject to venture into because we as picture professionals are looking at images, and we judge ourselves qualified to look at these pictures, and somehow we're not damaged by looking at them, but we're making the decision that other people will be damaged if they look at them, and I find that a very arrogant position.",
        "What is it that makes me impervious to the message of this picture which somehow would affect other people?",
        "And I think it's wrong of us to intervene in that way and try and make those judgments for other people, particularly now in this day and age where we are in the Internet age, where the role of that gatekeeper, that patriarchal, I'm going to make this decision for your good about what you're allowed to see, is actually - is fading.",

        "And therefore the discussion becomes one about vilifying the Post rather than picking up the issues that it raises, and there are issues around public safety, mental health, things that we should be talking about.",
        "Why are we spending this time talking about the Post when they've brought in a serious issue to us, to our attention, for discussion?",
        "Well, even before the Post made the decision to publish the photograph, there was the decision to snap the photograph.",

        "What kinds of advice do you offer?",
        "What's the guideline?",
