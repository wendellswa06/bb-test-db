        "Well, I'm a photojournalist in New Jersey, and, you know, I was really shocked when I saw the cover of the Post yesterday.",
        "And, you know, a lot of the comments that your guests are making are very valid.",
        "But on a personal level, I am very sensitive about the people that I photograph, and I have deliberately not taken photos while other colleagues around me have because of the sensitive nature of the situation and putting myself in their shoes and not wanting to be photographed if I were in their shoes in that situation.",
        "And...",
        "Can you give us an example?",
        "For example there was a local story where a mother's daughter had died very tragically, and I was in a situation where it was a very personal moment where - between myself and the mom, and there were other photographers there.",
        "And I decided to step back and not take photos at this one particular time, and other photographers did.",
        "And the long of the short of that story is that later on, that ended up helping me out because the mother came to me and said, you know, I'm glad you didn't take my picture then.",
        "I really appreciate it.",
        "And it ended up opening up the story for me later on, where I was given access by the family when other photographers weren't.",
        "I imagine there must be two conflicting instincts.",
        "As a human, watching someone suffer, you don't want to take a photograph.",
        "But as a photojournalist, when you're hearing all the cameras click around you, part of you must just want to pull the camera up and take the shot.",
        "Absolutely, yeah, that's a huge internal conflict.",
        "You know, thankfully I don't want to have to deal with it on a great level every day, but, you know, it's something that we all as photographers have to make a personal decision on.",
        "But, you know, with this case of the Post, you know, again I can't speak for the photographer, and in many circumstances I agree with, you know, make the picture if you can, and decide whether it's going to be published later on.",
        "But, you know, my other larger issue is the general perception the public has of news photographers, that we're generally lumped into the whole paparazzi umbrella, which is really nothing what we do as photojournalists every day compares to what paparazzi do.",
        "And then in the days following Princess Diana's death, you know, I had somebody get in my face and personally accuse me of killing the princess.",
        "And, you know, these kinds of things, as they build up, and, you know, specifically the Post publishing this picture, you know, is adding to that negative public perception that we as photojournalists have, and it makes my job harder every day.",
        "Well, thanks for the call, Tony."

        "Sure.",
        "You know, Stephen, I'm curious, as Tony raises a question of paparazzi, does it matter that the New York Post is a tabloid, and people expect sensationalism from it?",
        "Well, I think that it is part of the discussion, and I think that the reason why the Post has come under attack like this is because it's the Post.",
        "There's a certain classism I think at work here in the media.",
        "But look, we all play our different parts, and I think that, you know, what the Post has done, you could call it sensational.",
        "By the way, I find the headline very descriptive.",
        "I didn't see any...",
        "The headline, doomed.",
        "Well, that's a fact, you know, and there were no adjectives or inflammatory adverbs.",
        "I mean, it was this man is going to die, he's doomed.",
        "And the Post is playing its part.",
        "It's putting this on the front page, running it big, as it had a huge impact.",
        "We are sitting here talking about it now.",
        "And that's their part in the role.",
        "I think it's up to the rest of us to take any meaning out of that and do stuff with it.",
        "Here we are actually doing something very useful now, by the way, discussing photography.",
        "And I would just say, if I may, that I'm - the encouraging part about this discussion is that it does reassure me that photographs still have power, and those of us in the business, you know, have struggled a lot of times to persuade people that pictures really can tell stories in ways that have greater impact.",
        "And there is no compassion fatigue.",
        "People are moved when they see images like this.",
        "It does contribute to the telling of the story.",
        "And that I find very encouraging.",

        "Hi, welcome to the show.",
        "Hi, how are you doing?",
        "My name is Essdras.",
        "I'm a staff photographer for The Boston Globe.",
        "Back in 2004, 2005, when the Indonesian tsunami happened, I arrived at the scene nine days after the fact.",
        "So a lot of the images that told most of the story had been told.",
        "But I have the luxury of actually being judicious on what photos I took and I didn't.",
        "At some - this specific day, I came out to a mobile hospital, and I found this kid, and the kid, he was about three years old.",
        "His skin had been completely ripped off because he'd been caught in the churning water, and I looked at this kid, and I'm, like, this is so sad.",
        "And I thought to myself: You know, this kid doesn't need this.",
        "I don't need to take this photo to tell the story, and I started walking away.",
        "And I literally was pushed out of the way by a Japanese photographer who saw me, and he followed my gaze, and he went and he got in the kid's face with a wide angle, and he made this photo."

        "I just shook my head, pulled out a telephoto, a long lens, and I made the same photo from afar.",
        "And at that point, a doctor in the hospital screamed at the both of us and kicked us out of there, which I was very happy about.",
        "That was a case where I made the photo, because the photo was going to show up and my bosses are going to say, where is this photo?",
        "I didn't want to take it, but I thought I did it in a more respectful way.",
        "So I'm not judging the guy who took the photo, but I know, on a daily basis, you have to deal with those situations, if that is your job.",
        "Essdras, is there an argument that taking the photo had value in telling those of us who are half a world away what was actually going on there in a stronger way than words would have been able to do?",
        "Well, the thing is, had I gotten there two days after it happened or right after it happened, yes.",
        "It had all the value in the world.",
        "But because it took us so long to get there, it had been nine days after the fact and so many photos have already been shown, that photo, really, to me, was not going to add anything to the impact that the whole story had already caused.",
        "The whole world already knew that hundreds of thousands of people had died.",
        "I don't think this photo would have made much difference.",
        "And the photo exists and the photo never got published, and I use it sometimes when I teach ethics of journalism to say, you know, you've got to make decisions.",
        "And the right decisions are the decisions that you can live with, and that should be your barometer writer.",
        "Thanks for the call, Essdras.",

        "Bye-bye.",
        "And, Kelly McBride of the Poynter Institute, I wonder what you make of his story.",
        "Is this a common conflict for photojournalists in a crisis zone?",
        "Yeah, you know, I find that photojournalists tend to be very, very emotional and gut reactive, that I don't know if it necessarily goes in hand-in-hand with operating with the visual medium.",
        "But one of the things that I would tell a photographer like that is your job is very important, and the images that you take are very important.",
        "You have the privilege of telling stories to the rest of the world, and the choices that you make of which stories you tell can change the course of history.",
        "So I would tell him when you're faced with a situation like that where you have great, great compassion for the suffering individual and you have the opportunity to tell this person's story, look for alternatives that allow - and he did.",
        "He shot with the long lens, rather than getting right into the kid's face.",
        "Look for alternatives that can tell the story in a way that don't make the kid seem gruesome or disfigured in a way that's repulsive.",
        "Look for ways to exercise your compassion.",
        "And most photographers do that every day with the choices that they make.",
        "The more sensitive the story, the more they're looking for different angles, different lenses, different ways to approach the story, so that they can show it and not be that paparazzi, callous person who's just invading someone's privacy in order to make a buck."

        "How often is there disagreement between a photographer who says the world needs to see this and an editor who says, no they don't, or vice versa?",
        "It's hard to classify this disagreement, but it's very often the case that we submit pictures for publication that never appear.",
        "It's very hard, from our position, to know exactly why in every instance.",
        "But we put forward pictures which are disturbing.",
        "And a large part of what we do is trying to make people look at uncomfortable things that - you know, looking at pictures doesn't always need to be pleasurable or - but it, you know, one does need to learn from them, which we discussed already, and that can be difficult.",

        "And while I was there shooting with a long lens, the mother of the child had come out, and was being held back and obviously incredibly distraught.",

        "I photographed him on the stretcher as they loaded him on the ambulance, photographed the mother.",
        "And in the newspaper, we decided to run the photo of the mother being distraught, and not the photo of the child, because at that point, he was already deceased."
