        "…when you think about health care, this is an issue that Senator Hillary Clinton has taken some ownership of well before she was a senator.",
        "Is this something that you think that Senator Clinton can use to her advantage and what did you hear last night?",
        "(French spoken)",
        "She can use that to her advantage.",
        "Listen, she's a brilliant lady, and when it comes down to policy and the issues on, actually, enacting policy, she beats Obama hands down.",
        "Now, I'm not for her plan.",
        "I'm not for the universal health care plan, but you're right.",
        "When she was first lady in the '90s, that was her issue of passion, and it still is.",
        "Now, she wants to have a universal health care mandate.",
        "If people don't sign up for her program if she's a president, they will be fined.",
        "Whereas Obama, he wants federal funding, yes, but he also wants to have the American people to have a choice.",
        "So he also wants partial subsidies to provide for a private plan.",
        "But at the end of the day, last night in the debate, she showed that she had more policy experience, and people are emotional about the war.",
        "But Obama hasn't really come up with a plan on terrorism.",
        "And she, in essence, has stood the test of time.",
        "Jamal, what about money?",
        "There has been a lot of talk about how the Democrats right now are actually in a better financial position than the Republicans speaking of the candidates.",
        "Are both of these candidates equally matched to, basically, put out their message through television?",
        "I mean, Super Tuesday is a time where no matter how many places these folks go, they cannot simultaneously be in over 20 states at once.",
        "And so that means television ads are a big part of this.",
        "Are both of these candidates up for that challenge?",
        "Well, you know, it's interesting.",
        "We don't know what Senator - how much money Senator Clinton has raised lately.",
        "There was a report this week that Senator Obama has now raised $32 million in January alone.",
        "He's on the air in 20 states that are having contests on February 5th and he's going up on the air in 12 more states that are having contests in the first - in the next week or so of February.",
        "So Senator Obama is certainly raising a lot of money.",
        "I would assume Senator Clinton is fine on money.",
        "She also has an advantage on name I.D.",
        "already and on general popularity.",
        "You know, what's funny is there's not a lot of new information to learn about Hillary Clinton.",
        "Democrats and the American public have been, you know, hearing Senator Clinton, Hillary Clinton's name now for 16 years and people feel like they know her.",
        "I think she can remind them.",
        "She can remind them of the good things.",
        "She can make a good impression by putting out some ads.",
        "But she's not going to change some core impressions about herself with a few TV ads.",
        "Obama is in a different position.",
        "A lot of people don't know him.",
        "It's a reason why his poll numbers are just now starting to come up.",
        "So he's actually got to introduce himself to people and counter whatever they may be hearing that's negative in the news media.",
        "Angela, but what about that, you know, having a prior record, so to speak and cut both ways?",
        "And there's - although I've seen some Republicans actually saying that they would vote for Hillary over McCain, and you know…"

        "That whole question of having a track record, does that cut against her in some ways?",
        "I think it actually helps her.",
        "At the end of the day, with the Super Tuesday processes, I think it's going to come down to the Hispanic vote, and Hillary is reaching out to that community.",
        "Now, you had a very strong Hispanic organization that endorsed Obama yesterday regarding the illegal alien process and immigration process.",
        "I think that a track record does count, but I think in this instance, it's going to actually help her.",
        "If you listened to the debate last night, Obama, yes, talked about hope.",
        "Yes, he can unify people.",
        "But at the end of the day, now is going to come down to experience and who will be the best candidate.",

        "And, so, I think to suggest somehow that the problem that we're seeing in inner-city unemployment, for example, is attributable to immigrants, I think, is a case of scapegoating that I do not believe in, I do not subscribe to.",
        "Now, Jamal, do you think that that was a risky position for Senator Obama given especially that Hillary has said that jobs have been lost in the situation?",
        "Well, I don't think it's a risky position over the next two weeks.",
        "We'll see what happens in the fall, it may be a different story.",
        "I think Barack Obama has got a lot of ground to make up with Hispanic and Latino voters and so he is doing what he - and so he is communicating in a way that will appeal to them.",

        "In the delta part of Mississippi, you have a lot of undocumented workers helping rebuild the casinos.",
        "In the delta part of Mississippi, you have a high percentage of unemployed blacks that could do those unskilled labor jobs if those casinos would go into the community and recruit.",
        "Let's look at New York.",
        "You have 45 percent unemployment among black males.",
        "Be - and still, Eliot Spitzer wants to give illegal aliens driver's licenses.",
        "I think that this issue does divide the black community.",
        "And…",
        "Yeah, Angela, I would just…",
        "…when undocumented workers are hired, they do get paid less.",
        "Angela, I don't disagree with you that it's not an important issue in the community and there are people who care about it, I just don't think it's going to be the issue that turns African-American voters away from Senator Obama in this contest.",
        "I, you know, I don't know.",
        "They might go more on the lines of Hillary because I do think that this issue does divide the black and Hispanic community.",
        "And you do have a lot of unemployment in our inner city among black males and undocumented workers have taken those jobs."

        "You know what?",
        "At the end of the day, they need to beat Republicans.",
        "You know, if the Democrats want to do that, then I think that it would be a very powerful ticket.",
        "But in the end, I think, Republicans are going to win.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don't think you'd have an Obama and Clinton ticket.",
        "I mean, I just may be a little politically incorrect here, but I just think that's maybe a little bit too much change for America to handle all at once.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "You can have one candidate of change, but you just can't have two, huh?",
        "It'd be powerful, though.",
