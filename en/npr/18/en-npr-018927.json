        "And he's reacting to footage he's seen on TV - and you may have seen it, too - of absolutely filthy conditions at migrant detention centers in Hungary.",
        "Human rights groups say Hungary is not providing adequate facilities, not enough food and water, not enough sanitation.",
        "But Hungarian state TV, which is allied with the right-wing government, has blamed migrants and refugees for the condition of the camps, cast them as uncivilized with dirty habits.",
        "And that's what this man seems to believe.",
        "Another woman I talked to said, yes, she's heard the pope's call to take in refugees, but she said the pope isn't here.",

        "The Catholic charity Caritas is helping on the Serbian border, but, overall, the church has been absent, at least in official capacity.",
        "And part of that is the controversy you mentioned - the mixed signals coming from church leaders.",
        "Part of it is also the role of churches in Hungary.",
        "This was a communist country for more than forty years.",
        "It's not very religious.",
        "Churches don't play a role in charity the way they do, at least in the United States.",
        "Also, the Catholic church here has been conservative, and many church leaders support the right-wing government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban.",

        "He doesn't use the word refugees.",
        "And some church leaders have done the same.",
        "There are new laws that are supposed to take effect in Hungary this coming week, I understand.",
        "And the very act of being a migrant or helping migrants will be made into a law - criminalized.",
        "Can you tell us about those?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So on Tuesday, new laws go into effect that make it illegal to enter Hungary without a visa.",
        "So migrants from the Middle East or Africa won't be allowed to enter, and if they do - scrambling over a barbed wire fence, say - they'll be arrested.",
        "And that's even if they do intend to ask for asylum.",
        "Now, already it's illegal to house migrants in your home or transport them - so give them up to the border, for example.",
        "And those laws are meant to target smugglers, but they're also discouraging civilians from helping.",
        "So people who would otherwise be charitable and want to help, it makes them think twice because they could be persecuted.",
        "Some say that's what the government here wants.",
        "And for churches, in particular, these laws leave them in a bind because they could risk their nonprofit status if they're prosecuted for aiding and abetting criminals.",

        "military forces from the hostilities in and around Yemen except those operations directed at al-Qaida.",
        "It passed 63-37, which, in this narrowly divided Senate, counts as pretty overwhelming support.",
        "I mean, you just have to look at the lead co-sponsors on the bill.",
        "You've got conservative Mike Lee on the one hand and self-proclaimed democratic socialist Bernie Sanders on the other.",

        "Yeah.",
        "This resolution was voted on in March, and it failed to pass that initial procedural hurdle.",

        "He's a Republican who is a co-sponsor on this legislation.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "And I think the Khashoggi incident has also gotten a lot of people's attention and has perhaps caused a lot of people to wonder why we should so blindly, so willingly, enter into an alliance with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to fight the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen."
