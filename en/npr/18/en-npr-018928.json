        "I hope that this holographic future is not the one, but it certainly could be, and I feel like it would be very isolating.",
        "Well, that was another thing I wanted to ask about because a lot of this book deals with the ways that we remember people who have died, whether it's the graves that we visit or photos that we look at.",
        "And in this slightly futuristic tale, people can create holograms that their loved ones can revisit when they die.",

        "It just becomes more three-dimensional.",
        "Why do you see those as similar?",
        "Well, it's, you know, it's more for the living, the people who are still here, and to re-experience that person in some sense, to conjure them back up, to remember what it was like to be in their presence.",
        "I get - I mean, I get the need for that.",
        "I think it scratches an itch, but the reality is they're still gone.",
        "Have you ever had an encounter with a spirit, do you think?",

        "Yeah, do I think is probably the operative.",
