        "Well, not entirely, but I'll certainly commute between the two campuses and be a sort of in-between figure between medicine and art.",
        "What are some the things you like to do most there?",
        "Tell me.",
        "Well, I'm - the things I like to do most are to see patients, which I was doing this morning, and to write about them, and to talk about them, and to think about them.",
        "Now, you talk about a lot of your patients in this book, and some of them, well, they all have to do with music.",
        "What made you decide to go on this music bender, if I may put…",
        "Well, I mean, apart from sort of personal involvement with music as a physician back in the 1960s, when I saw the patients I later wrote about in \"\"Awakenings\"\" deeply in Parkinsonian patients who couldn't move or speak unless there was music, this was my first glimpse of the therapeutic power of music.",
        "And, subsequently, I saw that in many other conditions, although, often different sorts of music working in different ways.",
        "And I've also been consulted over the years by people with various musical problems…",
        "Right.",
        "…as you've mentioned, from not perceiving it to not being able to stop it or hallucinating it.",
        "But I think the final thing for me is the fact that on the last 10 years, basically, there's been an amazing technological advances so that the functional brain imagery we could can at the brain when people are listening to music, imagining music, composing music, and we have a much clearer idea now of what goes on than we did 10 years ago.",
        "Well, I want to get in to all of that because it's also interesting.",
        "But let me start with the first - one of the major points that you make in your book is that our brains are wired for music the same way we're wired for language.",
        "Well, and even more extensively, there's no particular music center but there are many different parts of the brain, many networks, many systems -in the auditory parts of the brain, the visual parts, the executive parts, the motor parts - and there are like 20 or 30 different parts of the brain which are recruited for musical experience and performance.",
        "And this is much wider than for speech, which is the reason why if people lose language in aphasia, they still have music available.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And you quote Steven Pinker in the foreword of your book, in the preface saying, you know, there's really no biological reason for we, as an animal, to be so - have music such an integral part of ourselves.",
        "Would you agree with that?"

        "No, I think, I disagree rather strongly, although, really, one can only speculate.",
        "But music occurs and is central in every culture we know of, we have known of.",
        "There are musical instruments which go back 50,000 years - bone flutes, which have much the same tonal intervals as we have now.",
        "We have things like - something which is exclusively human and doesn't have an analog, and speech is our movement synchronized with beat, with rhythm.",

        "Right.",

        "This seems to be an exclusively human thing.",
        "And it wouldn't have been preserved - I mean, to invert the argument - if it hadn't been useful.",
        "I mean, Darwin thinks of music in terms of courtship he felt was - had a strong evolutionary sexual selection.",
        "I also wonder about a cultural selection because music is so powerful for bonding people together.",
        "Right.",
        "You say it's not only what - that we appreciate music on an emotional level, but that we have a, quote, \"\"largely unconscious structural appreciation of music.\"\" What do you mean by that?",
        "Well, with experience as with language, I think, as it were the grammar of music or particular music, the rules, the laws, the way it is going, come to one, and so much of listening to music is anticipation.",
        "And one can whistle along sometimes with a piece one has never heard.",
        "You were almost composing it with the composer.",
        "He's hinting all the while as to where it's going.",
        "And if one gets a sudden sense of shock or dissonance that there's a surprise.",
        "You say - you talked about having a musician's brain.",
        "Are the brains of musicians really different than the brains of non-musicians?",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "We're talking with the incomparable Oliver Sacks, author of \"\"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain\"\" just out in hardcover, and I know it has a cover that you hate on, that you hate looking at your own picture, right?",
        "Well, you know - once is enough.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, everyone's brains are different, but the brains of musicians are grossly different.",
        "A man called Schlaug, Gottfried Schlaug at Harvard have shown that various structures in the brain, the corpus callosum, big band between the hemisphere's auditory cortex, motor cortex, visual cortex are all visibly enlarged or so visibly enlarged in musicians that you could look at a brain and say, I think that's a musician's brain, but you couldn't say it's a mathematician's brain or an artist's brain."

        "Well, the music industry originally called it an earworm.",
        "I somehow like the term of a brain worm, which I imagined it boring into the brain, and certainly it goes round and round in the brain.",

        "It tends mostly to occur, not exclusively, mostly in people who are pretty deaf.",
        "And it's as if when the hearing parts of the brain aren't getting their usual input, their usual nourishment, then they dig down into memory and they activate themselves.",
        "So usually, these hallucinations are usually of popular songs, hymns, whatever one has heard in early life.",
