        "But you also talk about how when you recall music, some people just hear instruments, some people can hear a whole orchestra, and that you can recall it as if it were live.",
        "You know, live being played live.",
        "You talk about whether Beethoven or it was Bach who lost his hearing who would have gone nuts if he hadn't been able to do that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I mean, I would think most professional musicians, and especially conductors and composers, you know, could do that.",
        "And when Beethoven lost his hearing or became deaf, whatever - however wretched this made him in other ways, it certainly didn't disable him as a musician.",
        "In fact, it may even have heightened his musical imagery because deafness tends to heighten the sensitivity of the auditory parts of the brain.",
        "And in some people you write about, it can be so strong that they swear there's the radio on or something like that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, then there's a hallucination.",
        "But I don't think Beethoven hallucinated.",
        "I think there may be a sort of continuum between image and hallucination, but they're pretty different.",

        "You know him from all his books in the past.",

        "Also, we're in \"\"Second Life.\"\" You can meet an avatar there and get to know and ask questions and send us a question here also via \"\"Second Life.",
        "Let's talk about something that's really fascinating.",
        "And you talk about it in the book, and I really didn't know about it, that it existed until I read about it in the book.",
        "That's the orthopedic surgeon who was struck by a lightning and had suddenly an onset of musical interest that never he had before.",
        "He never had it before in his life.",
        "No.",
        "He was in his early 40s and really had very little interest in music, apparently not much talent, didn't have a piano in the house.",
        "But about three weeks after he'd been struck, which gave him a cardiac arrest, basically have killed him for a minute.",

        "But about three weeks later over the course of a weekend basically, he got transformed and he developed what you call as an insatiable passion for hearing piano music, then for playing piano music and then for composing piano music.",
        "And he acted on this straight away.",
        "He got a piano, he got a piano teacher.",
        "He continued to work as a surgeon, but he started getting up very early, and all his time was spent with music.",
        "He said his wife wasn't best pleased, and this has continued for 15 years.",
        "Wow.",
        "There's really been a transformation and a slight mystical or exalted feeling which goes with it.",
        "He feels he may have been saved for the specific purpose of delivering this.",
        "He talks - he says he feels he tunes into heaven for his music.",
        "Now, how do you as a scientist explain this?",
        "Well, I asked him and he said, as a doctor, I can't explain.",
        "I think it's spiritual.",
        "And I said, well, fine, but might not anything spiritual have to operate via the nervous system.",
        "So he says, okay.",
        "I would suspect there's been some activation or reorganization of structures around the temporal lobes of the brain, the right temporal lobes, which are especially concerned with musical patterns and sometimes with mystical or religious feelings.",
        "I think something happened there.",
        "Hmm.",
        "You mentioned the tools we have today, the ability to actually image the brain as it's working in helping these things.",
        "Tell us how useful that is to you as someone studying music and neurology.",
        "Well, I think it would be useful here.",
        "Originally, he wasn't inclined to allow any sort of investigation, but he will allow it now, and I think we could actually watch his brain while music is coming to him.",
