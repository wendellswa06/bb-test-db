        "Clive was a - is a gifted musician who had a catastrophic illness, an encephalitis, in 1985, and this caused him to lose his memory for events in his life.",
        "So within a few seconds, memory of things is lost and memory is deleted backwards, so that he's almost lost his - much of his autobiography.",
        "And he's in a sort of terrified, confused state for much of the time, because he doesn't recognize his surroundings.",
        "He feels he's just broken up from a death-like state.",
        "But his memory for music or rather his ability to sing, to perform on the piano or the organ, to conduct a choir, an entire choir or orchestra, is totally spared.",
        "I mean, he remains a marvelous musician at a professional level, although…",
        "Still?",
        "Still.",
        "Although if you ask him, you know, do you know such and such a piece of music, he may not be able to - he'll say no, or he'll say he doesn't know it or he's never heard of Beethoven.",
        "But you start him on something, and it's all there, so basically that the performances and the procedure are all there.",
        "And they're all there because they utilize different forms of memory, forms of memory deep in the brain, in the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, and these are not affected by amnesia.",
        "And they're not affected by Alzheimer's either.",
        "So you're saying that Clive has a seven-second memory is I think…",
        "Yes.",
        "Right.",
        "…gone down or up, or is it still getting bigger?",
        "It's - the latest thing was said to be…",

        "Yeah.",
        "Does he remember having done that when he's finished?",
        "No.",

        "What is it about the brain that it can survive all these injuries that happen to it, but the music is still there?",
        "Well, it's because so many different parts of the brain are recruited for listening to music and remembering music.",
        "And some of them may get damaged, but others are still there.",
        "But also, the brain is very plastic.",
        "And if one part gets damaged, other parts can take over.",

        "Yeah, though I think it's not like a phonograph or, you know, I think that the pitch, the rhythm and all songs, all songs are put in separately, and absolutely one - you may miss one part, but others will fill in.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So you have to be a musician to really study it better?",
