        "Well, on his official Twitter account he has completely rejected this, saying that he remains president and the head of the supreme council of the armed forces.",

        "And his supporters in the streets are calling this a sort of invalid coup d'etat and the death of democracy.",
        "Well, really, it's a mix of absolute celebration on the part of people who have protesting Morsi's rule, saying their life has only worsened under his rule, that they were monopolizing the government and only doing what was best for the brotherhood.",
        "And also, severe mourning amongst supporters of this president, amongst supporters who voted for him in what they thought was a free and fair election and now he's out of power.",
        "Now, remind us how things reached this point.",
        "Mohammed Morsi has been in office for a year.",
        "On Monday, there were millions of protestors on the streets demanding his ouster and, of course, the military is now in charge again.",
        "Well, basically, it began as a drive for petition, saying we want to give Morsi a no-confidence vote from the street and many people dismissed it as something irrelevant.",
        "But on June 30th, millions of people came out to the streets, and almost immediately the military said we side with the people of Egypt and Morsi must solve this or we will put in a roadmap.",
        "And today, they did.",
        "According to aides to this president, he refused to step beside.",
        "He said the only way he would get out of power is if he was completely forced.",
        "And to this moment, he continues to refuse to step aside.",

        "And perhaps nobody is more vulnerable than residents of the tiny village of Newtok.",
        "It's 450 miles west of Anchorage.",
        "There, the Ninglick River is rapidly rising due to ice melt.",
        "And the Yupik Eskimo who live there must leave, and soon.",

        "What's happening there?",
        "Well, that is the biggest and most immediate threat to Newtok, and that is the river is basically stealing the land out from under the village.",
        "Every year, during the storm season, that river can take away 20, 30, up to 300 feet a year in that season, and they - just rips it off the land away from the village in these terrifying storms.",
        "And then the seasons are just totally out of whack.",
        "And if you're a hunter, like Nathan Tom, then that affects your daily life and your living.",
        "So you write in perhaps five years these will be America's first climate refugees because, what, the town surrounded by this river will be underwater?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, the Corps of Army Engineers did a survey.",
        "And according to the projections, the highest point in the village, which is the school, because it sits on pilings, could be underwater by 2017 because so much land is being lost every year.",
        "Every year the storms get worse.",
        "Every year the flooding gets more intense.",
        "And one day the whole area could be underwater.",
        "This is an area of mudflats, you know, when the snow melts.",
        "There's no high point there.",
        "There is nowhere to go for them except to really leave the place entirely.",
        "There are plans to relocate the entire village across the Ninglick River to higher ground about nine miles away.",
        "What's standing in the way of effectuating that?",
        "Money.",
        "Money and the law.",
        "Basically, these people are living well below the sort of average incomes of other Americans, and they're able to live that way because they hunt and fish for what they eat and because they share within the community.",
        "So they can't, all of a sudden, go and build and pay for new houses on the other side."

        "I mean, for example, one of the biggest impediments to getting the money for the people in Newtok is that the federal government and the state governments do not, under the law, recognize climate change as a disaster.",
        "So it's not as if you suffer a drought, you suffer a hurricane, you suffer a tornado and you can apply for disaster relief because climate change moves too slowly to be recognized as a disaster and because you need to move people now before the disaster occurs.",

        "So give me some examples.",
        "What are you doing that's so different from what I assume publishers do, which is find good books and get them out there into the market.",
        "That hasn't changed.",
        "That's always been the way publishers have made money is by selecting books in which there is an interest, and then getting people's attention for those books.",

        "It used to be one book review at the time, a daily review, you know, maybe you get into Time magazine.",
        "Now there's, with the internet, this giant echo chamber.",

        "And you have to ask, well, why does each of those writers choose to go with a major publisher throughout history?",
        "The press love to pick up the story of the writer who sold a book out of the trunk of their car, out of their garage, and then made it into a mainstream publishing deal.",

        "They want someone who can help them take what they've created and get it everywhere.",
        "And the business of publishing has become much more complex.",

        "You're selling them to Costco, to Target, to Wal-Mart, to Urban Outfitters, to this huge, complicated physical book network.",
        "And at the same time, on all the digital retail platforms that are out there.",
        "And that's what the publisher orchestrates.",
        "A publisher, when it's going well, gets that book in the front of the store, on the home page of the website, at the moment that that writer is sitting down with Audie Cornish on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED to talk about her book.",
        "Now, publishing houses, in a way, are like all of the other big media gatekeepers out there.",
        "You know, news organizations, I think we're being questioned about our judgment; whether it's, you know, record companies are being questioned about whether they can really tell us who's going to be the next big thing.",
        "Do you think that this is just part of the breaking down of that wall?",
