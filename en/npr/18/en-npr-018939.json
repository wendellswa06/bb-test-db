        "We are gatekeepers to a certain extent.",
        "But the really, really big gates.",
        "You know, the number of titles that publishers have brought out have exploded over the past couple of decades.",
        "The really interesting change is finding which books you can bring attention to, and how you get people to talk about them, and what can be done to get conversations going through Facebook and Twitter and all these other emerging networks.",
        "And out of the thousands, tens of thousands of books out there, find the ones that you can really bring more readers to.",
        "So, in about two months, you're actually going to move into the CEOs office at Hachette.",
        "And obviously you're probably doing a lot of preparation for that now.",
        "But what's the best advice you've gotten about making that transition, especially for someone like you whose best associated with editing books, you know, rather than running a company?",
        "The best advice I've had is from our CEO in France, Arnaud Nourry who is the chairman of Hachette Livre, who said: Don't try to be your predecessor.",
        "You have this job because of who you are and the skills you have.",
        "You're a publisher, you're an editor, don't try to pretend you have 35 years of experience in supply chain management.",
        "You don't.",
        "That's not why you're here.",
        "Your job is to find the best writers in the world and bring them here, and give them the best publishing experience they can have.",
        "And to me, that's a great charge.",
        "Not to have you do too much analysis.",
        "But do you think that's why you were selected to run Hachette?",
        "Because it seems as though they might want someone who could bring them into the brave new world of digital and eReaders and, you know, money.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "OK, Will.",
        "What's the challenge for next week?",
        "I think there are two aspects to that.",
        "One is I love the business of publishing.",
        "I love - I mean, I've been an editor, an editor-in-chief, and chief publisher.",
        "And in every step, I've learned more about the finances in the business, and where you can make money and where you can save money and how a business grows.",
        "So I'm not a financial naive.",
        "At the same time, this is a moment when the questions that you started this conversation with - can writers publish themselves, should they publish themselves, are publishers necessary - are in the air constantly.",
        "And it is important for Hachette to have the person running the company be someone who answers that question immediately.",
        "Michael, I want to ask you one more question, which I feel like I need to ask anyone who's in the business of reading books at all these days, which is do you read on a digital device?",
        "I read on every kind of surface that you can imagine.",
        "A publisher..."

        "Their loans should have been deferred during military service, but it's not always so tidy when multiple banks hold multiple student loans.",
        "Williamson and Brown got their loans straightened out and moved on with their lives.",
        "But the memory of fighting a war and fighting off creditors left a bad taste.",

        "In the last year, Brown and Williamson have been contacted by hundreds of veterans, each with an average of $42,000 in student loans.",
        "It's a very rosy scenario to say that we can take care of 100 percent of all these individuals on our role and get rid of this mountain of debt.",
        "But the reality is is that that's what they deserve.",
        "They raise money online and solicit from large donors and corporations.",
