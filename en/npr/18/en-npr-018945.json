        "EPA is initiating recycling centers around the country, and many communities are getting active with recycling as well because the mercury is a hazard.",
        "And I gather, Richard, that the mercury accounts for the packaging of the compact fluorescent light bulbs.",
        "That's right.",
        "You get it in this really hard-shell packaging, which is really annoying to get out.",
        "And I was trying to figure out, you know, was that really necessary.",
        "And the answer is yes because, apparently, they do it in order to prevent the bulbs from breaking during shipping, and you'd - because - again, you don't want to get that mercury out into the environment.",

        "Should I send it down my food waste disposal to a waste water treatment plant or let it be turned into a fertilizer?",
        "Should I put it in a garbage truck and send it to a landfill or incinerator?",
        "Should I compost it in my backyard?",
        "Thanks.",
        "Well, I think that - probably composting it in your backyard would be the best option because you might be able to turn it into a little soil carbon and the carbon might stay in the soil.",
        "But the other options aren't too bad either.",
        "There's not much carbon in the banana peel to begin with.",
        "And let's not forget the carbon in the banana started in the atmosphere, the banana plant grabbed it out of the atmosphere and put it in the banana.",
        "So even if you burn it or toss it in the landfill, you know, you can't really go too far wrong with your banana peel disposal.",
        "Well, Richard Harris of NPR and Jennifer Layke of the World Resources Institute, thank you both very much for talking with us today.",
