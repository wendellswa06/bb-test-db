        "And the Pentagon has just released the transcript.",
        "His admission to the 9/11 attacks was the big headline, but he also claimed partial or full responsibility for more than 30 other terror plots and attacks, and also reportedly the beheading of Daniel Pearl."

        "My pleasure.",
        "So the first thing that comes to mind when you hear this is something the 9/11 Commission found in relation to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, which is that he is a guy who kind of has seen himself as a quote \"\"super-terrorist,\"\" and have even heard him referred to as a sort of the Forrest Gump of terrorism.",
        "I mean, how reliable are these admissions from him, you think?",
        "Well, you know, some certainly more than others.",
        "You know, he's always had a flair for self-aggrandizement and self-promotion, I think, better said.",
        "You know, he confessed to being the mastermind of so-called of the 9/11 attacks as far back as spring of 2002 to an Al-Jazeera reporter, and the fact is that was an admission that soon became a cause of little surprise to the United States.",
        "He was the operational commander of that disastrous day.",
        "In terms of so much of the rest of it, though, you know, there are many, many things he cites.",
        "The fact is it's like the CFO of General Motors claiming responsibility for thousands of actions that occur beneath him or her.",
        "So it's hard to know exactly how much he was involved in many of these things.",
        "There are just only so many hours in the day for him to be sort of managing all these different projects.",
        "These confessions, they came during a hearing that a lot of the detainees are getting, the question being, I guess, are these enemy combatants?",
        "And he didn't have a lawyer at this hearing.",
        "He had a personal representative.",
        "And he wasn't allowed to make phone calls to witnesses.",
        "I mean do you think these hearings actually sort of got to the truth of the matter?",
        "Well, you know, it's hard to say what he may be saying differently now than what he was saying in interrogation.",
        "There are certain things I do know he said under interrogation, and frankly under torture, which I think everybody admits to - at least in some way, not the government officially, but folks in the know inside of CIA and elsewhere - is, you know, he did offer some valuable information.",
        "It's difficult to know whether now he's sort of arriving at his media moment a bit.",
        "Lots of these folks have a fairly highly evolved media sense.",
        "They read and watch and troll the Internet, and they Google themselves, if you will, getting a sense of whether they're popping up and, you know, whether they are at the center of discussions in South Asia or America or around the world.",
        "And I think that's one of the things that people will probably find as they get to know more about KSM.",
        "That was the interesting thing looking at the transcript of this hearing - through, you know, broken English and sort of meandering points, you get a sense for a guy who almost seemed at certain terms to be contrite; you know, he said he didn't want kill kids."

        "Right.",
        "You know, he is not an inconsequential character.",
        "He was tapped by al-Qaida and rose up the ranks because he is particularly good at complex organization and in commanding a kind of respect and control from subordinates.",
        "That's not easy.",

        "And KSM was very effective in going from the planning stages, the talk stages, to execution.",
        "But you know, the fact is, is that there are many, many plans in the al-Qaida playbook, and I think that's part of what we're seeing here.",
        "They often take years to come to fruition.",
        "Certainly the 9/11 attacks were planned for years in advance, had been talked about, you know, well into the mid-'90s.",

        "You know, we tend to think in news cycles.",
        "They think in decades or even centuries.",
        "One of the questions a lot of people have had too in terms of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, you know, admitting to these various plans is the question of torture and sort of what he was subjected to.",
        "And if you look at his statement before it's redacted, anyway, you can see him saying that - at least he alleges that some of his statements were made after he was treated pretty roughly.",
        "Do we have a sense for what he was subjected to and if that was kind of outside the bounds of what the military considers acceptable?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, it's certainly outside of the bounds of what the military has since said is acceptable.",
        "At this point in 2003, when we finally picked up KSM, who really was the prize, that was the one we are looking for, you know, we more or less threw everything in the toolkit at him, you know, in terms of deprivations, you know, hot and cold, sleeplessness, some physical abuse.",
        "You know, he was, like a lot of the early captures or captives, a kind of guinea pig in terms of us stretching the boundaries to get what we needed at a time when we felt the clock was ticking.",
        "I think that time has passed a bit now.",
        "But at this juncture, certainly, when KSM got picked up and in the months after his capture, he faced pretty much everything we could come up with.",
