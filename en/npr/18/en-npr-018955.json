        "One of those commissions looked at individual cases of Russian athletes, and they've already disqualified 25 Russian athletes retroactively from the Sochi Games.",
        "And the second commission will look into whether it was an institutional conspiracy, this - whether, in other words, if it was a state-sponsored doping program in Russia.",

        "It's also, I think, important for Americans to realize that to some degree, as Zbigniew Brzezinski has said, neither the Israelis nor Palestinians have shown very much maturity about their own affairs.",
        "They've not come together over a very long period of time, and it's important to move above them in my view.",
        "We've been very much in the weeds and trying to earnestly achieve a peace deal, trying to achieve a balance, trying to reward moderates, and it's just not working.",
