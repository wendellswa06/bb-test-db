        "And you could - you can take it further.",
        "I think, Yitzhak Rabin got, you know, met very tragic consequences for his moving forward and he was not anyone, anyone could accuse of being a left or progressive on these issues.",
        "And I also think Ariel Sharon made a very, very important statement when he was prime minister before his stroke.",
        "He talked to his own constituents, his own right-wing, and said, behind this desk, issues look differently, the world looks differently, and if we want to survive as a great state, we want to maintain our character as a Jewish state and as a democracy, we must move and must extract ourselves from Gaza and other of the occupied territories.",
        "That was Ariel Sharon.",
        "And yet, Mr. Netanyahu, and again, he's...",
        "That's right.",
        "Campaigning on these issues.",
        "Campaign rhetoric is not always the rhetoric one has - what now is the actions one takes as prime minister.",
        "But nevertheless, he seems fairly well-committed to expansion of settlements, which, indeed, a lot people, I think including yourself, see as a toxic problem that is just growing worse and worse and more difficult for the Israelis to unravel.",
        "And they see that eventually any agreement with the Palestinians as having to pull back considerable numbers of Israelis settlements, and it gets harder and harder the more you build.",
        "I absolutely agree.",
        "I think the settlement expansion is the toxic aspect that's undermining the foundation of any possibility of hope here.",
        "So, it raises the question of, when we saw Gaza take place, the Israeli incursion into Gaza, the tit-for-tat between Hamas and Israel and this really horrific exchange, Zbigniew Brzezinski was on one of the local - one of the major TV shows and made a point that really struck home with me, which was, this is tragic, but yet it's all part of a predictable blur of an ongoing set of rejectionism on both sides and the incapability of either the Palestinians or the Israelis to take this matter into their own hands.",
        "A musical.",
        "It isn't in Broadway yet.",
        "It's a musical with John Mellencamp, and…",
        "I would have said that as a joke, that the only thing unconquered was musicals.",
        "But tell me a little bit about it.",
        "And if you look at the history of these negotiations, though there have been times where there was greater engagement and more effective American engagement than others, on the whole, we've maintained a narrative and a fiction that Israel and Palestine had to negotiate this on their own; it wouldn't be done for them.",
        "I think the time has come for Americans to rid themselves of that fiction, and it's easier to do that when you see the flamboyant behaviors that you see both by Hamas and by, possibly, Bibi Netanyahu.",
        "And we should point out that, even though the latest opinion polls in Israel show Kadima and Likud quite close, most observers believe that the right would be in a much better position to form a coalition government; neither Likud nor Kadima will get anywhere close to a majority on their own.",
        "They're both around 30 seats or something like that.",
        "I think that's right.",
        "I think the real story is the surge of Lieberman's party.",
        "He used to be an eccentric on the side and periphery of the secular parties, and he's surged, election after election, to greater and greater strength."

        "And despite the fact that Ehud Barak is the defense minister after a popular war, Labor looks like it's going to get the worst result ever in its history.",
        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "Ehud Barak is an interesting man.",

        "That's right.",
        "He's also the guy more recently who, after the Annapolis process started, ratcheted it up the barriers to mobility for Palestinians by 20 percent higher than they already existed.",
        "To some degree when I was last in Israel and talking both to Livni's and Olmert's top negotiators and others, it was very clear that there was frustration in the cabinet with the way in which Barak was managing his defense portfolio, like he was trying to break their political backs by getting into a more hawkish position.",
        "And ironically, he's really moved himself, frankly, away from his own Labor Party base, which doesn't necessarily support that hawkishness.",
        "We're talking with Steve Clemons, director of American strategy at the New America Foundation and blogger for the Washington Note, about his most recently piece.",
        "It's about Israeli elections tomorrow, where he would think that a Prime Minister Netanyahu of the center-right Likud Party would be a clarifying factor for the Obama administration.",

        "These are vigorously opposed by...",
        "I'll take the call off the phone.",
        "OK, Richard, thanks very much.",
        "These are vigorously opposed, not just by the Bush administration, but by the Obama administration as well.",
        "I think the caller was referring to a segment done by Bob Simon of \"\"60 Minutes.\"\" It was really an outstanding segment, and I recommend that people see it.",
        "Bibi Netanyahu's profile in this is to advocate expansion of the official settlements and further integration of those official settlements into Israel proper, and for unofficial settlements he's tended to turn a blind eye.",
        "What's interesting is, there are some people who say - and Bibi Netanyahu is intimating this himself - that he recognizes when he was prime minister last that he made mistakes, that he was immature, that he didn't do some things as well as he would have.",
        "We may see some changes in the way in which he approaches these issues because they're going to be fragile and they're going to be red-line items, partly for the Obama administration, depending on how he approaches them.",
        "So, without seeing him as prime minister, all we can do is go with what we saw in the past, and that is he's a very pro-settlement-association prime minister and who may, in fact, modify his position and dial that down a little bit, but we don't know yet."

        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "I don't agree with - and I came to the program late, so I think Steve, your guest, that outside parties are going to inflict the decision on Israel or on the Middle East, and you know, on Hamas because if they don't or if those parties aren't in agreement, then anything the outside parties try to - outside people try to do, is kind of worthless.",
        "And this is not the normal negotiation that you have between countries, when one says - you know, Israel has already shown themselves to throw people out of the settlements, which was the right thing to do.",
        "I'm not one of these people - I think it's the absolutely right thing to do.",
        "But when one party says, we don't want you to exist as a nation, you don't belong in this part of the world, I don't see why you - yes, you could bring Hamas to the table, but I don't see how outside parties should raise them to the level of the Israeli government.",
        "Rick, not quite the topic we're on today, but nevertheless, not off completely topic either.",
        "Well, let me just put it in the context.",
        "We often silo parts of the Middle East off from others.",
        "We talked about the Israel-Palestine situation devoid of other regional factors frequently.",
        "I think what's interesting about the approach that President Obama and his team have said they're going to take is it's going to be a look at the synergism between all of these issues.",
        "And in my mind we have a peace deal that was put on the table in 2002 by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia that tries to offer a pathway forward.",
        "It's not perfect, but it's at least an opening play to say.",
        "there are 22 Arab states that we can normalize relations with Israel.",

        "Happy Valentine's Day.",
        "Why is this important and relevant to the Israel-Palestine situation?",
        "For me it's important for the United States because if we don't get Israel loosely on track with Sunni Arab states in the region, you're essentially turning over the entire region to Iran's pretensions.",
        "I'd like - I'd rather not see a war between Iran and the United States, and one way to confront Iran without doing so in a bilateral and a direct and a messy military way is to essentially try to put together a different construct in the broader Middle East.",
        "That's impossible without this Arab peace deal and Israel moving forward.",
        "And that's why I said Israel's leaders have been so remarkably strategically immature about their own interest.",
        "And the last comment I'll make about this is that the United States, somewhat as the security guarantor in part for Israel - imagine it like a levee in New Orleans that is slowly eroding with the perception of U.S.",
        "power, declining in the eyes of many around the world.",
        "It's very important that we begin showing that we can begin achieving the objectives we set out for ourselves and not letting this dissipate because the failure to achieve objectives translates into weakness.",
        "That's what we need to fix.",
        "Rick, thanks very much.",
        "We're talking with Steve Clemons of the New America Foundation.",
        "You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And one good point out from the other side, Steve, that we achieved this by weakening our most important ally in the region, a country which has retreated entirely from Gaza, took the painful step, Ariel Sharon took that painful step removing with great political cost the settlements from Gaza, and that has done the Israelis nothing, and their reward for this is, is to receive rockets on their towns in the southern part of the country."

        "Well, the major critique of Ariel Sharon, though I just praised him, was Ariel Sharon did not negotiate at all with the Palestinians.",

        "So, it - unilateral moves of that sort are not the kind of thing.",
        "Trying to work across the lines with those people and generating a different equilibrium rules of the road, both states will need each other and be interacting with each other from here on out after a Palestinian state is created.",

        "Well, my sense is that if you were that flamboyant, one, my view is that the winner, the party that got the most benefit believe it or not, out of the Israeli incursion into Gaza was Hamas itself.",
        "It's Hamas trying to harass a kind of flamboyant disproportionate action because its political enemies in the region are Fatah, wanting to look - we've now gutted Fatah's legitimacy in the eyes of Palestinians, and now Hamas is on the pedestal in the eyes of many Palestinians who hate the occupation of their territory.",

        "But now, with the failure over and over and over again to achieve a different balance, the consequences to the United States are now becoming dramatic enough.",
