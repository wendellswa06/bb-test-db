        "She's a very, very good writer herself.",
        "And she's written something called \"\"The Dark Tower Concordance\"\" which has everything in it you can possibly imagine.",

        "Yeah.",

        "And now, it's more Western-styled.",

        "I was wondering if you had any input on that or…",
        "Well, one of the things about the books that was so wonderful was that there were seven volumes from \"\"The Dark Tower\"\" and we were able to use a number of different artists.",
        "My only request was that they would come back and use Michael Whelan, the artist Michael Whelan, to do the last book because he did the first book.",
        "And whether or not any of that art had an effect on Jae Lee I can't say.",
        "I know what you're talking about, and I think that it's kind of a natural progression.",

        "Does it seem like a whole different world sometimes or does it immediately seem familiar to you because they're drawing it the way you wrote it?",
        "It usually feels completely familiar and strange - a little bit strange at the same time.",
        "It's the same thing as movies where it seems like somebody comes into your head and starts picking things out that were just, you know, mental pictures in your mind, and all of a sudden they're real in the world.",
        "And in some cases with \"\"The Dark Tower\"\" comic book, there are things that I like very, very much that are much fuller and more fleshed out than what I had imagined.",
        "Like the character of Jonas who looks a little bit like one of those Italian Western bad guys.",
        "Or there's a witch, Rhea of the Coos, who looks like every witch that you were ever afraid of when you were a kid.",
        "I just love her.",

        "Hi.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I was wondering if, you know, at the beginning of the graphic novel series it seemed kind of dark, most of the faces were obscured, a lot of the main characters seemed to be kind of obscured, and a lot are shadowy, I know that's kind of Jae Lee's style.",
        "But I was wondering if it kind of added the mystery and, you know, if you think that it helped readers adapt a comic book format who might have read the novel format."
