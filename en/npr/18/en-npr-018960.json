        "Thank you.",

        "It's the pre-war Russian name of a town that was renamed Dzerzhinsk and it's about 20 miles southwest of Minsk, the capital of Belarus.",
        "Then part of the Soviet Union.",

        "And in the end, we found it was the name generally of an extended Jewish-Belarusian family.",
        "And that it possibly was the name of my father's best friend as he was - when he was a very small child in the village of Koidanov.",
        "And Koidanov is the village where, at least record show, there was a massacre similar to the one your father witnessed."

        "There's an extraordinary moment in the book where he says he - this must be a memory, he can't imagine what it was - could otherwise been, but he remembers looking and seeing other people from the village looking on as the massacre happened, as the Jews were shot and bayoneted to death, looking on as if this was just a sporting contest.",

        "He survived.",

        "And he survived by all accounts until May, June of 1942 alone.",
        "Survived in part through the, I guess, unintended generosity of a dead soldier who provided him with socks and boots and an overcoat.",

        "Oversized boots tied around his thin ankles.",

        "And he continued on his foraging until the climate changed and warmed.",
        "And then he was captured, turned over to a Latvian police unit who, in fact, were people carrying out executions of Jews.",

        "M.",
        "KURZEM: That's right.",
        "He was passed by - I don't know what word to use -a woodsman who suspected that he was Jewish - my father was Jewish - and took him to a schoolyard where some Jews, or (unintelligible) as soldiers often called them, were being rounded up to be shot.",
