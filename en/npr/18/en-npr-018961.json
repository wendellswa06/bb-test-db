        "A.",
        "KURZEM: Well, when I left the continent Europe for Australia in end of '49, I made up my mind that that part of my life was a black spot, and I said forget it.",

        "Mr.",
        "A.",
        "KURZEM: Yes.",
        "That's right.",
        "They changed uniforms quite frequently.",
        "And whatever the adult soldiers got their uniforms, I got a little new one made for me, too.",
        "Did you think of - you were a young boy at the time, it's impossible, I guess, to ask this question - but did you think of what was going on, of the terrible symbolism of that?",
        "Mr.",
        "A.",
        "KURZEM: I really didn't understand it fully.",
        "I knew there was a war on.",
        "I didn't understand who was fighting whom and what it was all about.",
        "No one told me.",
        "And at that age, unless someone tells you what's happening, it's hard for you to guess it all.",

        "Of course, you could do nothing, you couldn't do much about it, you were just a little boy at the time.",
        "Nevertheless, you repeatedly tell your son Mark in the book that you feel - felt guilty.",
        "Guilty because, at one point, the soldiers used you to lure young women toward them - women who later end up being raped.",

        "Let's see if we can get some listeners on the line to ask you some questions.",
        "Our guests are Alex Kurzem, who you just heard, and his son Mark Kurzem, who's the author of the new book, \"\"The Mascot: Unraveling the Mystery of My Jewish Father's Nazi Boyhood.\"\" Our number is 800-989-8255.",

        "Thank you for having me.",
        "I know this is a very personal and painful question, but I was led to believe that it was so dangerous for young children because - especially boys, they couldn't hide that they were circumcised.",

        "Only one man knew and he told me to keep it a secret.",
        "And I knew that if they unraveled my secret, I would be dead.",
        "So that played on my mind all the years I was with the soldiers.",
        "And everywhere afterwards, I had to hide my Jewishness all the time, which was hard to do sometimes.",
        "There are descriptions in the book of scenes where one of the soldiers -not Sergeant Kulis who knew, but one of the other soldiers is trying to make you take a bath and you struggled to hold on to your underwear.",
        "And again, the same thing when your new adopted sister being very nice trying to give you a bath and you, too, hold on to your pants."
