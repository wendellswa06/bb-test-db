        "Well, that day may not be too far off because some physicists and electrical engineers at MIT have just announced that they can light up a 60-watt lightbulb from seven feet away.",
        "And what's amazing about this?",
        "They don't use any wires.",
        "There are no wires connected to the bulb.",
        "They use magnets.",
        "How does that happen?",
        "Well, here to talk it is Andre Kurs, graduate student in the Department of Physics at MIT.",
        "He was part of that team that lit up the bulb, fulfilling a dream of transmitting power via thin air made famous by Nikola Tesla, of course.",
        "And he's here to tell us how he did that.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Did I describe that little eureka moment?",
        "Yeah, that's pretty much how it all started with, you know, one of the professors in the group, Marin Soljacic, and that was exactly how it worked, you know.",
        "Four years ago, he - there was a particular month where he would forget to charge his cell phone when he got home from work, and it was one of those old cell phones that, even if you set it on silent, it would still beep if...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "...that needed to be recharged.",
        "So, you know, he was staring at it, and I guess, in his kitchen, very frustrated at the whole thing and, you know, he wondered to himself if it would be possible to just get the thing to recharge itself automatically.",
        "And so he was working on slightly different stuff at the time, more like photonics and optoelectronics, and he started playing with few ideas.",
        "And overtime, it evolved and converged on what we currently have.",
        "Now, I mentioned Tesla.",
        "He tried to talk about that, right, you know, a hundred years ago, in...",
        "Right.",
        "...transmitting electricity over the air through the airwaves.",
        "Did you -were you motivated by him or his kind of research, and did you do the same kinds of ideas he had, or did you have to have come up with something new?"

        "Well, of course, I mean, Tesla did a lot of pioneering work on many things, and it's kind of hard to do research in electronics these days without bumping to something that he, you know, did some early work on.",
        "But - we actually - we were made aware of his work relatively late in our project, and you know, he used resonance, of course.",
        "And we used resonance as well, but -essentially, what we do is that we operate into a so-called strong-coupling regime.",
        "Well, wait a minute.",
        "We have to talk about...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Oh, Tesla, well of course...",
        "Well, no. Let's talk about resonance, and how you do it, to a lay audience.",
        "It's going to be, you know - tell us what you do.",
        "What was the breakthrough or what was the advance that you have done that no one has done before?",
        "Well, it's - actually, it's a fairly well-known concept in atomic physics, in optoelectronics, that if you have these self-resonating objects and they interact with each other - if you can get them to exchange energy between themselves faster than they dissipate energy because of resistive losses and a little bit of radiation, then you can actually get, you know, them to transfer power efficiently.",
        "Well, I have - I'm sitting here in the radio and I'm having - I have radio waves coming into my radio.",
        "Why can't I have that, the radio waves, come in and power my radio?",
        "They actually - well, they do a little.",
        "I mean, radio transmission is a sort of power transfer...",
        "Right.",
        "...albeit at very low levels.",
        "And it doesn't play resonance.",
        "That's how your receiver tunes to the radio station you want.",
        "So - well, the key is that not only do you need resonance, but you also need to adjust the properties of the system, say, the geometrical properties, the materials, the frequency you're operating at, so that your in the strong-coupling regime."

        "When you say resonance, give us - is there an example in everyday life we can look at?",
        "Yeah.",
        "There's - for example, you know, a child that's, you know, playing on the swing.",
        "And if the child moves her legs too fast or too slow, then the swing is not going to go very fast.",
        "If she swings at just the right frequency then, you know, it will go quite far.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You have to kick right at that right point or else you're not going to get up on - the swing up in the air.",
        "And that's - that means you two are in resonance.",
        "And you're saying that your device creates a transmitter of the power in resonance with a receiver and you can transmit then the power efficiently?",
        "Well, we actually - we did play with several geometries and - I mean, they are not - we didn't publish most of what we did.",
        "But, you know, there are several ways you can do it and some of them are a little more creative than others, but none of them are very, you know, exotic, let's say.",
        "You don't need any expensive materials or anything like that.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And how far - you transmitted the power, what?",
        "About six, seven feet to light up the light bulb?",
