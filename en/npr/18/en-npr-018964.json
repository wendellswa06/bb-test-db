        "That's right.",
        "I mean, basically, each object is resonated, so you got these fields that are going in and out.",
        "And ordinarily, if you weren't in the strong-coupling regime, because the intersection of the field of one object that goes through to the other, which determines, sort of, the interaction strength is so small, you wouldn't get efficient power transfer.",
        "But if we get the one object to excite the other in just the right way by operating this strong-coupling regime, then it can actually get efficient power transfer.",
        "Yeah.",

        "And I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "I think we should.",
        "It's an interesting - two ideas.",
        "First, the wildlife question, where we're talking about the biological effects, you're not familiar with yet.",
        "But secondly, let's say you have electric cars.",
        "And as standing at a stoplight, maybe there's a coupling device that gives them a little charge.",
        "Would that work?",
        "It's possible, you know.",
        "Certainly.",
        "But that's further out in the future.",
        "We can do a few hundreds of watts with what we currently have.",
        "And, you know, it could be extended.",
        "But to power a car, you'd need higher levels of power and also, I mean, there's more - there would be a lot of change in infrastructure involved, right?",
        "You'd have to turn up all these roads.",
        "So, perhaps, one day in the future.",
        "But right now, we're focusing on other things.",
        "Now, your research is funded in part by MIT's Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies, which is funded by the U.S.",
        "Army, correct?",
        "Does that mean that soldiers are going to be using this method first, or the technology that you're working on first, do you think?",
        "Well, it's possible.",
        "I mean, I'm sure that the Army will find some application for this.",
        "It's funded by the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies because one of the professors in our group, John Joannopoulos, became director of the ISN one year ago.",
        "And so, part of his grant was used to fund this project.",
        "Does this also mean that you're using nanotechnology in your devices?"

        "Well, not actually.",
        "I mean, we have some ideas along those lines, but not right now.",

        "And since I'm...",
        "How big is the coil now?",
        "Well, actually they're both the same size because, you know, just for simplicity.",
        "It was, just a lab experiment - let's say 12 inches in radius.",
        "Right.",
        "So, you know, they're kind of big and - but, you know, we can make, at least one them smaller so it can fit inside the devices.",
        "And we're also, of course, looking at safety regulations because, of course, lots of people are contacting us, you know, asking about safety implications.",
        "So, of course, we need to analyze that very carefully.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And so, you want to shrink down the size of the coils, both receiver and transmitter, so that they could sit on a desk next to each other?",
        "Yes, something along those lines.",
        "Or, were they just have to be in the same room together because, you know, if you have to put it next to a device, might as well plug it in."
