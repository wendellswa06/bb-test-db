        "And what's this latest problem seem to be, with putting the government together?",
        "In a way it's the same old problem, Scott: who gets which ministries, how to divvy up those important cabinet portfolios.",
        "A week ago, President Robert Mugabe gave most of the key jobs to his own allies.",

        "But whether it will resolve the issue of this power sharing cabinet is another thing altogether, because it's the Zimbabweans who have to agree that.",
        "Ofeibea, you know, we've talked about a disagreement over power sharing, but help us understand what it's like to live in Zimbabwe at the moment with an 80 percent unemployment rate and an inflation rate that can scarcely be imagined?",
        "Many hells, Scott, if you're the average Zimbabwean.",

        "Well, I think a couple of things.",

        "In the last 10 years, the amount of the average student loan debt has grown from about $12,000 to - today the average being a little over $19,000 is what a college graduate can expect to leave the campus gates with.",
        "And just to put that into perspective, that's about a $220 monthly payment over the next 10 years of that person's life.",

        "In fact, the overwhelming majority of students work, and half of them are now working - half of full-time college students are working more than 25 hours a week, which is one of the reasons why it now takes about six years to get a bachelor's degree.",
        "But between working, working during school, working during summers, you know, a generation ago, you could work a full-time job during the summer and be set in terms of being able to pay for a year of college.",

        "Absolutely, and it affects - the effects can be rather immediate.",
        "One is that the rise of student loan debt often now begets more debt.",

        "And so what find is that there's a lot credit card debt that happens during the 25 to 34-year-old age group as well, because the car breaks down, they need to go to the doctor.",
