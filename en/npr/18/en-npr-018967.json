        "But I will tell you that surveys done of people who are in the process of paying back their student loans, after they've been paying back the student loans for about - for several years, three, four years, they actually say that it's more burdensome - more of a burden to them at that point than it was when they first started making those payments.",
        "And I think what happens is fatigue sets in, you know, and it's sort of like buying a new car.",
        "You know, as soon as the new-car smell wears off, so does the joy of kind of owning and paying for the car, and the same goes with student loans.",
        "The further and further you get away from actually having that sort of sheepskin in hand and celebrating that you accomplished getting a college degree, you know, you're on year three of 10 years of student loan payments, and it starts to become less and less apparent and feels more burdensome to still be paying down this debt.",

        "Well, thank you.",

        "So I wouldn't be in any hurry, frankly, to pay off my student loans unless, as I said, you really overdid it and you're looking at six-figure debts and a five-figure income.",

        "Now they follow you for life.",
        "The Department of Education has enormous powers to collect, to garnish your wages to get their money back, and you can't discharge student loans typically in bankruptcy court.",
        "So this is an albatross you could carry for the rest of your life.",
        "And I want to bring Tamara in on this as well, but aren't you sort of caught if, like a typical person, you have your credit card debt and your student loan debt.",
        "I mean that's the Scylla and Charybdis of modern finance for 20-somethings isn't it?",
        "Well it is, and I want to underscore and point that student loan debt is an investment.",
        "That being said, we know that we have real affordability issues, and not only is it problematic that we have someone who's 27 taking out $35,000 in student loans to get a bachelor's degree, but behind that person is a lot of really smart kids from low-income backgrounds that can't afford to go to college and are afraid to take on that debt as a first generation college student.",

        "And if you are spending more than, say, 25 percent of your gross on housing expenses, you're spending more than 10 percent of your income on student loan payments, you'll probably overdose.",
        "I generally tell people that if they're getting student loans, try to limit the total amount to no more than you expect to make in your first year out of school.",
        "So if you expect to earn $40,000, that should be your total borrowing."
