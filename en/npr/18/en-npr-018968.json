        "I'm actually not so worried about that.",
        "You now.",
        "His student loan debt right now is 20,000, which is fairly manageable.",
        "But he says all of his income is going to bills, which tells me there's something else going on -there's a too-big car payment, there's credit card debt, there's other debt he probably should take care of before he even thinks about going back to school again.",
        "All right.",

        "I'm a social worker, have been out of grad school for almost 10 years, and I have about the exact same amount of - I came out with the same amount of student loan debt that you gave the example in for the social work.",
        "I have a master's degree.",
        "And looking back I feel really disappointed in the lack of guidance in college or anywhere else in making those kinds of decisions.",
        "And I kind of regret my decisions, actually, if I'd seen what the career has to offer and just financially making those student loans debts and the income that I‘m able to make with that degree.",
        "And obviously you made those choices with your eyes open, knowing that society, you know, may have made the unfortunate decision not to value social work as much as it does, for example, doctors but…",
        "Of course, and that's very disappointing too.",
        "And I work in a hospital, so I see that all the time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, nevertheless, that's what you wanted to do.",
        "It's what I wanted to do.",
        "I was very young and naïve.",
        "I went straight from high school and got my - and then to undergraduate, and then straight on to grad school.",
        "And I was naïve and just felt like I would feel very rewarded by doing something that I felt like was helping people and, you know, money wouldn't matter.",
        "And I also had a naïve idea that if I went and got a graduate degree that certainly the money would follow.",

        "One of the things that happens is today's young people after they - if they're lucky enough, you know, we have to remember that only about 30 percent of young people have bachelor's degrees.",
        "You know.",
        "The majority of young people and the majority of the people in this country do not attain a college degree, and many of them have student loan debt but no diploma.",
        "Anyway, there are just so much pressures to keep going on and getting more education, and unfortunately the way to finance your education today is through debts.",
        "And I don't think we're sending the right signals to young people when they feel like their choice is to leave with student loan debt right after undergrad and scrape by in a job that's not going to pay very much, or stay in school and take on a lot of debt not knowing exactly what their earnings trajectory is going to be like when they finally get those advanced degrees.",
        "Monica, obviously one of the ways out of your plight is to go back to school and earn a degree in something else.",
        "And you know, I've looked into several options with that but, you know, it's really difficult when you have children and family responsibilities at that point.",
        "So, yeah, you feel kind of stuck once you get to a certain point.",
        "Well, good luck.",

        "We do make choices that lead us there.",
        "But we also have to understand that the amount of credit available has exploded in the last generation.",

        "We do need to be teaching kids about how much debt they should be taking on, how much they should be spending on certain things.",
        "Because the, you know, the first impulse when you get out of college is to go for the best department you can, to finally get some wheels that don't, you know, rattle and fall apart, to really make up for the time that you spent being a poor college student, when the best solution really is to continue living like a broke college student for a few years.",
