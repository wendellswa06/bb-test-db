        "But recently I left a high paying career as biotech to teach college.",
        "And I got involved with a for-profit college industry.",
        "I actually had never made much of a distinction about this before.",
        "And what I found - and actually after choosing to leave it as well and doing some research on it - it's a really rapidly growing industry.",
        "It approaches education like a business and the problem is although some students really do get a good education for their top dollar premium that they're paying for it, you know, each student's dollar is just as green as the next.",
        "And they'll take that money from anyone that can pay for it whether or not they really belong in the program and whether or not they're really getting the education that they're promised.",

        "We have nobody on to defend the current for-profit university industry, but Liz Pulliam Weston, again yes there are people who will make a buck but isn't it an individual's responsibility to investigate and find out what's going on?",
        "It is, but we're talking about people -",
        "Well, this is where I feel like the students were - the naïve students were being exploited because the promises are made.",
        "I mean here we're talking about students - and I'm not exaggerating - who can't add and subtract, who can't read, who are being granted admissions to these $100,000 programs.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Let's give Liz Pulliam Weston a chance to talk.",
        "Yeah, there's an ongoing issue and it has been for a long time with vocational and trade schools and, you know, for-profit schools, either not delivering, not screening the students adequately.",
        "Some of these programs are just fine.",
        "Others are like Melissa described.",
        "They, you know, they're basically diploma mills or debt mills.",
        "And it's really scary, because, again, we're talking about kids that are too young to have much financial acumen or experience, parents who often have even less or don't know how to cope with today's realities of what school costs and how to look into an education to see if it's worthwhile.",
        "And I don't know what the solution is to it.",
        "I do think, again, that we need to take responsibility for our own choices, but we are talking about 18 and 19-year-olds, you know.",
        "And I don't know what the last time you talked to one, but, you know, maybe their world experience isn't up to the task."
