        "Why bother storing music on an MP3 player when you can listen instantly to millions of songs over any phone, computer, tablet, car, TV, or any other device that's connected to the Internet?",
        "Rather than buying songs for 99 cents and downloading them and managing them and moving them between your devices, you just log in from anything and your music's right there.",
        "Eliot Van Buskirk is a blogger for Wired.com.",
        "Ever since Apple bought the music streaming company Lala last year, Van Buskirk and others figured it was only a matter of time before Apple switched from selling individual downloads to offering access to a stream of music over the Internet - a so-called cloud-based music service."
