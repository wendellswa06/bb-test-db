        "The health insurance program for seniors was about to cut the payments it makes to doctors, but Congress has restored the full payments and lawmakers overrode a presidential veto to do it.",
        "NPR's Julie Rovner reports.",
        "If you wanted a demonstration of why the Medicare bill is now law, it was best to look not at the House or the Senate floor yesterday, but rather at a ground-floor hearing room in the Dickerson Senate office building.",
        "It was filled with exuberant members of the AARP sporting red t-shirts and chanting for their cause.",
        "(Soundbite of chanting)",
        "Among those addressing the rally was Kansas Republican Senator Pat Roberts, who voted for the Medicare bill last month when it failed to pass by a single vote.",
        "He noted that 3,000 Kansans had written him in favor of the bill.",
        "And their sisters and their brothers and their cousins and their uncles and their aunts and their dog called me about this issue.",
        "Roberts is up for reelection and he clearly heard the threats of doctors who said that if the 10.6 percent cut in Medicare payments were to be implemented for real, they'd have no choice but to stop taking new Medicare patients.",
        "West Virginia Democratic Senator J.",

        "President Bush cited a long list of concerns in his veto message, but clearly his biggest problem was trimming payments to private insurance companies that participate in Medicare.",
        "Republicans like Arizona Senator Jon Kyl accused the Democrats of targeting the insurers to force Republicans to choose between two political allies."

        "None of the Republicans ever opposed providing the physicians their update.",
        "What it had to do mostly with was an attempt to undercut the private insurance part of Medicare that many on the other side of the aisle have never liked.",
        "And it's one of the signature achievements of the Bush administration and it's no wonder that the president vetoed the bill.",
        "Democrats like Texas Congressman Lloyd Doggett didn't deny that they were out to reduce to what budget analysts have said are overpayments to Medicare private insurance plans.",
        "Even Medicare's own actuary reports absolutely zero quantifiable savings have occurred through private Medicare and will never occur through private Medicare as currently set up.",
        "A waste of $150 billion bestowed on the insurers.",
        "That's the waste that President Bush is so intent on protecting through this veto.",
        "She says one reason the report caused a splash is that it focused on the abnormal tangles in Alzheimer's brains.",
        "Forceps.",
        "But in the end, the sheer political power of doctors and patients trumped even the power of the insurance industry, and it showcased just how weak the lame duck President Bush has become.",
        "Normally, the President picks up votes on a veto override, but yesterday another two dozens Republicans jumped ship and voted with the unanimous House Democrats, producing a lopsided 383-41 total.",
        "In the Senate the story was similar.",
        "Again, the number of Republicans deserting the president grew, from nine last month to 18 last week to 21 yesterday.",
        "The yays are 70.",
        "The nays are 26.",
        "Two-thirds of the senators voting, having voted in the affirmative, the bill on reconsideration is passed, the objections of the President of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding.",
        "(Soundbite of gavel)",
        "And with that the bill became a law.",
        "But for all the focus on doctor pay and private Medicare plans, the bill actually includes some other key changes.",
        "It renews a program that helps more than a million people with low incomes pay their Medicare premiums.",
        "It will gradually reduce Medicare co-payments for mental health services.",
        "And it will begin the process of getting doctors to file prescriptions electronically rather than on paper, an effort aimed at both saving money and preventing medication errors."

        "We're grateful that we haven't had that problem in the U.S.",
        "It could just be that they've had so many more cases, that the viruses in Mexico found people who are frail, who have underlying heart disease or diabetes and such, and therefore has carried off more people.",
        "We don't think it's a difference in the virus.",
        "The CDC tells us the virus is quite similar.",

        "What does it say to you if an outbreak in a New York City school seems to affect a couple of dozen kids there, but it doesn't seem to extend to the neighborhood around the school or to the families of the students who have it?",
        "Yeah, that's very fortunate because it suggests that at least in our circumstances, the virus is not all that transmissible.",
        "But that leaves open the question: Why is it that it's apparently spreading so much more freely in Mexico?",
        "Once again, that's inexplicable on its face, and we need more information about that.",
        "And at this point, do we assume that people are trying to track the swine flu virus back to some point of origin in Mexico and to find the village, the farm, the individual who might've first contracted this?",
        "Well, that's always part of the intention of a complete public health investigation.",
        "I don't know whether that'll be possible in this circumstance.",
        "But it's always very interesting to try to determine how it is and where and when this virus apparently picked up the genetic capacity to go not just from swine to swine, but from human to human."

        "Yeah.",
        "Actually, I think something like that is possible, except that all the dotted lines go back to Mexico.",
        "Because I believe in each of those circumstances, someone in that group that was affected had recently been in Mexico, gotten on an airplane, probably while they were still well, and shortly after they disembarked, became ill and were able to then spread the virus to a small cluster of acquaintances.",
