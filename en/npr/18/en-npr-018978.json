        "Well, the leaders who pushed for this summit, French President Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, argued the whole world is being affected by this crisis.",
        "Many nations have a stake, and they should have a voice in the solution.",
        "And in addition, with countries like China and India emerging as economic powers, it only makes sense to find solutions that also include them, especially since they actually have currency reserves that can be used to help developing nations that are now being hurt by the crisis.",
        "And one of the real concrete directives coming out of the summit is a call to reform the structure of the world financial institutions.",
        "To give these emerging nations a greater voice is something President Bush addressed in his remarks.",
        "We agree that, to better reflect the realities of today's global economy, both IMF and World Bank should modernize their governing structures.",
        "They ought to consider extending greater voting power and representation to developing nations, particularly those who have increased their contributions to the institutions.",
        "In fact, Andrea, I think getting these emerging nations involved may be the single most significant thing that happened at the meeting today.",
        "I understand that this is just the first of a series of meetings of the G-20 group.",
        "But at the next one, the U.S.",
        "will be represented by a different president.",
        "Right.",
        "President Barack Obama.",
        "Did he have any involvement today?",
        "President-elect Obama was not there, though he had been invited.",
        "His response was that the U.S.",
        "only has one president at a time.",
        "But he did have representatives there, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and former Republican Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa who were not at the table, but they were available on the sidelines to meet with delegations from any nation that wanted to meet with them.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Obama's first meeting with this group is now scheduled for next spring, April 30th, 2009."

        "It's called MTC.",

        "All of us have patients every week in our clinic who, thankfully, don't get worse from one year to the next on standard therapies, and so to show a handful of patients and make that claim was, you know, overreaching.",

        "It tested a drug called Dimebon originally developed as an allergy medication.",
        "After a year on the drug, patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's had much less mental decline than those on placebo, and there was a suggestion of improvement.",
