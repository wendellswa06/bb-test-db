        "Well, after an initial assessment is made of a threat, then we generally put in a set of protective measures that can run the full gamut all the way up to a 24/7 protection detail with any number of people around a protectee's home and their travel, et cetera.",
        "Now the FBI is involved in this case in Texas.",
        "I - again not your bailiwick, but I wonder, when you hear something like that, what's your reaction?",
        "Well, you know, our reaction quite frankly is - I mean, we share reaction that is, you know, any time we see an attack on a prosecutor or a judge at any level, it shows a general disregard for the rule of law.",
        "And anytime we see that, obviously it's concerning to us because from where we sit it does not matter whether it's a state or a local judge or a prosecutor.",
        "You know, an attack on the law is an attack on the law.",
        "And so it does give us pause, and obviously, you know, we try to work as closely with our law enforcement partners to not only track what's going on in this case but in all types of threat cases, even if they involve state and local officials.",
        "And is your job strictly reactive, you wait until there's a threat, or is there a proactive element, as well?",
        "Well, I think there's several proactive things that we like to do.",
        "One, I mean, we're charge with a physical security of court facilities around the United States, and so obviously there's some proactive steps that we put in place.",
        "There's an education part of this for our protectees.",
        "As the judge just mentioned, being aware of your surroundings, being aware when you commute to and from work.",
        "And so there's a whole education piece about personal security awareness when you're not in those secure facilities, when you're at home, when you're commuting.",
        "And then of course there's the work that we do to share our knowledge and work closely with state and local law enforcement so they have benefit of our experience and vice versa whenever they're providing protection for state and local officials.",
        "And so that relationship building is very important to us, and then that whole education piece for our protectees is very important from a proactive standpoint.",
        "And it was interesting, when Judge Cicconetti was talking about, you know, the feeling that even in a municipal court case like his where at worse somebody might get 30 days in jail, everybody's against him, the feeling that some people have that this is, you know, a terrible wrong that needs to be righted.",
        "It is.",
        "It's a common - as he pointed out, it's a common feeling that a lot of individuals who threaten, they have that feeling.",
        "They have a paranoid feeling that the system is stacked against them.",
        "And at the end of the day, judges and prosecutors make decisions that change people's lives.",
        "So whether it's a murder case or whether it's as simple as a bankruptcy case, at the end of the day people's lives are being changed, and people react to those decisions that are made by prosecutors and judges."
