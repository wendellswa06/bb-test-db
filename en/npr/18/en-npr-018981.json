        "If one case happens, Atlanta courthouse a few years ago, do you worry that other people may get the same idea?",
        "I think, you know, anytime you see a crime perpetrated in a particular way against a judge or a prosecutor, again I go back to it makes us think, it gives us pause because we do worry about individuals taking, you know, like steps to - if they feel that, you know, the system is not giving them a fair shake, so to speak.",

        "Well, in terms of the investigation itself, it does not change it significantly in that our entire investigative thrust is to mitigate whatever threat has been made.",
        "That's done through a variety of means, be it subject interviews, be it cooperative interviews with family and friends.",

        "But outside the courtroom, varying your habits, this is not living your life in a normal way.",
        "No, you're 100 percent correct.",
