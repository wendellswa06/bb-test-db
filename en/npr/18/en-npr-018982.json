        "Here's an email, we have this from William in Media, Pennsylvania: Does angry criticism of a judge, prosecutor, law enforcement official qualify as a threat?",
        "Carl Caulk?",
        "Well, I would say angry criticism is kind of a relative term.",
        "I mean, we certainly - if it's criticism of a judge's ruling that they have made in a particular case, and we're certainly aware of and we respect individuals' First Amendment rights.",
        "So, I mean, we have a number of what we would consider to be kind of triggering events that would come into play whenever we assess whether or not somebody's kind of crossed a line.",
        "But angry criticism or criticism in of itself, we do not consider threatening.",
        "We consider it to be protected by an individual's First Amendment rights.",
        "We're talking about - after three murders now in Texas and one in Colorado, just in the past couple of months - about the threats received by cops, prosecutors, judges, prison officials and, as we're hearing, criminal defense attorneys, as well.",

        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.",
        "And Judge Harle, as you consider the kinds of threats you face, is this something you signed up for?",
        "Is this something, had you known about it, might have change your decision about your career choices?",
        "Well, frankly, Neal, I was a prosecutor.",
        "I've been on the bench since 1988, but I was a prosecutor for several years before that, and I was a criminal defense attorney.",
        "And, you know, I enjoy what I do.",
        "I ran for the bench knowing exactly what happens and what could happen.",
        "You don't really have a lot of concern for yourself, but you always worry about dragging your family into it.",
        "And I've been fortunate in that the threats that I've received have not been credible to the extent that I was overly concerned about them, and I didn't have to have the 24/7 security.",
        "But we do, in Bexar County, have that, and several of my fellow prosecutors and judges have had the 24-hour, seven-day-a-week security until the threat level has been assessed to be minimal, or the individual has been caught.",
        "So it is - it's kind of part of the job, and you just, again, can't let it change your quality of life and can't let it change the way you rule on cases and run a fair and impartial court.",
        "Paula's on the line with us from Rockford, Illinois.",
        "Hi.",
        "My father was a chief felony prosecutor.",
        "And as a child, it was absolutely terrifying living with someone in that profession.",
        "We were threatened all the time, and we were told to take caution wherever we went.",
        "We had bomb threats.",
        "We had snipers trying to kill my father, trying to kill us.",
        "It was terrifying.",
        "And how did you cope with it, in the long run?",
        "Well, as I grew older, I'm a psychotherapist now, and I know now that we had post-traumatic stress.",
        "That's - all my brothers and I both developed - all three of us developed post-traumatic stress from living as children with a career prosecutor."

        "Yeah.",
        "We've actually had threats made against family members primarily, instead of our normal, what we would call our normal protectee.",
        "And in many of those cases, we've seen protection provided for not only a judge or a prosecutor or other court family member, but also for family members.",
        "I would echo Barbara's email in that defense counsel are subject to threat.",
        "We investigate threats involving defense counsel, as well, in the federal system.",

        "Well, Paula, thank you very much for the phone call.",
        "And it works just fine as long as we know that there is an immediate threat, but the problem is those people who were prosecuted get out of prison, and then they often try to target the family.",
        "We had bomb threats put underneath our - we had to check the roofs of our cars and lids of our car before we got into them after college classes, because we were supposed to be having bombs underneath those.",
        "Now, if you know there's an immediate threat, then you can take care of it.",
        "But with prosecutors, they have cases for years that can eventually be a threat to them and their family, and they're not going to know about it until it happens.",
        "Again, Paula, thanks very much for the phone call.",
