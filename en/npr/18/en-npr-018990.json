        "Romance was, I think in those old movies, a much more contentious business.",
        "So you - the point of the movie was that you would have, whether it was, you know, Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn or Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert or whoever - two very strong personalities in conflict.",
        "And the result of the conflict would be their union.",
        "And that was the sort of both the romance and the comedy came from that tension that was resolved into love.",

        "But a couple of movies: \"\"Music and Lyrics,\"\" \"\"Love Actually\"\" and \"\"50 First Dates.\"\" And one of the common denominators there is Drew Barrymore.",
        "I think she's really underappreciated as a comedian.",
        "Well, I would agree with you about Drew Barrymore, but I would only agree with you about the quality of one out of three of those movies.",
        "I do like \"\"50 First Dates\"\" quite a bit.",
        "I think it's a charming movie with a very original conceit having to do with her suffering from amnesia and the things always happening to her.",

        "Sort of is, \"\"Groundhog Day,\"\" and has something in common with \"\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\"\" also, about how - I mean, in one way, you solve the problem of how to make, you know, the bliss of first love endure, to have it be a kind of a permanent state of first love.",
        "But I think Drew Barrymore is a wonderful actress, a very funny and very able actress.",
        "I think there are other exceptions, too.",
        "There's one in fact that opened just today that I saw after I had written my piece for last Sunday's paper, which maybe want to, you know, qualify it a little bit, although not take it back entirely, which is a movie called \"\"Definitely, Maybe.",
        "The star of that is Ryan Reynolds.",
        "And it also has a very ingenious twist on the story.",
        "He's telling his young daughter the story of how he met her mother, and you and she have to guess which of the women he's encountering in his past, in the flashback, is going to turn out to be her.",
        "And what I like about this movie is that it's very - while still being enchanted with a kind of a fairytale view of love and romance, it also has a degree of realism and honesty about how people actually behave about the fact that, you know, people get divorced, people break up.",
        "Love is sometimes uncertain or imperfect.",
        "And I think it balances the disillusionment and the longing for illusion and enchantment very well.",

        "Now, they try to show us ours.",
        "Sadly, we aren't interesting as they were.",
        "I think that's a very good point.",
        "I think that that's part of the desire not to alienate the audience so that you want to show people who are perfectly average, pleasant, likeable people who tend to be a bit dull, so the strong individuality that you could see in some of those other movies, the characters that Cary Grant would play or Katharine Hepburn.",
        "Yeah, no one had ever met or knew people like that, but it was thrilling and exciting and glamorous to watch them.",
        "Whereas now, you know, you're watching another movie about people who work in some boring office jobs in Manhattan, but really it was all filmed in Toronto, so they're just a few external Manhattan locations.",
        "And they feel like people who would probably bore you at a party and you're interested to watch them for two hours.",

        "Thanks.",
        "This is very - it's been a very interesting conversation.",
        "But I have to agree with you two, and the other thing, I think, that romantic comedies or even romance so much now is they meet, they have sex and then they start developing a relationship, whereas, like, \"\"It Happened One Night\"\" - I mean the scene where the Wall of Jericho came down, I mean, we don't see that and they've developed a relationship overtime to all of the different things that they've had to go through.",
        "So by the time that happens, you're - I don't know - just more involved in what's going on in the story.",
        "You know, the sexual tension lasts longer than the first reel.",
        "Yes.",
        "Exactly, and I think that sort of tension is what creates - what makes these movies so kind of thrilling and interesting.",
        "And even if you know where they're going, because, I mean, the romantic comedy is almost by definition the most predictable genre there is.",
        "It's the creation of that tension, and it's very hard to do if, you know, if the characters go to bed with each other in the first half hour of the movie, or, if you know that they really would have even if the movie is contriving in some reason that they didn't, you know?"

        "Remember; Michael Flynn resigned under pressure.",
        "There was controversy over whether he misled the vice president about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last year.",
        "And since then, Flynn's really been under a legal cloud - questions about whether he disclosed a payment from Russia for a speech he gave there, whether he should have registered his lobbying activities, and even more questions about what Flynn may have been doing during the campaign and afterward to benefit the government of Turkey.",
        "Special counsel Robert Mueller's asked the White House for documents and information about Flynn.",
        "And now two legal sources are telling me the pressure's intensifying.",

        "For instance, on November 8 last year, on Election Day, Mike Flynn published an op-ed piece in The Hill newspaper.",
        "The headline was \"\"Our Ally Turkey Is In Crisis And Needs Our Support.\"\" The article focused on an elderly cleric named Fethullah Gulen.",
        "He's an enemy of Turkey's current leader, and Flynn concluded we should not provide him safe haven.",
        "Well, today The Wall Street Journal first reported Flynn may have been offered $15 million to arrange for Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, to be forcibly returned to Turkey and the arms of President Erdogan.",
        "My sources confirmed to me a meeting in New York in November - in December, rather - not far from Trump Tower between Flynn and senior Turkish officials.",
        "Now, if that's true, that could break a law that bars Americans from acting as agents of foreign powers, could also implicate other laws on the books, including kidnapping, bribery and other statutes.",
        "So what is Michael Flynn saying about all this?"
