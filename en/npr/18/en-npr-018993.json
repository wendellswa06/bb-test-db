        "Think of the robots that manufacture cars on assembly lines.",
        "But in turn, those robots are a long way from the cutting edge, where some robots are barely beginning to act independently.",
        "Our guest this hour reports that he was startled on a couple of different occasions when he unexpectedly ran into robots that were at least in some respects almost human.",
        "Writer Lee Gutkind spent six years off and on as a fly on the wall at one of the country's leading robotic labs, watching the work of the gear heads and code monkeys who work tirelessly to build robots that will move, see, learn and even understand.",
        "Later in the hour, after Hitler, Stalin and Mao, amid Darfur and Iraq, Harvard Professor Steven Pinker argues that we are probably living at the most peaceful time in history.",
        "But first, robots, technology, and the future.",

        "It's nice to be here.",
        "And you bumped into Grace one night while you were outside a hotel, and for a few seconds, you wondered what was going on.",
        "It scared me to death.",
        "I did - I was not outside a hotel.",
        "I was in the corridors in the middle of the night at the Robotics Institute...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...at Carnegie Melon, and suddenly a creature confronted me and asked me why I was roaming the corridors.",
        "What are you doing here, the creature said.",
        "Now I had spent a number of years interacting with robots, but at that - and I knew as I looked at that robot, I knew that it was a robot, but, you know, it scared me to death.",
        "It surprised me the way in which it confronted me, just for that second, and I was really flummoxed.",
        "I was startled.",
        "Interesting.",
        "You write that, for example, how we humans interface with computers, this has been a respected branch of science for some years now.",
        "How we interface with robots, that's just beginning."

        "Yeah, I'd like to ask your guest, where do you try to balance or where do you draw the line with fuzzy logic - like applying fuzzy logic type of technology versus a true formulation of logic like black or white and make sure that one doesn't infringe upon the other?",
        "I'm not exactly sure what you're asking.",
        "This murder was an extraordinary event in the U.K.",
        "Do you think that it has changed British society?",

        "And it is just now beginning to become important to think about robots and think about how human beings are going to interact with robots, because in 25 or 30 years, we're going to be forced to do just that.",
        "Even now, in hospitals there are nurse-bots which deliver medications and roam the corridors of hospitals doing small but important tasks.",
        "And in Japan there are robots that are help — beginning to help human beings, elderly people, take care of themselves.",
        "And there are robots now, at Carnegie Melon in fact, that act as receptionists, greeting people as they walk into the door.",
        "Yet one of the things that characterizes the search for a robot - and this is something you spend an awful lot of time on - is how do you decide when a robot is autonomous, when it's making independent decisions about the right thing to do?",
        "Well, there's a great range of autonomy, and sometimes roboticists get incredibly excited and feel incredibly positive and say that their robots are being autonomous, which of course what roboticists want.",
        "They want to be able to create and - a figure to create a creature that is very much in their own shadows.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But robotists - there are levels of autonomy.",
        "So sometimes perhaps a robot can walk across a room, go through a door, and do it autonomously.",
        "But then there might be a creature standing right in front of that robot.",
        "The robot might be able to go around that creature, but the robot will not know what that creature is, will not be able to recognize it or perceive it or know if it's a man, a slice of pizza, or a rope dangling from the ceiling.",
        "And so that's not necessarily where we are with the way humans are autonomous, but it's a beginning.",
        "Mm-hmm, one of the things in fact you write about, and most interestingly, is as you look at what is necessary to make an artificial creature do some of the things that we do naturally, you begin to be astonished at just what wondrous beings we truly are.",
        "That's exactly what I was just saying in relation to everyday things that we do.",

        "Robots can speak with you sometimes, but we are such incredible creatures.",
        "I can walk down to the bank and get some cash out of a cash machine.",
        "Robots can't do that yet.",
        "These are just normal, everyday things that we do, and the best that a robot can do in many respects is vacuum a floor or scrub a window.",
        "And so we are very much far away from the multiple, multitasking human being perspective."

        "The Kansas Robot League was started by my younger brother as he was working on his doctorate in education, and now we've spread it into a number of schools in basically the eastern half of the state of Kansas.",
        "Interesting you should mention that.",
        "Lee Gutkind writes about how robots will inspire students much more than teachers or even books, but also he - the way you're writing, Lee Gutkind, those students that Ed's working with in Kansas City, Kansas, they're the - they're going to be the shock troops of the robotics industry in, well, just a couple of year time.",
        "This is what is so - was so amazing to me at Carnegie Melon, that so many - I envision roboticists as someone who looks like me, that is to say -somewhat elderly, wild white hair, kind of maybe looking like an Einstein kind of figure.",
        "But most of the people doing the cutting edge work in robotics today are maybe not middle school people, but are people under 30, and it reminds me of the movement in Mountain - in Silicon Valley at the end of the 1960s and early 1970s when people started to - when young people started to investigate that thing called a computer.",
        "And it's the ideas that were stimulated and the experiments that were done by young people that brought us to the modern computer age of today.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And the same thing is happening with robotics now.",
        "And so I think it's wonderful that - but not necessarily unusual - that middle school students are turned on by robots.",
        "And this is also - robotics is becoming an international language.",
        "It's not just happening in the United States.",
        "It's happening in South America, it's happening in Australia.",

        "Hmm, you write extensively about several different projects in your book - mostly about the people rather than the robots, I do have to say.",
        "There's one in particular I wanted to ask you, and that was a robot called Groundhog which some kids - under the direction of one of your older, wild-haired leaders, a charismatic guy - they ferociously put this robot together to go into a mine -this was after the Quecreek disaster in Pennsylvania...",

        "NPR's Lynn Neary reports on the future of the bookstore chain.",
        "That's true, and that's kind of what robotics seems to be presenting today.",
        "The challenge is so great - and we know a little, we don't know a lot - and so there - here was a group of undergraduate and graduate students - most of whom, as I said, were under 25, led by this charismatic guy, the father of field robotics, a man named Red Whitaker.",
        "And they had this idea that if the Quecreek Mine had been properly mapped, the water would not have flooded the mine and people would not have been so endangered.",
        "And so they decided to create a robot and write the software and try to learn - get a robot to autonomously - now remember, we can't go into the mine, a flooded mine, with the robot - to get the robot to autonomously map the mine.",
