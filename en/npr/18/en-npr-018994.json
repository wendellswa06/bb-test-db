        "They're just not ready for prime time, and people are not putting the money, the resources into such research in order to polish it and make it happen.",
        "And frankly, Neal, we're talking about maybe a three to five-year scope of possibilities.",
        "Just because we pour millions of dollars into robotics doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to move out of these shadowed ages and into the age of robotics.",
        "It's not going to happen for a little while.",
        "But it's never going to happen unless we begin to think and to understand that the future of progress in this world will very much rest on the world of robotics.",
        "Let's get some callers on the line.",
        "We'll turn to Mike.",
        "Mike's with us from Oakland, California.",
        "Yes, thank you for taking my call.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "My question has to do with the - what's happening with communication between robots and humans?",
        "Just as a quick example, companies have IVR systems, and I've had very bad luck with them understanding the responses I give when I'm forced to talk.",
        "I mean I literally yelled an epithet at one when I became frustrated.",
        "And it said, oh, you want customer service.",
        "So I'd be worried about, you know, when your guest said that he was confronted by a robot in the hallway that said what are you doing, I'd be afraid about how the robot would understand the answer and what it would do about it.",
        "Hmm.",
        "I was afraid, too.",
        "And in fact we're way behind.",
        "If we're behind - we're moving ahead with technological research as far as getting robots to become more autonomous, but this human computer, or human robot interaction field, is so far behind.",
        "And, you know, I mean that's kind of what happened with the whole world of computers and the Internet.",
        "We are not - we're allowing technology to explode in front of our eyes without planning for what's - for the impact of technology.",
        "And how the technology is going to interact with human, we are not giving a lot - enough attention to that very important aspect.",
        "Also...",

        "People are just now beginning to understand how important it is for humans and robots to get along.",
        "And of course, as you well know, pretty soon, very soon, as robots progress, robots and humans are going to be working side to side in factories - I mean in space the whole scenario begins with a robot going into space and clearing the way for humans.",
        "And when humans arrive on Mars or on the Moon, they are going to have to work very, very closely with - kind of as supervisors and quality control officers for the robots on the scene.",
        "And if we don't know how to communicate with our robots, we're going to have a lot of difficulty.",

        "Here's an e-mail from Eric, in Cincinnati.",
        "Can your guest speak to the law that was recently passed in Britain to protect the rights of robots, should they become more ubiquitous in our lives?",
        "No.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I think that's - I did not - I am unaware of that law and...",
        "I was going to say it's a surprise to me, too.",
        "Yes.",
        "So I guess I don't know what to say except that it's unclear - it really is unclear - the difference between robots, the potential of robots, and human beings is in many ways unclear.",
        "I mean the subtitle of my book is \"\"Making Robots Think,\"\" and it's very unclear whether even human beings actually think.",
        "Robots are following a set of rules that human beings are writing for them, and in fact kind of thinking that most human beings do on any given day in many respects follow a different set, but also a set of rules as well."

        "Mm-hmm, let's turn to Dave, Dave with us from Sterling Heights in Michigan.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...of microprocessor doubling every year and a half.",
        "Yeah, and I know that there are people at MIT who think that they're going to overtake human intelligence within this century.",
        "But, Lee Gutkind, the way you write about robots in the year 2050, one of the goals of one of your teams was to build a team of robot soccer players who could beat the World Cup champions by 2050.",
        "I'm telling you, that was - actually, it was RoboCup, this whole RoboCup movement that got me involved in writing this book initially.",
        "When I learned that groups of robots were playing soccer against one another, teams of robots, in this RoboCup league - which was launched in I believe 1996 or 1997 -I looked into why.",
        "And the whole goal of the - this RoboCup movement is to be able to develop teams of robots that can be skillful enough physically and also clear enough emotionally and intellectually to beat the pants off of the World Cup champions, human beings, 50 - by the year 2050.",
        "And to me that was really quite a remarkable idea, and I laughed until I saw the robots playing soccer in action.",
        "So you have to kind of look at this, Neal, in two different ways.",
        "These robots cannot play soccer as good as human beings, good human beings can play soccer.",
        "But on the other hand, right now robots can play soccer, they can move a ball back and forth, move a soccer ball - or a smaller ball - back and forth across a court.",
        "They can pass to one another, they can work as a team, they will know when they're winning, and when they're winning they will go into a defensive mode.",
        "And when they're not winning, they'll become quite aggressive.",
        "They can be put into the penalty box and 30 seconds later be put back into the penalty - into play and know - have a great awareness of what the score is and what their teammates are thinking.",
        "So this is quite amazing.",
        "You used a word in that description that a lot of people are going to have a problem when you're talking about robots...",
        "Yes.",
        "...and that's emotions."

        "If in fact robots will not develop this spirit, this soul, this competitive edge, then probably human beings will be able to maintain the lead both in robotics and in life - I mean in soccer and in life for a long time to come.",

        "Well, this - the right or wrong type of logic is obviously the way good formulas and good algorithms begin.",
