        "Hi, Sam.",
        "I'm an engineer.",
        "I worked in robotics in the very, very early stages of robotics.",
        "And we were first, you know - back when the Apple II was actually a popular computer.",
        "But us as engineers, we're so proud and we are so amazed at our accomplishments that we - really what we need to do is look at whether we should do some of the things that we're doing, because if we don't look closely at what we're doing, we're going to end up ruining ourselves.",

        "Well, I lost my job three times to robots.",
        "A lot of us are losing our jobs to robots.",
        "And if we create something that is autonomous - not to debate the whole God theory and everything - but the human strayed, what us makes us think that the robots aren't going to stray?",
        "And what makes us think that we really will remain in control of them?",
        "Lee Gutkind?",
        "We don't know exactly whether we're going to remain in control.",
        "I can just tell you that roboticists now are not trying to create creatures that will run away with the world.",
        "The whole idea with robotics is - the roboticists are not developing robots for the sake of having fun or developing these mechanical creatures.",
        "There's a reason.",
        "There are many important reasons that robots can exist.",
        "And I named a couple, like working with elderly people and working in hospitals and being the pioneers on the moon and Mars.",
        "And yes, it's probably true that in our greatest fear that robots may well take the knowledge from every human being in a surgical process or suck it out in some sort of mysterious vacuum and take over the world.",
        "But I don't think that that's going to happen.",
        "And none of us want it to happen.",
        "I think what we're trying to do is bring together technology - the software part of technology in the case of robots, and the hardware part of technology -and make it serve humanity overall.",
        "That's what the engineers are trying to do, but corporations want to eliminate the bottom line and eliminate costs, and they do that by replacing people with machines.",
        "Now if you take away a nurse that has a heart and cares about a human being that they are taking care of in private situation and you put a machine in there, is that machine going to comfort that person?",
        "I don't think we're taking away a nurse, and I don't think that a robot very soon will be able to take away a job from a nurse.",
        "But robots can do, as I said to you, some really important things, really essential, but necessarily important things, like say deliver medications so that a human being, a nurse, can pay more attention to the patient and not be distracted by jobs that a machine can do.",
        "And let me follow up on what Sam's talking about.",
        "Lee Gutkind, are the engineers that you talk to and spend time with, and the computer scientists, are they thinking about some of the points that Sam raises?",
        "Well, I'll tell you.",
        "There is this tension, and has been for a long time, between the engineers - because the engineers really moved the robotics movement forward initially, and slowly but surely the software folks, the software geeks, have been catching up and taking the power and the influence away from the engineers in the robotics world."

        "And I think that there is this hardware/software rift, this resentment generally in the world - in the engineering world, because they have kind of lost their place in the robotics world.",
        "Right now, robotics is pretty much controlled by people who are writing code and, in fact, making robots think.",
        "Someday soon, this code and the hardware that operates the code will come together again and work together more smoothly.",

        "For those of you too young to remember, the phrase war on cancer isn't mine.",
        "It's Richard Nixon's.",
        "In 1971, Nixon - then president - declared war against this enemy.",

        "Now I don't think there's anybody who hasn't.",
        "But what do scientist mean when they talk about cancer?",
        "I think the context here is very important.",
        "So for a normal cell to become a cancer cell, for this aspiring cancer cell to achieve its malignant endpoint, it needs to acquire a range of biological capabilities.",
        "It needs to divide inappropriately, become resistant to death signals, acquire a state of immaturity not unlike that of stem cells, it needs to instruct the surrounding host to do things like grow new blood vessels, not attack it with its immune system and so on.",
        "And underlying these newly acquired biological capabilities are genetic changes that occur in the cell's DNA that are required, you know, in a more or less stepwise fashion during the life history over this evolving cancer cell.",
        "And essentially these DNA changes attack two major classes of genes, genes that promote the development of cancer - those who are called oncogenes - and others that are eliminated or extinguished during the cancer process, and those are called tumor suppressor genes.",
        "And there is a staggering amount of complexity as we peer into the cancer cell and its genetic makeup with now very high-resolution DNA scanning technologies.",
        "It is a sea of complexity where there are dozens upon dozens of changes that occur in a cancer cell.",
        "And the big challenge for us has been to identify the mission-critical changes against this sea of complexity, identifying the genes that, if we were to correct them with drugs, would lead to a collapse of the tumor.",
        "And those are called tumor maintenance genes.",
        "You could think of them as the Achilles' heel.",
        "Tight.",
        "Now you just described a set of changes that have to take place in a normal cell - quite a number of them - in order for a cancer to begin and then propagate.",
        "How does it happen that we get unlucky enough for all of these things to sort of happen?",
        "Well, there are a variety of processes: inflammation, the aging process, dietary factors, environmental factors that all conspire to change, acquire a subset of changes in our DNA.",
        "And if we're unlucky enough to target some critical genes that initiate the process, what then happens over the life of that cell is that there is the opportunity for, let's say, mutate or instability mechanism to suddenly occur."

        "And this creates a hyper mutation situation, a cauldron of change that allows cells to acquire all of these genetic changes.",
        "And so what we see when we analyze the cancer cells at the end of the process is an enormous number of change.",
        "But we want to identify the critical lynchpins in that sea of complexity.",
        "So what's the evidence?",
        "I mean, you say that there have to be critical lynchpins and you have to find the Achilles' heel but, you know, people have been talking that way, oh, I'm sure for 20 years now.",
        "Why do you think we're closer, you know, to getting there today than we were 10 years ago, for example?",
        "Well, I think there's been truly a revolution in our understanding of cancer thanks to the investment that you mentioned at the very beginning of the talk.",
        "But about 10 years ago, we asked a very similar question that was published recently in a series of papers that we'll be talking about shortly; where asked the question: If we were to engineer mice with a switchable ankA gene, a gene that initiates the cancer process, once that cancer acquires many other genetic alterations, is that inciting genetic alteration still important in maintaining the tumor?",
        "And what we found in this mouse model of a skin cancer called melanoma is that if we extinguished that particular gene, which was the RAS ankA gene, it led to a complete collapse in the tumor and the mice were essentially cured.",
        "And so if we can identify such critical genetic elements against the backdrop of all of these other changes, then they would be worthy therapeutic points of attack.",
        "And in fact this concept has now been translated into clinical reality, so there are certain drugs that I'm sure you talked about in the past on your program called Gleevec that target emission-critical change in a blood cancer that, upon treatment, these patients - and this was essentially an incurable disease of the blood, a blood cancer - led to the elimination of those cancer cells from these patients and essentially elimination of the gene product and its aberrant activities, leading to substantial cures and prolongation and survival in many of the patients.",

        "I'm not in any way a scientist.",
        "I'm an avid reader of scientific information, though, and this subject fascinates me.",
        "So I have kind of a - something that I've gleaned from my research that maybe might be somewhat of a controversial view.",
        "You have a great day.",
        "I totally like how you're, you know, talking about it being a foreign entity, invasion, you know, the tumor in the body.",
        "Of course, I don't know all the scientific terms for it.",
        "But I think a lot of times through our lifestyle that we've brought it upon ourselves, allowed our bodies to have that invasion.",
        "And you know, I think everyone always speaks of looking for a magic cure, a drug or something, which might be possible.",
        "I think a lot of times, though, just our health, just changing our diet or the way we live can also remove a tumor.",
        "I've seen it firsthand in my mom, for example.",
        "I just wanted to point that out.",
        "I think there's a lot of things that could be done to counteract that organism that has, you know, come into the body.",
