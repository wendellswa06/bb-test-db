        "That's a very insightful question.",
        "So cancer is really the culmination of all of these genetic alterations, and those genetic alterations come from a variety of sources.",
        "One is we're born perhaps with a few of those from our genetic makeup.",
        "That's called family history and risk.",
        "Others are accumulated during the normal aging process.",
        "And in fact advancing age is the most important cancer-causing agent, so to speak.",
        "And the other thing, which we have a tremendous amount of control over, is our behavior and the kinds of insults that are brought about as a result of extensive ingestion of certain compounds or - such as tobacco smoke or excessive drinking and things of that nature.",
        "And a great deal of what we can do in our lives is try to alter our exposure to those kinds of activities that can have a dramatic impact on the risk of developing cancer as we age.",
        "In fact, there has been recent news over the past couple of years - the deaths due to cancer are declining.",
        "This is quite remarkable because with advancing age, cancer incidents should increase, and yet we're seeing a reversal in the trend.",
        "So this is remarkably good news, and a great deal of that has to do with prevention and change in lifestyle, such as reduced smoking and a variety of other things.",
        "So I think it's critical to make sure that you adopt a healthy lifestyle, exercise, don't smoke, don't excessively drink, and listen to your mom and eat your vegetables.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah, that sounds like good advice always.",

        "Yes, sir.",
        "My question is - I'd like to hear him speak about the research that's been done on women who breast-fed their babies, how that effects a woman's rate of cancer or if there's any effect on the child.",
        "OK, Minnie, thanks for that question.",
        "Ron DePinho?",
        "I can answer that question, sure.",
        "Actually, there have been excellent studies that have shown that there are dramatic reductions in the risk of developing breast cancer for those women who do breast feed.",
        "And in fact if you breast feed for a collective time of two years, you get the most dramatic reductions, and they're quite remarkable."

        "Breast cancer also brings up some opportunities to talk about how great the advances have been in cancer science and cancer care, because it's there that we've had dramatic effects on the deaths due to breast cancer.",
        "There's another magical drug that has been developed called Herceptin that targets one of these mission-critical genes that we talked about in the development of cancer.",
        "It's called the - it's a receptor that's important for regulating the growth of breast-cancer cells, and this has had a dramatic impact on the survival of patients with cancer.",
        "We're talking with Harvard University Medical School's Professor Ron DePinho about cancer and about the war on cancer.",
        "I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "So you mentioned just a minute ago that cancer rates are - cancer deaths are going down; and surprisingly so because the population in general is aging, and you'd expect to see more deaths, more cancers because of that.",
        "So the question I'm wondering is, you know, does it make sense to load your research dollars into prevention and realize that maybe, you know, basic research is just going to take a long time and it's not going to really find the answers in the same kind of time scale as prevention research is in terms of at least helping save the population lines?",
        "I think that - you need a balanced portfolio.",
        "You need Normandy invasion on this beast that we call cancer.",
        "I think prevention will shift the dial so that you diminish the risk, but there are certain individuals that are going to develop cancer as a result of exposures, as a result of advancing age, that are due to intrinsic processes that push people towards this increased risk for developing a malignancy.",
        "So we need to have increasingly sophisticated strategies to do a number of things.",
        "One is to prevent.",
        "There are now vaccines that can be directed that will lead to dramatic reductions in the development of cervical cancer, for example.",
        "We need increased ability to scan into a patient's body to identify early-stage cancers so that they can be surgically removed.",
        "And for patients that present with established fully formed disease, for cancers that grow enormously fast, we need to really understand what makes those cancers tick.",
        "And what's really different, what feels differently now than it did even just five years ago is that we were truly on the threshold of understanding in a very complete way the genetic basis for cancer.",
        "We now have in hand model systems that can help us understand which changes are critically important, and we now have increasingly sophisticated technologies to develop drugs that can, like smart bombs as opposed to carpet-bombing, really target those activities that are conferred by those specific tumor-maintenance genes.",
        "So this is a really an inflection point in the history of the field, where I think, you know, I'm a collector of medical textbooks, and I have textbooks that range back from the 1930s.",
        "And there are whole textbooks that are devoted to infectious diseases that are now mere footnotes in today's textbooks because of all of the treatments.",
        "And it's safe to say that with the remarkable advances that we're seeing in science now, our children will look back on this period as a very similar period where there was an inflection point.",
        "We'll have the equivalent of antibiotics that will allow us to quell these rogue cells in our body and really have an impact on the quality of life."

        "Great, thanks.",
        "So Ron DePinho, the 30-second answer on that one, please.",
        "So essentially, cancer is an organ system and there small - a subset of cells in the cancer, within the tumor, that are responsible for giving rise to the tumor mass.",
        "And those are equivalent to, let's say, our normal blood cells, our stem cells, that give rise to the many blood-cell types that we have in our body.",
        "And the notion is that if we can specifically target those cells, we would be able to generate durable cures against cancer.",
        "And so this is just another example of an exciting breakthrough that cancer science has illuminated as a result of the investment, and it's now positioning us to develop therapies that are going to attack this particular compartment that is responsible for maintaining the tumor at large.",
        "OK, Dr. DePinho, we have to leave it there.",

        "And the people who are still inside, some of them probably ran away toward the rebel forces rather than toward the government side when fighting intensified.",
        "Obviously, they want to be in a safe place, but some of them don't believe that being in a government area is a safe place for them.",
