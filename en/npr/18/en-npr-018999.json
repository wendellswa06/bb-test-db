        "That position changed abruptly in 2000, when the executive council of the AFL-CIO voted to reverse itself, calling for undocumented immigrants to be granted citizenship.",
        "It was a result of years of internal pressure from unions representing service workers - a large number of whom were Latino.",
        "At the time Ana Avendano was with the United Food and Commercial Workers.",
        "She says unions like hers argued that existing immigration policy allowed employers to take advantage of such workers.",
        "It was a union busting tool.",
        "It was another way for employers to just strip workers of their rights.",
        "In other words, whenever a worker complained about not being paid their wages or complains of sexual harassment or tried to form a union, all the employer had to do was call immigration and they could deport away their problem.",
        "Avendano is now with the AFL-CIO.",
        "She says that day in 2000, meant the organization recognized the struggles of illegal workers, making their cause the AFL-CIO's cause.",
        "Louis DeSipio, a professor of Chicano/Latino Studies at the University of California, Irvine, says the AFL-CIO had its eye on potential new members and that the move was a recognition of changing national and union demographics.",
        "The fastest growing unions have been the service sector unions.",
        "And those are overwhelmingly made up of immigrants and then family members of immigrants.",
        "So, and for the unions to represent their membership on some level, they have to be sensitive to the family concerns that drive support for legalization.",
        "Prior to the year 2000, both political parties were divided on immigration.",
        "Democrats had ethnic interest groups on one side and unions on the other, while Republicans were divided between social conservatives and business interests.",
        "The union shift united Democrats and gave labor more clout.",
        "For Republicans, the internal fight over immigration continues.",
        "This has put the Democrats well ahead of the GOP on this issue, at a time when Latino voters are growing in numbers and power.",

        "We have a name for this technique, when one person talks so much that nothing else can get done.",
        "We call it being a jerk.",
