        "I know the prime minister of your country, Gordon Brown, is talking about something approaching the Bretton Woods Agreement, which set up the financial system that the people have grown up with and have known for decades now.",
        "Is anything like that remotely possible?",
        "I don't think it is.",

        "Bretton Woods, which was set up at the end of the Second World War had fixed exchange rates which lasted until the early 1970s.",

        "But it would be silly to have a world system which didn't include those two countries.",
        "Now of course, both China or India are more regulated than either Europe or America.",
        "So it does not say, we couldn't construct a system which is a bit more regulated, which they both played a part.",

        "So we really need to make sure they're comfortable with any new system because it's their money that we are relying on.",
        "Is there any level of which China and India are watching this crisis?",
        "And I don't want to say smiling, but anticipating some benefits over the long term, over the United States being humbled a little bit.",
