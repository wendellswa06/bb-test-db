        "Let's hear from you both just briefly on what you think this day means, what it stands for.",
        "Dr. Darrow?",
        "I think it's a historic day.",
        "I think it's a day of a laudable first step toward covering more Americans who desperately need coverage.",
        "So Im very excited about it.",
        "And, Dr. Knaysi?",
        "Well, I mean, I think this is a tremendously big day in terms of the health care in this country.",
        "A lot of things have been accomplished that have been very difficult.",
        "I have, as I did before, concerns about the economics of it.",
        "But there were two main problems.",
        "One was access and the other was cost, and I think this dealt with access, maybe at the expense of cost.",
        "We'll see.",
        "Dr.",
        "Knaysi, you have expressed concerns when we spoke a year ago, too, about what this health care overhaul will mean for your practice as a breast cancer surgeon.",
        "What are those fears?",
        "Well, I think that we sense, with all the complexity in the 2,700 pages that there will probably be more regulation.",
        "And that generally translates for us into more overhead.",
        "I suspect if they're planning to take $500 billion out of Medicare that part of that will also come from physician's fees.",
        "The Medicare really is sort of our basic insurance for probably about 40 percent of most doctors' patients.",
        "And all the other insurance reimbursements are based on Medicare.",
        "So that is another concern that I would have going forward.",
        "The other thing is that there'll be additional 30 or 32 million patients in the system.",
        "And since we're all very busy, you wonder how long the waits will be to bring those people into the system.",
        "I mean, theyve been in the system but only pretty much on an emergency basis.",
        "Now theyll be asking for more to be done and thats good, but Im not sure how much we'll be able to deliver in a punctual manner.",
        "Dr.",
        "Darrow, when you and I spoke last summer, you told me that what you really would like to see is a single-payer system.",
        "Obviously you did not get that.",
        "You didnt get a government-run option either.",
        "Do you think this package of changes is going to make a difference to your patients at the Pueblo there in New Mexico and to your practice as a family doctor?",
        "Yes, I think it will.",
        "I think it's a first step.",
        "I thought a lot about the issue of cost and I think I would boil it down philosophically to how can we afford not to?",
        "We already pay double the amount of any other wealthy nation for a very dubious privilege of higher infant and maternal mortality.",
        "We have a life expectancy thats 42nd highest in the world.",
        "And we're about the only nation thats wealthy that doesnt ensure coverage for all citizens.",
        "So, I think broadly it's a good bill.",
        "I think in terms of overall costs down the road, by having access to preventive services, hopefully people will be able to get the care that they need sooner to prevent problems from becoming catastrophic and then breaking the bank later on.",
        "So I do see benefit from this in a number of different ways."

        "Have you been getting questions from your patients about health care overhaul, what it means, how it will affect their care, Dr. Darrow?",

        "New Mexico is traditionally a poor state and we have, as we spoke last time, many people who dont have access to services and/or are underinsured.",
        "So I think the attitude that I have experienced is one of optimism, one of happiness, one that something at last is going to be done - it's a start.",
        "And I think people are grateful for that.",
        "And, Dr. Knaysi, what are you hearing from your breast cancer patients?",
        "I hear a lot from them but I must be dealing with different folks.",
        "Many of them are Medicare patients and they usually come in - and I dont bring it up.",

        "Im afraid Im going to have more cost and less coverage.",
        "And the younger people I dont think talk about it as much as the Medicare people do.",
        "And what do you tell those Medicare patients who are so worried?",
        "Well, I say I dont really know whats going to happen.",
        "I think that they may be right, that it may cost more, but that hopefully the care would still be of equal quality.",
        "And, Dr. Darrow, let me come back to you.",
        "I wonder if you can think of a specific case, a patient youve seen, someone who really comes to mind, as you think about this bill that was signed into law today, and what it might mean for that person?",
        "Sure.",
        "I think that Ill use, for sake of a good example, my mother who died in November, who was a person with some means, who would not take her prescription medications but every other day or every third day because she was concerned about cost.",
        "She also did not go to see her cardiologist several times, even though she was having symptoms that later proved to be serious chest pain that ultimately took her life.",
        "I saw her cardiologist a couple of times, who's a friend of mine.",
        "And he would ask me, why isnt your mom coming in to see me?",
        "And only later did I learn that she was so concerned about cost, so concerned that her chest pain was really a harbinger of a heart problem, that instead of going and seeing about it, she pulled back and decided not to do anything because she didnt want to spend the money.",
        "Hmm.",

        "Yeah, about six miles away.",
        "And I would try to supervise her prescriptions and stay aware of what she was taking.",
        "And I noticed that, golly, the pills are staying around a long time and she wasnt going back to the pharmacy to get more.",
        "And after doing some simple arithmetic it was obvious that she was taking one of her pills every other day.",
        "One that she was supposed to be taking four times a day, she was taking twice a day just to stretch them out.",
        "So I think thats a real example that I see every day in my practice of people who deny themselves medications, immunizations, other services, other visits that they need because they either can't afford it, dont have access to it, or it's beyond their means in other ways.",
        "They're afraid of the cost or what might happen.",

        "So Lieberman took him to his lab at Harvard University.",
        "He had him run over a flat, metal plate that measures the collisional force of a footfall.",
        "Lieberman says runners generate a lot of collisional force.",
        "Most runners, when they land and they heel strike - they land on their heel - they generate this sudden impulse, this sharp spike of force.",
        "So its like somebody hitting you on the heel with a hammer about one-and-a-half to three times your body weight.",
        "Lieberman was surprised by the extremely low force readings made by the barefoot runner.",
        "He ran across the force plate and he didnt have it.",
        "And I thought, gee, thats really amazing and it kind of makes sense because that spike of force hurts, and I wonder if other barefoot runners do that."

        "So Lieberman tested several groups of runners: Kenyans whod been walking and running barefoot all their lives, and Americans who grew up walking and running in shoes, and some who switched from shoes to running barefoot.",
        "He found that runners in shoes usually land heel-first.",
        "Barefoot runners land farther forward, either on the ball of their foot or somewhere in the middle of the foot, and then the heel comes down.",
        "That spreads the impact force across the foot, ankle and lower leg muscles.",
        "There' s less sudden vertical force shooting up the leg that way.",
        "Also, people who switched from shoes to barefoot running eventually, without prompting, adopted the barefoot style.",
        "Lieberman, who runs marathons himself, says the reason is simple.",
        "Its pain avoidance.",
        "Its very easy to do.",
        "And your body naturally tells you what to do.",
        "Running shoes dampen the shock of a heel-first landing.",
        "So, Lieberman says, thats probably why shoed people run that way.",
        "But is that the most efficient way to run?",
        "Lieberman thinks not.",
        "Turns out that the way in which barefoot runners run seems to store up more energy.",
        "To understand how that works, I talked with anthropologist Brian Richmond at George Washington University.",
        "He points out that the human foot has an arch with ligaments inside that stretch and contract with every footfall.",
        "It allows the arch of the foot and the calf muscles to act as a better spring and to store up energy, and then give it back in the beginning of the next step.",
        "Think of a compressed mattress spring pushed down and then released.",
        "Richmond agrees with Lieberman that the front-first landing of barefoot running probably capitalizes on that spring mechanism more than heel-first landing - it gets more spring out of the spring.",
        "Richmond, in fact, has discovered fossilized footprints dating back a million and a half years.",
        "Those human ancestors who left them had an arch.",
        "They were walking when they left the prints.",
        "But Richmond now suspects that when they ran, they landed front-first.",
        "It looks like this is how our ancestors have been running for a million years or more.",
        "Its only been in the last 10,000 years weve had any kind of shoes, really."
