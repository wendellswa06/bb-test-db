        "We still think they're not going to default, but if they do, you need to know that you have some money coming from us.",

        "government is going to be put in the position of being a private equity firm.",
        "It's just a very ugly situation, and unfortunately it's arisen because we did decide at the first day that you could not possibly risk basically making the debt holders, who were the ones that lent all this money to AIG in the first place, take any pain at all.",
        "Right.",
        "And, so looking back at that, do you think that that was the wrong decision or could it really have led to an even worst financial collapse?",

        "It's a tough question and obviously what happened with Lehman Brothers is what is scaring the bejesus out of people, which is that you had failures, suddenly all banks stopped lending to each other, everybody was panicked that if you gave money to a bank, it would be vaporized, and they stopped lending to corporations, and the entire global credit market seized up.",
        "And we basically spent the six months after Lehman trying to recover from that situation.",
