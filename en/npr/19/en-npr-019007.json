        "And my hope is still that the government can actually step in to the AIG situation, take the debt holders, there's $225 billion of long-term debt.",
        "And say, look, I'm sorry, you guys have to take a hit, and it's going to really hurt and it's going to scare everybody else, but we're sick of bailing you out ourselves, and that you can have this managed situations where the both the debt holders and the shareholders of this troubled companies pay up for the stupidity of the management teams.",

        "Well, next week, they will announce their fourth quarter loss, and it will be a loss of what is expected to be some $60 billion.",
        "So, next week we'll see some action?",
        "Next week, you will probably see AIG whimpering with its hand out again saying we'll destroy the western world as we know it, if you don't bail us out again.",
        "At this point, the government is still incredibly reluctant to say to the people who originally lent money to AIG, which now includes the U.S.",

        "And, hopefully we'll go down that road, but at this point we're not hearing any noises out of the government that suggest that that's a possibility.",

        "It's an interesting life.",
        "I did it for three years under President Bush, and it's kind of a unique kind of journalism you perform in the White House press corps.",

        "But at the White House, you're kind of penned up in that White House briefing room, and you spend a lot of time trying to email and call White House aides to try to find out what's going on, and that's a pretty arduous task.",

        "You just, you kind of rotate on - but the question is more, for the people who are part of the press corps, is there a lot of color in the room?",
        "Is there a lot of diversity?",
        "And does it make a difference?",
        "I mean, I know that you have a perspective from being in that position, but do you think, as much as you can tell us, that it makes a difference whether or not you have people of color who are part of the White House press corps?",
        "Yeah, I certainly think it makes a difference, and it makes a difference not only under a black president, either.",
        "You know, I was struck by how few African-Americans, and really, other minorities were in the press corps when I did it under Bush.",
        "And really, I mean, that's actually a charge you could probably apply to the business generally.",
        "It seems like diversity is - it's slipping.",
        "I don't know that latest numbers, but it just doesn't feel like it's expanding, despite all the talk about it.",
        "And I think it matters when it comes down to stories, kind of our filters.",
        "Not that every black or minority reporter will filter stories the same way, but I think we have different, you know, different sensibilities and so on that would elevate some things into the level of, you know, being a story while maybe, you know, pushing other things aside.",
        "I think we'd bring different contexts to stories.",

        "We just had this campaign with, as you pointed out, the first African-American family about to enter the White House.",
        "A lot of people would have thought that on the campaign trail we would have had a lot more African-Americans and other people of color there.",
        "But as Michael and others can tell you, on that campaign plane often there were maybe one or two, if that, people of color on the plane.",
        "Even last week at the president-elect's first news conference, there were no journalists of color who were called on to ask any questions.",
        "And this - the background of all this, as you pointed out, is the newsrooms are undergoing this great contraction because of the contraction in the economy and also because of the migration of advertising dollars to the Internet.",
        "Meanwhile, the demographics of the country are changing, and you know, people of color are going to be the majority in a few decades, and it's even more important to have diversity of coverage and diversity on staff.",

        "What is the importance of lived experience?",
        "And this could cut either way.",
        "I'm thinking about the moments during the riots after Reverend King's death when a lot of people who were black and in the newsroom but who were not reporters, who were, you know, copy clerks and things like that, were sent out to cover the news.",
        "And folks found out, wow, surprise, these guys actually can be reporters.",
        "And they weren't necessarily formally trained in any way, but they also hadn't been given the opportunity.",
        "But when the fire got hot, literally, black folks were sent out to cover what was going on in black communities.",
        "At the same time, you want to think as a reporter that you can learn so that you don't have to be of one race to be able to cover a certain topic.",
        "How do you make sense of the question of lived experience as well as learned experience when you go out on the road, Michael?",
        "That's an interesting question.",
        "One thing I do know is you talk about the kind of the first generation of sort of the big wave of African-American reporters coming in.",
        "I look back, it's interesting, striking, to look back at newspaper coverage, you know, from 30 or 40 years ago, particularly when the black community is being written about, and just the distance that you can sense in the stories.",
        "Like, you know, where writing is almost like, you know, we were venturing to a foreign land to write about these people.",
        "And I think there's sort of that lived experience that closes that gap.",
        "You know, we write with, you know, with more familiarity.",
        "We write like, you know, this is part of our society, you know.",
        "So I think it just sets a different tone for the coverage.",
        "So let me just add to this, when you have a black family - and as Richard pointed out, it really will be a family and not just one person - in the White House, is there a value to having at least some people who have lived experience of being black?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I would like to think so.",
        "I think of course.",
        "I mean, I think there are just so many things you kind of get instantly that, you know, that wouldn't be maybe obvious to someone who doesn't have that same, as you put it, lived experience.",
        "So I think it's important.",
        "Again, it's not to say that if Richard and I are covering, you know, the White House we're going to write the exact same stories and our stories will, you know, always agree.",
        "But at the same time, I think there's a certain kind of, again, sort of cultural kind of understanding that, you know, you sort of have just intuitively.",
        "Richard, what's the path ahead for news organizations dealing with their needs to cover a time of immense change in America, including changes in how we perceive race and leadership?",
        "And you know, when you as a company leader face a situation like this where there's massive layoffs and news organizations just shutting down, why would you want to prioritize diversity?",
        "What's - why is it important?",
        "Because your audience is becoming more diverse, and you want to be able to relate to those members of your audience, of your readership or your listenership.",
        "Indian Americans, for example, are voracious newspaper readers.",
        "And so it makes sense if you're a newspaper and you've got an Indian American community to try to cater to that audience so they'll keep buying your paper."

        "So the future of the business is in catering to the changing demographics in your own market, and there's - even though there's been a contraction in the general interest newspapers, we find that ethnic newspapers and broadcast outlets are just - you know, Hispanic publications and weekly newspapers that cater to certain ethnic groups are actually growing.",
