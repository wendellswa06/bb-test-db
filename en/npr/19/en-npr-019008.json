        "I'm intrigued by the fact that you say that with eyes focused on the regular rapid movement of the needle, we didn't see one another.",
        "So, very often, our conversations were actually confessions.",
        "Oh yes.",
        "When we talked, it was about telling stories more than to confess or to confine, I would say.",
        "But the fact that we did not see each other, you know, we became hypnotized by the movement of the needle, so it was easier almost to talk because we felt like we were just talking to ourselves.",
        "Towards the end, you write talking about their lives now, my Aunt Six and her husband travel first-class and have to stick a sign on the back of their seats so the hostesses will stop offering them chocolates and champagne.",
        "Thirty years ago, in our Malaysian refugee camp, the same Step-Uncle Six crawled more slowly than his eight-month-old daughter because he was suffering from malnutrition.",
        "Thirty years ago, we lived in the dark with them, no electricity, no running water, no privacy; today, we complain that their house is too big.",
        "And it's true.",
        "It's true, it's too big.",
        "You know, at Christmas, we get to be around 40 people and it has three or four days, and we talk a lot.",
        "And my family, my husband, who's Canadian and the only child in his family, the first time he came, he said that, oh my God, it's like having 42 radio stations on at the same time.",
        "'Cause everybody's talking and nobody's listening, of course.",
        "And, yeah, so, you know, we have rooms and then each family would retreat into a room.",
        "And so back then when we were all in the same small apartment for Christmas, I think that we understood each other a lot better because we were so close to each other.",
        "And I would love for us to go back to the small apartment with the 40 of us sleeping, some of us sleeping in a bathtub.",
        "Do you think there's something in your story that goes for almost any immigrant, including those arriving today in North America?",
        "Probably.",
        "I didn't know, you know, when I wrote it I thought that I would be the only person who will read it.",
        "And then afterwards, I said, oh, maybe my children, you know, they would be forced to read it, and then maybe my family.",
        "But then my family's not interested because they know the story, they've lived through the same things.",
        "And so I thought my friends.",
        "So, I'm very surprised that today it's all over.",
        "You know, it's in 20 countries.",
        "And I would tell you that the nicest compliment would come from a Vietnamese person who would come up to me and said that, oh, thank you for telling my story.",
        "Kim Thuy.",

        "Thanks so much for being with us.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Since the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network went live in 1979, its self-effacing founder became C-SPAN's most visible presence and tireless advocate.",
        "Brian Lamb convinced cable companies to fund his fledgling operation, convinced first the House of Representatives and then the U.S.",
        "Senate to let cameras inside.",
        "Over all these years, C-SPAN has been staunchly nonpartisan and purposely very low key.",
        "And for the first time, it will have a new CEO.",
        "Brian Lamb announced that he will leave his post on April 1st.",
        "How has C-SPAN changed politics, journalism, and how has it changed your viewing habits?",
