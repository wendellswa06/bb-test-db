        "It's almost immeasurable.",
        "I wrote a letter to President Bush well back, recommending you for the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and I think you did receive it.",

        "Brian Lamb's direction on C-SPAN will be missed.",
        "That raises the question: I think, I was using the expression relentlessly nonpartisan earlier today.",
        "That was the goal from the beginning, no?",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "Yeah.",
        "This is - you know, it's really interesting what's happened to television, and I don't - it doesn't bother me.",

        "You didn't have to do it.",
        "There's no law about that, but I think it worked out for our industry in the right way, and, you know, it's - what - the audience goes to personalities, and you know that, Neal.",

        "As a matter of fact, I'm not a prude, but I go to the movies and then wonder - I asked myself the same question, and I watch HBO and some of the comedy stuff, and I'm constantly asking myself, why have we gone there?",
        "It seems like it's unfortunate.",
        "It's so cheap.",
        "It's so easy.",

        "It usually comes in spurts, and then it goes away for a long time.",
        "So we're always - I don't know whether you guys have delay or not, but we are always looking at this and we get close to the delay and nobody really wants to do it because they want to keep it free and open.",
        "But if the American people abuse this privilege, some day we may have to do that.",

        "Brian, I have a question.",
        "There's a famous scene of Newt Gingrich standing up in the well of the House, attacking the Democratic leadership, and Tip O'Neill instructed the cameras to show - to pan to an empty House chamber.",
        "Do you have - that's a very memorable moment for me on C-SPAN.",
        "Do you have a particular memorable moment?",
        "Oh, there's a lot of them.",
        "I think my most memorable moments have come at a time when you least expect it, when you learned something.",
        "There could be these times, like the - actually, you know, Ken, your memory is a little off because it wasn't Newt Gingrich that was standing at the microphone when the camera was switched.",
        "It was Bob Walker.",
        "And the only reason I mentioned that is because Trent Lott walked in into chamber and handed him a note and said, you don't realize this, but the camera is showing the entire chamber.",
        "But it was Newt Gingrich's group that led to that, and he's the one that got under this speaker's scan.",
        "And eventually, they took the speaker's - they took his words down.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I was wondering - and this sort of feeds off on some of the other questions you've been asked.",
        "But since you've been there, there's been a lot of technological changes that had been made in communication, and I wonder one of the things, I guess, that people have talked about, just as your last anecdote was, was sort of a manipulation by politicians of the communication.",
        "And I just wonder, how do you think that the Internet, websites, Twitter or things like that are affecting Congress?",
        "I don't really know how it's affecting Congress as much as I know how it's affecting us.",
        "First of all, I think this change is tremendous.",
        "I think it's given the average person some real power in their own hands to create, to communicate, to have an impact on the system."

        "All of our dates revolved around watching every single primary debate from both parties during the 2008 election and then conventions and the election coverage.",
