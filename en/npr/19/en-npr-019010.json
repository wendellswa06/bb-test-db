        "They can grow bones in the lab.",
        "You saw them grow bones and hearts?",
        "And they also do blood vessels, so I just want to get all their things out there.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "You know, body parts.",
        "They do body parts in the lab.",
        "It's pretty amazing.",
        "So in this incubator, you walk into the lab, and you - it sort of looks like a normal lab.",
        "There are beakers and the lab bench, and then in the corner, there are these little things that look sort of like a mini fridge.",
        "But you open it up, and there's beating heart muscle just beating along that they have cultured themselves.",
        "And they start with a few different types of cells.",
        "So sometimes, they work with human embryonic stem cells and sort of coax them into becoming heart muscle, and other times, they start with rat heart cells and then kind of disassociate them from the rat heart and then make them come back together and make this piece of beating muscle.",
        "Are they trying to create the whole heart or just parts of it or...",
        "No.",
        "They're really - this lab, and it's Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic, although I'm sure she would pronounce it differently."

        "Is really focused on making heart patches, and the idea is that if you have a piece heart that dies because of heart disease, you could just sort of stick it on.",
        "And the nice thing about working with human embryonic stem cells is that if you're using reprogrammed stem cells, for example, you could use it from someone's skin, reprogram it, turn it into a stem cell and then turn it into heart muscle.",
        "That's far away.",
        "We're not there yet.",
        "We're not there yet.",
        "And if you go to see Flora's video up on our website at sciencefriday.com, up there in the Video Pick of the Week on the left, and you look at the video and you can actually - this is amazing.",
        "You can watch the hearts - it's not - the heart - just pieces of heart, but they're beating together.",
        "It's contracting.",
        "I mean, this is kind of...",
        "They're beating.",
        "...they're - the cells in unison are beating together, and they're hooked up.",
        "They're in a petri dish, but you'll notice immediately that there are alligator clips and two electrodes in the petri dish.",
        "So it's not your normal petri dish, right?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "And it's attached to this little box where you can change the voltage coming in and the cycles per second, so they actually can turn the dial, and the heart rate of these cells will go up or down.",
        "It's really, you know, weird.",
        "It matches the electrical current beat.",
        "Yeah.",

        "So three beats per second is sort of the resting heart rate of a rat, and so they like to - or you can turn it down to one.",

        "Well, yeah.",
        "I think for anybody who takes an interest in these things, it's always a great moment when you actually see something new for the first time.",
        "And it was one of those sort of instant moments where you just looked at something and you go, oh, that's - that was why we were having trouble identifying it, because it's not a helicopter we've seen before.",
        "And it was immediately assumed that this was stealth technology.",
        "It was fairly obvious.",
        "The shaping that you could see around the mast that carries the tail rotor, the stabilizing rotor on the back, and the shape that you could see on the back of - the rear end of the helicopter's tail boom was very reminiscent of the sort of shaping you see on other stealth aircraft like the F-22 or the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.",
        "It's a combination of, kind of, gradual curves, flat planes and the occasional - and a few knife edges where those join.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And from the picture, what functions did those extra bits of equipment or edges have?",
        "What were they on the helicopter for?",
        "Well, you could see, really, two sets of things.",
        "One was a tail rotor that was modified with more blades than usual, which is - which you would do to make the helicopter quieter and make its noise less obtrusive, to take some of the very strong beats out of the helicopter's noise signature.",
        "How would that be accomplished?",
        "Well, the sort of beats you hear when you hear a helicopter, the sort of rhythmic pounding..."
