        "Up next, our Valentine's Day gift to you: the science of kissing.",
        "I know, you're saying science, you're saying kissing.",
        "Kissing is an art, not a science, right?",
        "Well, my next guest has written a book called \"\"The Science of Kissing,\"\" which covers not only osculation - there's the word for today - the scientific word for kissing - but its history and all kinds of stuff having to do with kissing, when and why did it start, why did giraffes neck and dogs lick but we're the only species that kiss, besides bonobos?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Sheril Kirshenbaum is the author of \"\"The Science of Kissing\"\" and research associate at the Center for International Energy and Environmental Policy at the University of Texas at Austin.",

        "Hi, Ira.",

        "Well, I hope they kiss more.",
        "That's definitely something good for us.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "Oh, it's great for us.",
        "I think more than anything it firms up our relationships.",

        "Yeah.",

        "At Lafayette, two endocrinologists were interested in the way hormones changed, both oxytocin, the love hormone, and cortisol, known as the stress hormone.",
        "They invited student volunteers into their laboratory, had them - well, actually into their health facility, had them make out and prodded them with needles and had them spit in a cup and measured how things were changing in their bodies.",
        "I'll bet you they had - they paid them to do that.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I think it was pretty much a volunteer basis, but the funny thing about that experiment was the results weren't quite what they expected.",
        "And then over time it dawned on them that maybe a health center and being poked with needles wasn't the most relaxed environment and that might have had something to do with it.",
        "So they re-did the experiment in a dark quiet room with candlelight and music...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...and had some different results.",
        "That or the back of a movie theater somewhere...",

        "You know, what surprised me most writing this book was how little research has gone into study the science of kissing, because it's a near universal behavior so many of us can relate to, and we spend so much time and energy studying behaviors in other species, like foraging behavior in birds, like ants carrying leaves, which are also interesting, but why not put the microscope under, you know, to ourselves.",
        "And so there isn't any kind of taxonomy, like there would be in most things that scientists would study.",
        "But in - for the purpose of my book, I defined a kiss as pressing of one's lips to another, well, to someone else's lips or body part or even an object.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "We're talking about the science of kissing with Sheril Kirshenbaum.",
        "Is it true that we are the only species that kisses?",
        "That is a great question.",
        "Well, scientists have to be very careful when we want to talk about the emotions and the motivations of other species, because we can't pretend to know what drives them.",
        "So instead of words like love, we'll say things like mate selection or selective perceptivity.",
        "But then when you look around the animal kingdom, that said, we see a lot of behaviors that look a lot like kissing.",
        "As mentioned before, bonobos have been spotted to suck on each other's tongues for about 12 minutes straight.",
        "We see turtles tapping heads, giraffes entwining their necks.",
        "I have a dog.",
        "Dogs will lick any noun - you know, person, place or thing.",
        "Right.",
        "So we see a lot of similar-looking behaviors, and if we're willing to broaden the definition of kissing to this kissing-like behavior, which is actually what Charles Darwin did, then I think that we can say that we do see similar behaviors in other species for reasons from affection to grooming to social hierarchy to conflict.",
        "Is there any way to pin down how long human beings have been -when they first started kissing?",
        "Well, the earliest literary evidence we have for kissing dates back to India's (unintelligible) Sanskrit texts, which are about 3,500 years old.",
        "But I would suspect, especially given all of these behaviors that I was talking about across the animal kingdom, humans have probably been connecting in some kind of similar way for as long as we've been here."

        "And are our lips, I mean, designed for a special function like kissing?",
        "Well, our lips are packed with sensitive nerve endings, so even the slightest brush sends a cascade of signals and information to our brains, and the amount of our brains associated with lip stimulation - sort of the brain's-eye view of the body in terms of touch - is enormous.",
        "It's very disproportionate to other organs.",
        "So in that way our lips are our almost exposed erogenous zones, and they're really our way of interpreting the world.",
        "And for all sort of reasons, we're drawn to another person's lips.",
        "It's a wonderful example of a behavior that's both nature and nurture.",
        "So humans seem to have this instinctive drive to connect with someone this way, but it's also very much influenced by our culture and personal experiences.",
        "It's interesting, you talked about Bonobos.",
        "And we know Bonobos to be among the most affectionate animals.",
        "They are quite amorous, yes.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so they - and they're sort of doing their own kind of kissing there too, that's interesting.",

        "Is that right?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Although human lips are uniquely averted so they purse outwardly.",
        "And they're probably more sensitive than other species.",
        "So in species like chimpanzees, which also kiss, they're probably not as sensitive and it's almost more like a hug (unintelligible).",

        "Do we give off any, you know, pheromones, any odors that start - might want us to kiss somebody?",
        "Two parts to that question.",
        "So scent plays a very big role in kissing.",
        "When we're kissing someone, we're engaging all of our senses.",
        "So rather than just getting visual information up until that point, all of a sudden our noses play a big role, our sense of taste, our touch."

        "It's a perfect opportunity to get that sample and to sense whether this might be a good match for us.",
