        "I mean, what makes a good kisser?",
        "Oh, there's so much involved.",
        "I mean, there's things that we can and can't control.",
        "So a good kiss is very much about the individuals involved, understanding kind of the needs and desires of the other person.",
        "But environment is so important.",
        "I mean, a kiss that takes place when two people are feeling very comfortable is going to feel very different than a kiss happening - there was bad timing or someone feels a lot of pressure, because then you're going to have this stress hormone, this cortisol, in your body, and kissing and cortisol don't mix.",
        "But there are a whole bunch of different factors.",
        "And also, even if this sort of natural scent can play a role well beyond our control, but it tells our body a lot of information about whether to pursue a deeper relationship or maybe look elsewhere.",
        "And, in fact, 59 percent of men, 66 percent of women, say they've ended a budding relationship because of a bad first kiss.",
        "So we're really, really paying attention to what's going on.",
        "Not always, again, consciously, but it matters.",
        "It's a really significant moment in our lives.",
        "It creates extremely vivid memory for us to go back to and sort of figure out what's going on.",
        "Here's a tweet from Brian(ph) in Stockdale(ph), who says: Any research on the healing powers of a kiss?",
        "My wife kisses my booboos and it feels better.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I love that question, Brian.",
        "Well, no research specifically on I guess correlation with healing.",
        "But kissing is associated with feelings of attachment, of really firming up an important relationship that you have.",
        "So when you're around someone you love, you're very comforted.",
        "There have been studies that people seem to experience a lesser degree of pain when they're holding the hand of a husband or wife.",
