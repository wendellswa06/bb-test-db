        "They had a couple more drinks together, and then at about 10:00 o'clock that night, that's where things get sort of murky.",

        "They sent some drinks over to Gibbons' table and then were invited over there.",
        "And then Mazzeo says that after that, as she was trying to leave later in the night, Jim Gibbons basically followed her back to the parking garage and sort of grabbed her, accosted her, and tried to get her to go back to his hotel room.",

        "She looked at me, said nothing, and simply walked away.",
        "I turned and proceeded to my hotel, and that's where I remained for the rest of the night.",
        "Well, so what do people in Nevada think?",
        "Well, Alex, on both sides there's certainly a healthy amount of suspicion about the woman's claims, because of her being obviously inebriated and the fact that she has decided not to press any charges.",
        "But even before that, a lot of people around the country were watching this race closely, because the Democratic Caucus in Nevada has been moved up to the number two in the nation, just after Iowa, meaning that whoever becomes governor - be it Republican or Democrat - will have an important role in who becomes the Democratic nominee in 2008."
