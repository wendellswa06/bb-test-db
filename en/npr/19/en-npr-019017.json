        "While the TSA inspects passengers and their luggage, shippers and airlines inspect the cargo that rides in the hold of those passenger planes.",
        "Much of this work occurs through the Certified Cargo Screening Program.",
        "Shippers who sign up become trusted and they can speed their packages along by following a series of protocols, according to Hans Weber, who's with a consulting firm called Tecop.",
        "Once you're a trusted shipper, you also have certain responsibilities for notifying authorities if something is amiss, et cetera.",
        "And you have the responsibility for knowing something about the people to who you're shipping for.",
        "This allows industry to police itself without the need for big TSA inspection stations.",
        "But it also creates disadvantages for smaller shippers, according to Michael Whatley of the Air Cargo Security Alliance, another trade group.",
        "They do not have the wherewithal to get the screening equipment put in place at each of their facilities.",
        "So, Whatley says, a shipper in, say, southern Illinois might have to truck his packages up to Chicago and have them checked out at the airline's facility at O'Hare Airport.",
        "That adds time and expense.",
        "And, Whatley says, the program also has limited capacity, so it leads to what he calls stranded cargo.",
        "They basically said if it has not been screened, it will not be put on the plane.",
        "Well, they're not screening 15,000 tons a day.",
        "If it gets screened, then it goes on the plane.",
        "And if it doesn't get screened, it does not go on a passenger plane, as of August 1st.",
        "But Congressman Ed Markey says industry always says security is too expensive.",
