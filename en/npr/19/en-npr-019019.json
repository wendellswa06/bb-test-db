        "Tell us what is new or I should say, perhaps, old in this toilet training practice.",

        "It's really very consonant with what used to be done in sort of Victorian and post-Victorian England and Germany and in the United States, which was the idea that children have to be sort of trained to go to the toilet, and the sooner it's done, the better the training and the more efficient it will be, and that was kind of the practice.",
        "Although, in general, people didn't pay particular attention to how well it worked, and I think the first time people began to rethink the question was in the late-40s when Dr. Spock, the famous Dr. Spock, wrote about this and began to question whether this was a good idea."

        "I mean, you know, people are always annoyed by having to deal with poopy diapers.",
        "There is a culture in equatorial Africa called the Dego(ph) in which, essentially, any child who is not toilet-trained by nine months, there is probably something developmentally off with the kid, so people think that it's possible to do it successfully in our culture.",
        "Now, you have what you call your third law of pediatrics.",
        "What is that?",
        "Yes, my third law of pediatrics, which I hope will someday make me famous, is this: the average age of toilet training around the world is directly proportional to the latitude.",
        "The further you go from the equator, the slower kids are to toilet train, and that helps us make sense of what happens in equatorial Africa because the further you go from the equator, the colder it is and the more clothes kids have to wear.",
        "The more clothes they have to wear, the less they're able to be independent in their toileting practice.",
        "So they've got to go find a parent, go over to a parent, pull on a parent's sleeve until they disengage themselves from whatever they're doing, then they have to sort of hop into the bathroom together.",
        "They have to get the kid undressed, and it's just so much trouble that kids just said, heck with it.",
        "This is just not worth the trouble, and actually, my third law has a corollary which is, frankly, more useful than the law itself, and the corollary is do it in the summer.",
        "Toilet train in the summer.",
        "Toilet train in the summer because in the summer you don't have the problem of all of these layers of clothes.",
        "In fact, if it's at all possible, just let the kid run around naked in the backyard.",
        "After a week or two of running around without a wet, poopy diaper, most kids are pretty reluctant to return to that state.",
        "There's powerful motivation there.",
