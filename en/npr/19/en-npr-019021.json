        "A recent study from UCLA found that 41 percent of transgender people had attempted suicide - nearly nine times the national average.",
        "That's why Greta Martela founded Trans Lifeline, a suicide hotline for transgender people run by transgender volunteers.",
        "As a transgender woman herself, Martela knew how badly it was needed.",

        "Most trans people end up kind of orphaned from their families and have to build new families.",
        "So to hear about the way that her family was rejecting her and working to isolate her, I think every trans person I know was crying about it the day that it came out, so...",
        "Based on what Leelah wrote, how would you have counseled her?",
        "We do get a lot of teens calling Trans Lifeline, and their situations are frequently really similar to what Leelah describes in her letter.",
        "I just came out to my parents, and they're rejecting me - that scenario.",
