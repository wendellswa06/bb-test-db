        "What did you look at, and what did you find?",
        "Well, so this was part of a larger project where I've been trying to understand the common characteristics of places with high rates of mortality from drugs, alcohol and suicide - these kinds of deaths of despair.",
        "And as you mentioned, I was watching the returns come in on election night and sort of noticed that the states where Trump was performing more strongly than expected, like Pennsylvania and Ohio and Michigan, were states that have seen major upticks in drug overdoses and other deaths of despair over the past decade.",
        "You know, I think in many of the counties where he did the best, economic distress has really been building, and social and family networks have been breaking down for several decades.",
        "And so I think these findings reflect larger economic and social problems that sort of go beyond drug and alcohol abuse and suicide.",
        "It's really about downward mobility and the dismantling of the American dream at a larger community level.",

        "I'm not so sure that it was missed, per se.",
        "I think it's been there at the forefront of the news for a really long time.",
        "I just don't think that we saw the potential that it would impact the election in the way that it did, insofar as it's tied up in these other economic and social struggles that are occurring within the same communities.",
        "And to be clear again, you're not saying that people that have a problem with opioids or drug or alcohol voted for Donald Trump so much as people who live in those communities that have been affected by it statistically in your study voted for Donald Trump.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "And I can't say necessarily who voted for Donald Trump, but we have to remember that addiction and depression and these diseases and deaths of despair go far beyond the individuals themselves who are affected by them.",
        "They affect friends and family members and coworkers and first responders and service providers and employers in communities who are dealing with the struggles of these and experience the same sort of frustration and anxiety that are associated or wrapped up within diseases and deaths of despair.",
        "You conclude your study by - I believe the quote is community level well-being played an important role in this election.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "So I think what we're seeing is the consequence of this perfect storm of decades of decline in these decent-paying jobs and benefits, especially for folks without a college degree, and little hope that those kinds of jobs will ever come back mixed with really easy access to pain pills and cheap and potent heroin.",
        "And on top of that, there's a lack of comprehensive and affordable health care services, including mental health and substance abuse treatment.",
        "Professor Monnet, what do you hope a President Trump can do to help people who live in communities like this?"
