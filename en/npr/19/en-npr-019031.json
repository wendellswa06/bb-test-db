        "troops.",

        "has been kind of dead-ended by being in control of Afghanistan?",
        "Well, I think, Farai, this represents a recognition by the United States that the situation in Afghanistan now needs to move, as one general said, from a point of where military superiority no longer counts to one where nation-building becomes more important.",
        "And I think part of nation-building - and of course as I said, this is just a transition - it means that you have to have a different face on the people who are doing the nation-building, who are both fighting the Taliban and then at the same trying to build the infrastructure of Afghanistan.",
        "I think there's a general consensus that with NATO now assuming a large part of this mission that you'll see faces from France, Romania, Spain, Turkey, Norway, you know, Demark, Greece, Bulgaria - other places.",
        "And that perhaps - because central to this struggle in Afghanistan is the ethnic conflicts.",
        "And so putting something other than just the American face on it has got to be helpful.",
        "Professor Berry?",
        "Well, I agree with that.",
        "But quickly, Farai, I must tell you that on the topic of Darfur you talked about, 20 years ago people in the Free South Africa movement, including some of your listeners who were kids then and some adults, helped to get sanctions against South Africa, which helped to crumble apartheid.",
        "What's missing in Darfur, after all that's said and done, is we don't have the United States moving for sanctions.",
        "Civil society and the protestors are stepping up, but we had partners then in the Congress who in fact acted, even if the U.N.",
        "did not.",

        "To defeat the Taliban is going to require more troops.",
        "The United States still has the largest number of troops in the contingent there.",
        "It's a good thing that NATO is taking more responsibility, but until we get out of Iraq and can send more troops - we can send more troops, other people can, to Afghanistan -I fear that there will still be serious problems there."
