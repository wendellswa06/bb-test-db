        "One is the inability to have a criminal justice system that allows people who are not hardcore violent felons to serve long periods of time.",
        "In other words, to make that a bit clearer, there have been a number of people in California, certainly around the country, who have argued that one reason our prisons are overcrowded is because too many low-level criminals are in jail for a long period of time.",
        "And California of course is known for it's three-strikes-and-you're-out law, and under that law there have been numerous stories about people whose - their third strike is a relatively minor, non-violent crime.",
        "I think a guy stole a pizza once and ended up in jail for life.",
        "Right, exactly.",
        "And so that adds to this kind of overcrowding.",
        "And the overcrowding just didn't happen suddenly.",

        "He ended up - he issued a press release basically welcoming these prisoners because it means more money for that state's prison industrial complex.",
        "Prof. Berry?",
        "It's a giant sucking sound if it works to places that need jobs for people to have prisoners sent there so that they can get these jobs.",
        "But when you look to see who's in the prison system and who's in prison, what that tells you is what the social problems are that exist that are unresolved in a particular place.",
        "Sure there are hardcore criminals no matter what happened would be in jail.",
        "But the fact that you have a drug problem and you don't have drug-treatment facilities for people, and people are put in jail.",
        "The fact that there is an illegal immigrant problem because you don't have an immigration policy that does anything to solve that problem means you've got people in jail.",
        "So that when you look at who's in jail - so what Schwarzenegger is doing, he's trying to fix the problem, what's on the surface, all these prisoners.",
        "And according to some lawmakers, he's doing it for political reasons because we're coming up on this campaign.",
        "But he's way ahead anyway, so I guess he's trying to solidify his lead.",
        "So it helps the people who get the jobs in the states where the prisoners go.",
        "It doesn't help the families who won't be able to see their relatives.",
        "It doesn't help the drug problem.",

        "One out of ever 136 residents.",

        "I mean we're talking about California, but this is an American problem.",
        "I think that the fact that crime rates have decreased, have dropped to levels not seen since the 1960s, yet at the same time, you know, we've had an increase in the number - the length of time that people are serving in prison I think has grown by 30 percent.",
        "You know, we've got just a time bomb here that's just slowly developing.",
        "More prisoners, as we said, serving longer times.",
        "They're aging.",
        "And then there's also the problem that happens when you have people confined in spaces like this, when they don't get adequate healthcare then they develop particular kinds of variations of diseases that come right back out into the public.",

        "So, how do you, I mean, on a political strategy level, Professor Berry, how do you deal with a topic like this, which has implications of race and class and power and, yet, given its due in a country that isn't always friendly to prison reforms issues?",

        "You don't want to offend people like the woman, although many of the women who catch HIV become HIV-positive and have AIDS have caught it from men who have been engaged in - of same sex relationships, so there's a connection.",
