        "Good morning, Scott.",
        "This sounds like a very ambitious plan.",
        "And even though Democrats will control Congress - do now - but will control it by even a greater majority, obviously, next month, how do you see a plan this ambitious and expensive being perceived with the government already committed to so many billions in bailouts?",
        "It's a question of speed.",
        "How quickly do you have an infusion of capital into the economy that really makes a difference in terms of helping to stop what Chris was talking about in terms of a spiral, a downward spiral?",
        "If you can put money in place that is guaranteed to actually be used right away - and this is what President-elect Obama was talking about to the governors on Tuesday - do you promise to use the money immediately when it comes to infrastructure?",
        "And the governors said, absolutely, we'll get on the ball.",
        "But from Obama's perspective, if they don't get on the ball, then people will say this is a long-term responsibility, obligation that could further drag down the economy.",
        "So it's all a matter of speed.",
        "Some other plans that he has, like a tax credit right now for companies that would create jobs - $3,000 for every new full-time employee - I think that's going to be well received, Scott.",
        "And I think you'll see the Democratic Congress act quickly.",
        "Let me ask you about that because Mr. Obama says they want to create good jobs, not ones that just might disappear - two and a half million in two years.",
        "What does that mean?",
        "There are people who will tell you if there is a bailout for the auto industry, those are not necessarily long-term jobs.",
        "Can you, in this economy, with technology changing the way it is, can you be certain that a job lasts?",
        "No, and you've got to watch political language here.",
        "You get President-elect Obama talking about creating jobs and saving jobs.",
        "Now what you were just referring to in terms of the auto bailout would be saving jobs, at least temporarily.",
        "But if you look at creating jobs, he's saying he's going to create, you know, all these jobs.",
        "Well, if you think about it, since Eisenhower's first term, we've created - the economy's created about 1.5 million jobs a year.",
        "Since Ronald Reagan's first term, about 2.5 million, which is what President-elect Obama is talking about.",
        "But he's also talking about saving jobs, and especially in the short term in the course of this recession.",
        "And that's what the auto help - they're not calling it a bailout anymore, but a loan - that's what it would do, Scott.",
        "Politically, what if tax cuts become necessary to support some of these plans - or tax increases become necessary to support some of these plans?",
        "Not on the cards, not in the short term.",
        "What we've seen so far, and the indications we're getting from Tim Geithner as well as Larry Summers, is that - this is the new Obama team - is that even Bush tax cuts will be allowed to stay in place into 2011.",
        "So he's going to - the president-elect's plan to cut taxes for 95 percent, that stays.",
        "But in terms of increasing taxes, that's out the door.",
        "OK, Juan, thanks very much.",
        "We'll talk to you next week about the transition.",
        "And by the way, you can hear and see Juan's thoughts about Governor Richardson becoming secretary of commerce by coming to youtube.com/weekendedition, all one word.",
        "Candidates of both parties debated one last time in Iowa this week before the January 3rd presidential caucuses there.",
        "The outcome of the Iowa caucuses has always been notoriously difficult to predict partly because of the distinctive nature of the process, also because voters there tend to change their minds right up to the last moment."

        "One person who has had some success in trying to read Iowa voters is Ann Selzer.",

        "Ms. Selzer, thanks very much for being with us.",
        "It's great to be with you.",
        "What makes the caucuses so difficult to handicap?",
        "First, you have to realize not that many people show up for these caucuses.",
        "We're expecting a record-breaking crowd on the Democratic side; that might mean a hundred and fifty thousand out of our 1.9 million, and on the Republican side, maybe a hundred thousand showing up.",
        "So you are looking to find people who think that they are on their way to the caucuses on January.",
        "Let me ask you about what's often referred to as the phenomenon of peaking too early.",
        "Howard Dean, most recently comes to mind.",
        "Does that really happen?",
        "It definitely happens.",
        "In 2004, we went into the field just six days before caucus day and we were showing, on that first day, four candidates clustered within 6 percentage points of each other - a very tight race.",
        "And by the end, we saw two candidates move upward; that was John Kerry and John Edwards.",
        "And two candidates moved downward - Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt.",
        "And I have carried this graph around to show the press.",
        "I refer to this as the Register Graph of Doom for Howard Dean because it clearly show there wasn't any way he was going to win on caucus night.",
        "But we did not know that just six days before.",
        "Isn't the real issue for you the ideological balance of the court?",
        "What makes you unhappy is that a conservative justice could be replaced by someone who is not so conservative, and that would change the makeup of the court?",
        "That's what bothers you, isn't it?",
        "It was noted that the debates in both parties, this last week, were pretty tame compared to some other appearances.",
        "To what degree do you think debate appearances inform the voters of Iowa?",
        "Or are they in the extraordinary position of seeing the candidates firsthand at the state fair in their communities, if nothing else, on the local nightly news so that they don't really need the debates in the same way the rest of the country might feast off of them?",
        "You get a chance to see interaction, get a much closer and time comparison, and really see how they are doing side by side.",
        "You could make a pretty distinguished list of people who have won the Iowa caucuses and then lost their party's nominations, couldn't you?"

        "To be perfectly honest, if Barack Obama wins the caucus, there's less of a bump for him than if John Edwards wins or Joe Biden wins.",

        "To stay in the majority, he has to ensure that other Republican senators keep their jobs.",
        "The math favored Democrats even before the presidential primaries.",

        "McConnell says he doubts Trump will hurt GOP senators that much, but he is careful about which Trump statements he will endorse.",
        "We could describe the rise of Trump as signifying a lot of things in the country, but one of the most explicit things is a rejection of Republican Party leaders.",
        "Do you see it that way?",
        "I don't.",
        "I think the Republican Party is at an all-time high.",

        "I think in this particular election, however, Republican primary voters are looking for an outsider.",
        "Well, let me emphasize, you're correct that Republicans have done extremely well in the Obama years on almost every level except the White House, and yet there is a situation where there's been a lot of discontent within the Republican base, people feeling that things are not getting done, and a lot of that frustration seems to have been expressed through Trump, and that's frustration in part at you, isn't it?"

        "For example, we put the repeal of Obamacare on his desk.",
