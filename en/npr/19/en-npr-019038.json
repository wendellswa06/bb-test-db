        "Well, by 1967, when the Court decided Loving, only 16 states still banned interracial marriage.",
        "What is interesting is that at the time the court decided Brown versus the Board of Education in 1954, ending the system of Jim Crow public education, the majority of states banned interracial marriage.",
        "And similar to what the court has done with gay marriage, the court then was unwilling to take on the question of interracial marriage when it first came before the court, two years after Brown, while it was struggling over the implementation of Brown.",
        "So it was only 13 years after the Brown decision that the court was willing, in 1967, to take on interracial marriage in the Loving case.",
        "It's interesting, though, because if you look at the states that did allow interracial marriage in 1967, most of those had done so for many decades.",
        "In some cases, they had never had any laws against it.",
        "This was not a fresh issue for a lot of those states.",
        "That is true.",
        "That is true.",
        "The lines had hardened.",
        "A number of states, you know, of the 30 states that had bans on interracial marriage at the beginning of the 1950s, half of them had gotten rid of those.",
        "But others had sort of reaffirmed their prohibitions on interracial marriage.",
        "And so by 1967, when that case came up before the Supreme Court at that time, they had no choice and were prepared to take on the issue.",
        "Well, that's an interesting point.",
        "It was clear, at that time, that the justices did want to take this question of interracial marriage on?",
        "Well, you know, they had wanted to delay it until the issue of Brown and school desegregation had run its course.",
        "And by 1967, we had had the passage of the '64 Civil Rights Act.",
        "And the '65 Voting Rights Act.",
        "And we were down to 16 states banning interracial marriage.",
        "And then the court was willing to act even though the outcome, legally, was inevitable after the Brown decision, a dozen years earlier.",
        "And I think you see the same pattern here, that really the gay marriage case was decided as a matter of logic a dozen years ago, in 2003, when the Supreme Court in Lawrence against Texas struck down the laws that made homosexual acts a crime.",
        "The court took that on when 13 states still criminalized that activity but they were unwilling to take on gay marriage, even as recently as 2013, when more than 40 states still banned gay marriage.",
        "But now it's moving so fast that by the time the Supreme Court revisits the issue of gay marriage you will have a majority of states, and a clear majority of the people of the United States, living in states that permit gay marriage.",
        "Does that accelerated pace play a role here?",
        "In other words, the states that do allow same-sex marriage - the oldest state, Massachusetts, it's only allowed same-sex marriage for the last decade.",
        "So would the court be less likely to rule on an issue that is so fresh?",
        "In Arizona, State Senator Nancy Barto sponsored a new law that prohibits wrongful birth lawsuits.",
        "She says parents should not be allowed to claim that the life of a disabled child is worth less than the life of a healthy child.",
        "You know, this issue may seem fresh but it's moved so fast.",
        "There's a concept called the normative power of the actual.",
        "That is, what is seems right.",
        "And, I think, what the court is doing is letting more and more of the country get accustomed to the idea of gay marriage.",
        "The court knows where it's going on gay marriage and, in some senses, known it for a dozen years.",
        "It's a question of timing.",
        "By waiting until more of the country has experienced their friends and neighbors being married and nothing bad happened, the less the court would provoke a backlash.",
        "And I think it does, and not inappropriately, influence the court.",
        "Walter Dellinger.",
        "He's former acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration.",
        "Mr. Dellinger, thanks so much.",
        "Thank you."

        "Scientists have built a customized chromosome from scratch.",

        "NPR's Richard Harris tells us the research involved the labor of hundreds of undergraduate students.",
        "Yeast have about 6,000 genes packed in 16 tidy bundles, chromosomes.",
        "Each chromosome is an enormous molecule.",
        "But Jef Boeke remembers the day, about 15 years ago, when a prominent geneticist named Ron Davis got up at a meeting and declared that someday someone would build a yeast chromosome from scratch.",
        "When Ron suggested that someday someone would make a yeast chromosome, I remember saying to myself: Why on Earth would anyone do that?",
        "Boeke was a geneticist at Johns Hopkins.",
        "Fast forward 10 years later, I bump into my colleague Chandra in the coffee shop, and we were talking about synthesizing this and synthesizing that and at one point, I said to him, well, you know, we could make a yeast chromosome.",
        "The technology's all there.",

        "At first, Boeke says he tried to buy some of the DNA strands they wanted to use from a company.",
        "But the first small batch took nearly a year to arrive.",
        "I realized that I would be dead long before the project could ever be completed.",
        "So it suddenly hit me that there were all these students on the undergraduate campus who would be dying for a great research opportunity.",
        "So Boeke and his colleagues put together a class called Build-A-Genome, and got undergraduates to do the painstaking labor of constructing long strings of DNA, segments of their yeast chromosome.",
        "And they now report success in Science magazine.",
        "They've built yeast chromosome No. 3 from scratch.",
        "To make it useful for research, they've deleted some parts of the DNA that they believe are not essential.",
        "And then we add a number of bells and whistles to the chromosome that we think will make for a more interesting version that we can play evolutionary games with in the laboratory."

        "They're interested in going after big questions, such as what is it in the DNA that keeps one species separate from the next?",
        "Of course, this deep manipulation of DNA also raises ethical questions about everything from patenting life-forms, to the potential misuse of biotechnology for weapons or other nefarious purposes.",

        "He says you might be tempted to dismiss this as a stunt.",

        "It's a milestone event in my opinion.",
        "If scientists can build all 16 yeast chromosomes from scratch, they'd have an entire set of yeast genes to tinker with at will.",
