        "It's part of the crust that formed a very long time ago, billions of years ago, and it's basically been stable since that time.",

        "And we had sort of an a-ha moment where we realized, wow, there's a lot of crustal helium coming out of Yellowstone, far more than we would have predicted.",
        "That's a type of helium produced by the radioactive decay of elements in the Earth's crust.",
        "And as the researchers report in the journal Nature, the amount being released by the rocks below Yellowstone is, quote, \"\"prodigious.\"\" - each week, about enough to fill a Goodyear blimp.",
        "Evans says this must be coming from a vast store of helium that accumulated until the rock started to feel the heat.",
        "The gases that have been trapped in those rocks happily sitting there for hundreds of millions of years is now driven out.",
        "You know, it's kind of an interesting thought to us, how these rocks behave because it's very rare on the face of the Earth to have volcanism come into rocks that have been that stable for that long."
