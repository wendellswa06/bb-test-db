        "Well, we asked people a number of questions that determines whether they are going to go out and vote.",
        "Have they given the election a lot of thought?",
        "How are they following campaign news?",
        "And we see the Democrats more engaged than in September.",
        "Forty-one percent in September said they had given the election a lot of thought.",
        "That jumps all the way up to 49 percent.",
        "The percentage saying they're following campaign news is 65 percent, was 50 percent a month ago.",

        "The problem is they still can't match the supra-energized Republicans.",
        "For example, 64 percent of Republicans say they've given this election a lot of thought, which is the highest level for Republicans we've seen in all the midterms we've measured since 1994.",
        "And if you're looking at the gap between voters, likely voters who say they will vote for a Republican versus a Democrat, you're looking at a pretty big gap.",
        "You sure are, because when you base the results on all registered voters, you have a small Republican margin, 46 to 42.",
        "When you look at the most likely voters, being very generous in what the turnout ratios will be, you still get 10 percent margin, 50 to 40 percent.",
        "This Democratic awakening that you're talking about, it sounds like what you're saying is it's too little and possibly too late, given how many of us are voting early.",
        "What are the numbers there?",
        "Yeah, the voting early percentage is as high as 27 percent this year.",
        "The problem there for the Democrats is if there is a trend in their direction, some of these people may miss it, because they've already cast their ballot in the somewhat more in the Republican mood.",
        "Some interesting numbers here too, Andy, about campaign ads.",
        "No surprise.",
        "I would think that about 90 percent of us say we have seen or heard an ad and most have seen many, many ads.",
        "But this is interesting.",
        "Nearly half of the people that you polled say it doesn't matter much who paid for the ad.",
        "And, of course, there's been a lot of talk about this, given the Supreme Court decision case, Citizens United.",
        "Yeah, that's a follow up answer to the question: Are you having trouble figuring who paid for these ads?",
        "And many people, if not most people, said yes.",
        "But people are kind divided over whether it was important.",
        "That was one of the surprising findings in this survey to me.",
        "Surprising, why?",
        "Well, I would have thought that there would have been a greater desire to know who put up these ads.",
        "Typically, people want to know and in this case they we're divided."

        "Well, it is very extensive.",

        "Did you measure that?",

        "Well, President Obama's approval ratings remain pretty stable, 45 percent.",
        "Not terrible, but not very good.",
        "Very comparable to what we saw with Ronald Reagan in 1982.",
        "We find somewhat more people saying they will be voting against President Obama when they cast a ballot.",
        "Thirty percent of them say they will be voting for him, 27 percent.",
