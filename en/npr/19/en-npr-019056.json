        "I've always belonged to a mosque community, and the mosque has always been a really important part of my life.",

        "Because he thinks how hard could it be?",
        "You know, I'll test drive this kind of new found practice in a small community, and then it'll probably go smoothly rather than in a big community, I think.",

        "Well, you know, I think what's interesting about the show is that it's a show about cultural divides and how the challenges of how you try to sort of cope with that, not only from a Muslim point of view and a non-Muslim point of view or even - you know, we got Lebanese Muslim and we got Pakistani Muslim - but also on the big city versus small community level."
