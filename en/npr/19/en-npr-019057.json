        "Between 1916 and 1970, African-Americans living in the South moved in waves from the Jim Crow South in hope of new opportunities to cities like Cleveland, New York and Chicago.",
        "The latest census data shows that African-Americans are on the move again, this time in the opposite direction.",
        "In recent years, surprising numbers of African-Americans packed up their families and moved below the Mason-Dixon Line and from cities to the suburbs.",
        "Jobs and a lower cost of living are part of the appeal, but there is also a cultural and historical attraction, a desire to return to places that previous generations called home.",
        "If you've made this move, why did you do it?",
        "How did it turn out?",
        "And what does it mean to your family?",

        "Good to be with you, Neal.",
        "And what kinds of numbers are we talking about and over what period of time?",
        "Well, I think it's really startling for the last decade, where we have seen 75 percent of the African-American growth in the country is in the South.",
        "That's much bigger than it has been for many, many decades.",
        "And we've seen for the first time the states of Illinois and Michigan show declines, absolute declines, in their black population.",
        "They've had out-migration before, but there used to be enough fertility there to keep the population growing.",
        "Now the out-migration is so big, even the fertility levels don't keep those gains going.",
        "States of New York, California also lost blacks this last decade."

        "So that's just one part of it.",
        "And of course, the other part of it, which you alluded to, is the movement from the city to the suburbs.",
        "You know, back in the earlier days, when the blacks moved north, the jobs were in the cities, the manufacturing jobs were in the cities, and there was a high degree of segregation, discrimination, very difficult to move to the suburbs.",
        "Now this last decade, for the very first time, just very pervasive movement of blacks out of cities into the suburbs.",
        "Twenty-one of the 50 biggest cities in the United States showed a decline of blacks.",
        "And for most of those cities, it was either a flip from a gain to a decline, that is it was positive in the '90s and now negative in terms of out-migration, or the out-migration was bigger.",
        "So really a very, I would say, kind of a historic shift.",
        "Is it fair to say: Goodbye Chicago, hello Atlanta?",
        "Well, yes, it's goodbye Chicago city, hello Atlanta suburbs, you could say, because even the city of Atlanta showed a decline of blacks and their suburbs ate up all of the gains of the black population there.",
        "And it's interesting.",
        "We think of the Great Migration, we talk about from basically World War I until a couple of decades after the Second World War.",
        "And these were largely poor people struggling for opportunities, as you say, in the manufacturing centers of the Northeast.",
        "It's a different kind of person who's making the return voyage.",
        "Yes, I think what's initiating a lot of this is a new generation of African-Americans.",
        "After all, most of the people who move in any period of time are the younger, adult part of the population.",
        "And the younger adults in this last decade are now a couple of generations after the civil rights movement, after those laws have been enacted, getting many more African-Americans into the middle class, into professional jobs.",
        "And a part of that is redefining where they want to live, and we find they want to move to the suburbs, just as many generations of whites have wanted to do, and into the very, you know, economically prosperous part of the Sun Belt, especially in Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Texas, in the South.",
        "It's interesting to look at some of the statistics.",
        "In Florida, Georgia, Maryland and Mississippi, white children became a minority for the first time.",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "And, you know, some of that has to do with the aging of the white population.",
        "So there are two things going on there: the aging of the white population, meaning fewer whites, in many of those cases a decline of whites under 18, and then of course the new resurgence of African-Americans.",
        "So that's also a different way of looking at things.",
        "Would Hispanic immigration also contribute to that?"

        "And is there an overall number that you feel comfortable talking about?",
        "Well, you know, I do think the fact that we have a lot of these Northern states showing declines in the black population, as well as California, which was another destination during the Great Migration, you know, that really, I think, puts an exclamation point on the complete reversal of what happened, you know, 100 years ago, 70 to 100 years ago as blacks were leaving the South.",

        "Georgia?",
        "Georgia at one point was considered a place where Barack Obama was going to be competitive.",
