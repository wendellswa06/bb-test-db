        "It lost congressional seats.",
        "You know, there has been a movement to the South in general, but amongst African-Americans, again it's driven by sort of economic necessity, it's driven by the recession, it's driven by the fact that actually older African-Americans, as well, are deciding to retire down south.",
        "So you have young people following their parents, young families following Mom and Dad to make sure that they have babysitting.",

        "I understand that because, unfortunately, the South has some history of segregation, and there are experiences that - there's a lot of support for a lot of African-American-themed celebrations and such in the South, where here in the North, I do find that a lot of things are sort of melded into one type of stream, which I actually find appealing.",
        "I wanted my children to have friends and experiences that were multiracial, rather than my own experience.",
        "I'm from - I grew up in Dallas, Texas.",
        "I went to an all-black elementary school.",
        "By the time I got to middle school, my parents bused me, through city bus, 40 miles a day to the white neighborhood so that I would have communication skills, and I would have friends and experiences that weren't limited to simply an African-American community.",
        "I guess different generations looking for different kinds of experiences.",
        "But as you point out, part of that Southern heritage is the legacy of Jim Crow.",

        "And I wonder, just following up on William Frey's demographic information, did they move to Atlanta proper or to the suburbs outside Atlanta?",
        "My kids are definitely getting an African-American experience that they would not have experienced in Portland, Oregon.",
        "What I'm saying is that African-American experience, they certainly have a lot more African-American friends there than they would have even thought of having here in Portland.",
        "But I get concerned sometimes because as they get ready to go into society, that sometimes people that simply grow up in all-black neighborhoods, it's hard to make that migration and it's hard to understand some of the jokes that go on in other communities on jobs and everything.",
        "And I really like the balance that you get in a multi-racial city more than what you'd get in sort of one cultural experience.",

        "And places like Atlanta, and even Nashville and Charlotte are becoming increasingly diverse and a real drawing point for sort of, you know, graduating millennials and generation X-ers who are starting new families.",

        "Yeah, in many instances - and that's what's changing the politics.",
        "You know, when you think of political candidates and you think of national campaigns, it's not just who's running.",

        "Where's your farm team?",
        "And when you have African-Americans moving from New York, moving from Pittsburgh, moving from Detroit and going to these Southern cities and going to college and deciding to stay, those people become city councilmen and then they become congress people and then they run for mayor and they run for governor.",
        "So, again, it is transforming the viability of minorities in these states.",
        "In another 20 years, Texas might be as comfortable a Blue state for Democrats as California is now, if these trends continue.",
        "On the other hand, when we saw a lot of migration of Italians and Irish from Brooklyn and Queens out to the suburbs in Long Island and Connecticut and New Jersey, a lot of those people turned into Republicans once they got outside of the five boroughs.",
        "Yeah, and what's interesting, I don't think that African-Americans, Generation X, we're not necessarily strong Democrats.",
        "You know, many people, when you see these sort of different financial problems, that's why you have more young African-Americans who are in favor of vouchers, more young African-Americans who are exploring different aspects of the Republican Party.",
        "So these changes are happening just like in previous generations."

        "Exactly.",

        "So I think, in some respects, as the same strip malls appear in every city, African-Americans are finding it less difficult to make these moves culturally than perhaps 25 or 30 years ago.",
        "Is there any sense, though, of abandoning people in the communities up north?",
        "This new middle class, well, that was the source of new prosperity in some neighborhoods in Cleveland, and Chicago, and New York and Pittsburg.",

        "I think what's happened on some of those cities - again, you look at a Pittsburg, you look at a Detroit, you look at a Cleveland and many of those cities, they have reached a saturation point for black businesses and black politics.",
