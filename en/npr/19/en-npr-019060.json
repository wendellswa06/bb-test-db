        "But it's just been really different for me, and I wasn't keen on coming back South, but work brought my husband here.",

        "So I'm in the process of trying to make this my community.",
        "But I have to tell you, it is much easier for people of means, because this is a driving community.",
        "So if you don't have access to a car.",
        "If you aren't able to get around, there's virtually no public transportation.",
        "And I find that just, you know, it's just inconvenient, but...",
        "Lots of things are a lot easier for people of means.",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "But, yeah, but again, it's been a good move for the family, but it's been a really interesting to kind of see my experience of growing up in the Deep South and the segregated South, and then being back, you know, in a large kind of metropolitan Southern city.",
        "Well, Jocelyn, thanks very much for the call.",

        "But Hilton Head, South Carolina - relatively new community.",
        "A lot of these suburbs relatively new places where there are not entrenched political elites, and new things can be established.",
        "Exactly.",
        "As I mentioned before, you know, new Republicans, new Democrats, people with different ideas, one way or another.",
        "And you also notice a lot of these budget fights that we hear going out in Michigan, and in Ohio and in Wisconsin right now, as people are fighting about cutting budgets for state resources, we're not hearing those arguments as much in the South anymore.",
        "Because if you start destroying the resources that people want to stay in a state, they're not going to want to stay anymore.",
        "I mean, you hear a lot of these people saying, I was going down because of a job.",
        "I went down because, you know, there might have been better schools.",
        "If you make those things less available in these older states up North, people are going to want to leave.",
        "And that includes African-Americans of means, like she just mentioned.",
        "But then the budgets can get strained.",
        "Obviously, if you're adding more population, especially more prosperous people moving in, your tax base increases.",
        "I remember talking to the mayor of San Antonio, who's had just a completely different experience than mayors in Chicago or Cleveland or Detroit, for sure.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I think that's one of the things some of these Republican governors have been missing.",
        "It's, like, you've got to attract people there.",
        "All the budget cuts in the world - it ends up being a vicious cycle.",
        "And you're going to lose people because you keep trying to cut the budget to attract them there, and then they see no social resources, so they go down South."

        "If Barack Obama pulls that, then the Republican candidate he runs against will have to compete in Georgia.",
        "If the Democrats do really well after the convention in Charlotte, North Carolina will stay in the Democratic column.",

        "And has the Republican Party been taking advantage of the opportunity - yes, to black congressmen from the South - but to recruit amongst Latinos and African-Americans?",
        "Yeah.",

        "In the speech, the president says we have to live within our means, reduce our deficit and get back on a path that will allow us to pay down our debt, and we have to do it in a way that protects the recovery and protects the investments we need to grow, create jobs and win the future.",
        "The president's address then goes into a lengthy history of, well, how we got to where we are, the ideal of a government that first of all lets its people release their entrepreneurial abilities through low taxes and small government but a government that also, and he quotes here Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, he makes a point of saying that, that has joint responsibilities for each other, as well.",
        "And he talks about the balance of those responsibilities throughout our time and then goes through a more detailed history of the late 20th century, of the deals reached by Presidents Reagan and Presidents Clinton to keep the government debt in balance, in control and achieve the balance of - keep the federal debt low.",
        "And here's the thing: I believe that most wealthy Americans would agree with me.",
        "They want to give back to their country, a country that's done so much for them.",
        "It's just Washington hasn't asked them to.",

        "Then the Bush - the wars were not paid for era and also the Medicare Part D, the drug spending program that was not paid for, either.",
        "And then he says he found himself in a serious situation when he came to office.",
        "And now that our economic recovery is gaining strength, Democrats and Republicans must come together and restore the fiscal responsibility that served us so well in the 1990s.",
        "We have to live within our means, we have to reduce our deficit, and we have to get back on a path that will allow us to pay down our debt.",

        "Why does this matter to me?",
        "Well, here's why.",
        "Even after our economy recovers, our government will still be on track to spend more money than it takes in throughout this decade and beyond.",
        "That means we'll have to keep borrowing more from countries like China.",
        "The remark about Joe, of course a reference to Vice President Joe Biden, among the dignitaries in the audience at George Washington University today.",

        "This doesn't have to be the country we leave to our children.",

        "And he says most Americans tend to dislike government spending.",
        "They tend to dislike - in the abstract, he says they also tend to dislike paying higher taxes.",
        "By the end of this decade, the interest that we owe on our debt could rise to nearly $1 trillion.",

        "That's the interest, just the interest payments.",
        "Then, as the baby boomers start to retire in greater numbers and health care costs continue to rise, the situation will get even worse.",
        "By 2025, the amount of taxes we currently pay will only be enough to finance our health care programs - Medicare and Medicaid - Social Security and the interest we owe on our debt.",

        "Now ultimately, all this rising debt will cost us jobs and damage our economy.",
        "Because all this spending is popular, though, he says, with Republicans and Democrats alike, spending on a strong military and strong defense, education and medical research, because nobody wants to pay higher taxes, politicians, he says, are often eager to feed the impression that solving the problem is just a matter of eliminating waste and abuse, that tackling the deficit issue will not require tough choices.",
        "Or they suggest that we can somehow close our entire deficit by eliminating things like foreign aid, even though foreign aid makes up about one percent of our entire budget.",
        "The president, in a sense, has been referring the debate that has been going on here in Washington the past couple of weeks over the current budget, the 2011 budget, where much of the discussion, indeed all of the discussion, has been focused on about 12 percent of the federal budget; the 12 percent of the federal budget that involves so-called non-defense discretionary spending, programs, well, like agriculture and programs like education and programs like Corporation for Public Broadcasting and Planned Parenthood and other things like that.",

        "It does not involve Medicare and Medicaid.",
        "It does not involve Social Security.",

        "As Willie Sutton, the bank robber, once famously said, asked why he robs banks: That's where the money is.",
        "And, well, congressional appropriators and congressional budget cutters have looked at those big entitlement programs - Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and to some degree defense spending, as well - and said: Well, if we're going to be reducing our budgets, that's where the money is.",
        "So the president argues that there has to be a balanced approached.",
        "He is highly critical of the approach favored by Republican budget - the chairman of the House Budget Committee, Republican Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.",
        "He says he takes a serious approach at reducing the deficit with proposals to reduce about $5 trillion over the next 10 years.",
        "But he said this lays out a vision of America that is not going to be one we may want to look at it.",
        "It looks at a vision of America where we're not going to be able to fix the roads when they crumble or to provide enough money for health care for seniors or provide enough money for the many millions of Americans who currently are without health care coverage.",
        "So the president says there has to be an alternative.",
        "But we must, he says, continue to focus on the kinds of programs and the areas of the budget that we have to focus on.",
        "And indeed the other part of the program, and he calls his balanced approach, is the idea that there has to be revenue increases in all of this as well, revenue increases that are going to involve elimination of the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, those who earn over $250,000 a year.",
        "If that debate sounds familiar, you'll remember last December, this was an important part of the debate, as Republicans and Democrats reached an agreement at that time to extend those tax cuts in the House of Representatives and the Senate and then get some programs that the president wanted, as well."
