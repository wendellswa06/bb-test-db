        "But he says it's important that you look at the part of the budget where the money is.",
        "So here's the truth.",
        "Around two-thirds of our budget, two-thirds, is spent on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and national security - two-thirds.",
        "Programs like unemployment insurance, student loans, veterans' benefits and tax credits for working families take up another 20 percent.",
        "What's left, after interest on the debt, is just 12 percent for everything else.",
        "That's 12 percent for all of our national priorities: education, clean energy, medical research, transportation, our national parks, food safety, keeping our air and water clean, you name it.",
        "All of that accounts for 12 percent of our budget.",
        "Now up until now, the debate here in Washington, the cuts proposed by a lot of folks in Washington, have focused exclusively on that 12 percent.",
        "But cuts to that 12 percent alone won't solve the problem.",
        "So any serious plan to tackle our deficit will require us to put everything on the table, and take on excess spending wherever it exists in the budget.",
        "A serious plan doesn't require us to balance our budget overnight.",
        "In fact, economists think that with the economy just starting to grow again, we need a phased-in approach.",
        "But it does require tough decisions and support from our leaders in both parties now.",
        "Above all, it will require us to choose a vision of the America we want to see five years, 10 years, 20 years down the road.",
        "President Obama, speaking at George Washington University today, as he lays out his ideas to rein in federal spending and get control of the federal deficit.",
        "I'm Neal Conan.",
        "This is special coverage from NPR News.",
        "And Mara Liasson, NPR's national political correspondent, is with me here in the studio.",
        "And Mara, when the president says he's laying out his vision, this is in sharp contrast to the vision that was laid out a couple of weeks ago by the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, Paul Ryan, who laid out $5 trillion in cuts but said then - and Republicans said again today - tax increases are not going to be part of the solution.",
        "That's right.",
        "The president has a very different vision.",
        "What we have now is a real debate about the fiscal future of the United States.",
        "The president has stayed out of this debate in a forthright way until today.",
        "And now he's jumped in.",
        "He spends a lot of the speech eviscerating the Ryan budget, trying to explain why their vision of America doesn't comport with American values and why he has a better idea how we can achieve the same goals as Paul Ryan without privatizing Medicare or shortchanging our investments in the future, the kinds of things he thinks will make the economy grow and boost the middle class."

        "What he does in this speech is he does embrace, to large extent, the recommendations of his own deficit commission, which came out late last year, and he hasn't embraced them until now, but he does.",
        "And he laid out quite a specific framework where he wants to get $4 trillion in savings over 12 years.",
        "He would have automatic failsafe triggers that if Congress couldn't reach that, get the deficit to a certain percentage of GDP, there would be automatic cuts in not - in tax expenditures and spending.",

        "We're going to bring you more analysis of the president's program, how it compares with the Ryan plan and get some political reaction here in Washington, D.C., from - well, those who are going to be trying to put these proposals, the Ryan proposals and the Obama proposals, into legislation and get them enacted and how this may play out in the election of 2012, where it's likely to be one of the key issues of the campaign, not just for the presidency but for Congress, as well.",

        "Let's listen in.",
        "...so that the amount of taxes you pay isn't determined by what kind of accountant you can afford.",
        "I believe reform should protect the middle class, promote economic growth and build on the fiscal commission's model of reducing tax expenditures so that there is enough savings to both lower rates and lower the deficit.",
        "And as I called for in the State of the Union, we should reform our corporate tax code, as well, to make our businesses and our economy more competitive.",
        "So this is my approach to reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 12 years.",
        "It's an approach that achieves about $2 trillion in spending cuts across the budget.",
        "It will lower our interest payments on the debt by $1 trillion."

        "It calls for tax reform to cut about $1 trillion in tax expenditures, spending in the tax code.",
        "And it achieves these goals while protecting the middle class, protecting our commitment to seniors and protecting our investments in the future.",
        "Now in the coming years, if the recovery speeds up or - and our economy grows faster than our current projections, we can make even greater progress than I have pledged here.",
        "But just to hold Washington and to hold me accountable and make sure that the debt burden continues to decline, my plan includes a debt failsafe.",
        "If, by 2014, our debt is not projected to fall as a share of the economy, if we haven't hit our targets, if Congress has failed to act, then my plan will require us to come together and make up the additional savings with more spending cuts and more spending reductions in the tax code.",
        "And that should be an incentive for us to act boldly now instead of kicking our problems further down the road.",
        "So this is our vision for America, this is my vision for America, a vision where we live within our means while still investing in our future; where everyone makes sacrifices, but no one bears all the burden; where we provide a basic measure of security for our citizens, and we provide rising opportunity for our children.",
        "There will be those who vigorously disagree with my approach.",
        "I can guarantee that, as well.",
        "Some will argue we should not even consider ever, ever raising taxes, even if only on the wealthiest Americans.",
        "It's just an article of faith to them.",
        "I say that at a time when the tax burden on the wealthy is at its lowest level in half a century, the most fortunate among us can afford to pay a little more.",
        "I don't need another tax cut.",
        "Warren Buffett doesn't need another tax cut, not if we have to pay for it by making seniors pay more for Medicare or by cutting kids from Head Start or by taking away college scholarships that I wouldn't be here without and that some of you would not be here without.",
        "Others will say that we shouldn't even talk about cutting spending until the economy is fully recovered.",
        "These are mostly folks in my party.",
        "I'm sympathetic to this view, which is one of the reasons I supported the payroll tax cuts we passed in December.",
        "It's also why we have to use a scalpel and not a machete to reduce the deficit so that we can keep making the investments that create jobs.",
        "But doing nothing on the deficit is just not an option.",
        "Our debt has grown so large that we could do real damage to the economy if we don't begin a process now to get our fiscal house in order.",
        "Finally, there are those who believe we shouldn't make any reforms to Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security out of fear that any talk of change to these programs will immediately usher in the sort of steps that the House Republicans have proposed.",
        "And I understand those fears.",
        "But I guarantee that if we don't make any changes at all, we won't be able to keep our commitment to a retiring generation that will live longer and will face higher health care costs than those who came before."

        "This larger debate that we're having, this larger debate about the size and the role of government, it has been with us since our founding days.",
