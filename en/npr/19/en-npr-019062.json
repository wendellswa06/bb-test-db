        "And with me in the studio are Mara Liasson, NPR national political correspondent, and John Ydstie, NPR economics correspondent.",
        "And, Mara Liasson, let's go first to the politics and the president putting himself, it seems to me, squarely in the center.",
        "A competitor, uh-oh.",
        "Squarely in the center.",
        "The White House strategy all along was to wait for Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chair, Republican, to go first, to lay out his vision.",
        "They took a lot of hits.",
        "The president took a lot of hits on leadership.",
        "Why wasn't he stepping forward to solve these problems?",
        "He was basically playing rope-a-dope, but this was their strategy, and you can see it working.",
        "He was able to eviscerate Ryan, in his view, of Ryan's plan and vision, and explained why it was bad.",
        "And then, he laid out his plan and why it's better.",
        "He said that he can accomplish the same goals as Paul Ryan without hurting Medicare, without giving huge tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires, and also while retaining enough money to invest in things like education and research and development.",
        "He did lay out his vision of progressive government, something the White House was telling us that he wouldn't do.",
        "He wouldn't give a Brookings Institution-type speech is what I was told, but I actually think this was a Brookings Institution-type speech.",
        "He said this is my vision for America, a vision where we live within our means while still investing in our future - where everyone makes sacrifices but no one bears all the burden - where we provide a basic measure of security for our citizens and rising opportunity for our children.",
        "The White House believes the Ryan budget is imbalanced because it cuts too much out of programs for the poor and middle class without asking the rich or the defense - the Pentagon to share.",
        "Well, one of the hits he was taking, John Ydstie, was that the president was ignoring his own commission, the so-called Simpson-Bowles commission.",
        "And how much does this accord with their proposals which, well, we're calling - it was a bipartisan commission that called for deep cuts?",
        "Well, he does, I think, in terms of non-security spending follow what the commission suggested, not as much in defense spending.",
        "He does not cut as much from defense spending as they do, but he does call for $2 in cuts for every $1 in tax increases to try to close the deficit and another dollar in interest savings would come to get this $4 trillion in deficit reduction that he's saying he's got, or is his goal, over the next 12 years."

        "And I know that you've just had a few minutes to look at it, but broadly, do the numbers seem to add up?",
        "You know, it is hard because it's not clear exactly what baseline they're operating from, but one question I have is the president in his original budget had one trillion dollars in deficit reduction.",
        "He's now claiming another four trillion, and he says that's on top of the previous budget.",
        "So I think we need to look more closely to see whether that's the case.",
        "Of course, you know, there is not a detailed map for cutting here.",
        "We don't know what kind of monies are going to come out (unintelligible) programs.",
        "The devil in the details.",
        "And this is a framework that he's laid out today, but a framework, I think, that he is happy to compare alongside chairman Paul Ryan's budget, the Republican proposal from the House of Representatives.",
        "The president saying all along he welcomed this debate...",
        "Yes.",
        "...and now he's entered it, Mara.",
        "Now, he's entered it, and also, he does really embrace the Bowles-Simpson vision.",
        "He also gave a nod to the group of Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, the Gang of Six, who were trying to figure out a process to legislate the deficit commission's proposals into law.",
        "I think the most important thing is not so much whether his numbers add up, but the fact that they have proposed this failsafe deficit trigger."

        "That's where the Republicans have drawn their red line.",
        "They don't want those tax cuts for the rich to expire at the end of 2012.",
