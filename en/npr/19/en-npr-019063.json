        "But just a quick reaction to the president's remarks.",
        "Well, frankly, I thought the president reconnected himself with the Democratic base and at the same time reached out to independents.",
        "He talked about some components that his debt commission had proposed that he embraces.",
        "And I think that he was successful in walking between the raindrops in terms of touching on issues that he realizes or points of tremendous concern with the Democratic Caucus.",
        "For example, when he said not in my watch, he completely receives my attention and attaboys because he is saying Medicare and Medicaid are not going to be destroyed under his watch.",
        "And that's, frankly, one of the big concerns that I have, personally.",
        "It's important for those, however, to keep in mind that the president will not have a budget up before us, and I think there may be some confusion out there.",
        "The budget that we are voting on will be the Republican budget and not the president's budget.",
        "What he is saying is I think giving guidance to the negotiations that will take place as well as when the bill comes to his desk, he's saying that there are some things he simply will not sign off on, and I'm thankful for it.",
        "Well, again, there's obviously a vote that's coming in the House shortly, and that's about the current year budget.",
        "And there's a deal reached last week.",
        "The president will sign that when it comes to its desk.",
        "This is about the next year's budget.",
        "In a sense, though, Congressman, isn't this about the next election?",
        "For some, it is.",
        "I would hope that the majority of the members of the Congress can vote on the next generation and not the next election, and that is that we're going to try to remove from consideration any of the red meat social issues from our budget."

        "So he talks about saving $4 trillion over 12 years.",
        "That's less than his own fiscal commission recommended and that's probably the least we need to do; what the fiscal commission recommended, saving about that much over a decade.",
        "So we're going to have to do more.",

        "The president talked a bit about those.",
        "If we were to aggressively get rid of all those tax breaks, we could actually dramatically lower rates in a way that would raise revenue, to help close the deficit.",
        "That is a pretty promising approach to all this.",
        "We will still fight to the end, I'm sure, about taxes.",
        "But I'll actually tell you the sleeper issue that's going to have a lot more fighting over it is health care, because Congressman Ryan has laid a detailed and dramatic structural reform to our health care systems.",
        "And the president has his own health care that we just passed, which does put in place some measures to control cost but not nearly enough, as I think is being acknowledged now.",
        "And so, we're going to have to think about how structurally to get health care cost under control.",
        "The president lays out a goal for that, a very aggressive goal,, of how we would keep cost not going so much but not specifics to fill it in.",
        "For three girls at their age living in the outskirts of Jakarta and then to play that kind of music and have such talent and skill, I think is very surprising."

        "And as you look at the process, one of the curious responses you have from the public - as they've focused on these dramatic days in the past couple of weeks, as we approach a government shutdown and as all of this discussion about the long-term deficit and the debt have surged to the surfaces, people are pretty - well, I'm not sure that nauseated is too strong a word.",
