        "We are set up for that political fight, I'm afraid.",
        "But it is such a serious issue, so the debt ceiling -we have to increase it.",
        "This is not - I mean, it sounds like a fiscally irresponsible thing to do, but these are commitments we've already made.",
        "And if we don't increase it, it means not paying the interest payments on our debt obligations.",
        "That causes a crisis through markets around the world.",
        "That puts us in a recession.",
        "That is not the scenario anybody wants to have.",
        "But on the other side of that argument, people - or the White House has been saying - we want it clean increase, nothing attached to it.",
        "Listen, if we stay on the fiscal path that we are on currently, we will end up with a crisis anyhow.",
        "It's just going to take a longer time to get there.",
        "So it actually can be used as an opportunity.",
        "We need to increase that debt ceiling, and we need to do it quickly as possible.",
        "We shouldn't even - there are all sorts of kind of trust fund juggling mechanisms the secretary of the treasury can do if he's forced to.",
        "We shouldn't even let it get that far.",
        "We should - well, we should have a plan ready for this weeks ago.",
        "But we should put a plan in place as quickly as possible.",
        "But there should be responsible things attached to that debt ceiling increase to help us move towards an overall total plan.",
        "If we don't have time or aren't able to put a full plan in place, we need to put the beginnings of a plan.",
        "And I think one of the really interesting things that came out of the president's speech today was talking about failsafes; mechanisms that you put in the budget that you make sure if budgetary savings aren't found as promised, automatic savings and changes to the budget will happen.",
        "That pushes members of Congress to make changes, and it makes sure that the ones that they put in place stay on track.",
        "So that's something that we, through a commission called the Peterson-Pew Commission have focused extensively on.",
        "And I think it's going to be a very helpful tool to keep us moving forward, to get this budget deal in place.",
        "And it could be a big part of that debt ceiling increase.",
        "It's a fiscal doomsday device so, it sounds.",
        "It forces people...",
        "We'd like to avoid that, yeah.",
        "Yes, indeed.",
        "But as we look ahead, if you could characterize Congressman Ryan's proposal as a maximalist position from the Republican side, something Democrats were not going to be able to swallow, but something the majority of Republicans were probably going to be able to endorse, could you look at President Obama's proposal today as the same thing from the Democratic side?"
