        "Well, it was - there was a draft in hand before the elections.",
        "I think that if the story was going to run, it would have run regardless of the elections.",
        "The editors' concerns were really irrelevant to the fact that there was elections and the timing was almost coincidental.",
        "We got beat up by the left certainly after the story ran, saying, why didn't you the story before the elections?",
        "It would have influenced the elections.",
        "I'm not sure that's true, first of all, but the election was almost a distraction more than anything else.",
        "And you got beat up by the right for publishing this story at all?",
        "And we certainly got beat up by the right.",
        "We got beat up by everyone.",
        "Yes.",
        "Who, at the White House, was calling the Times to say you really shouldn't do this?",
        "And number two, when you met with them and you were the barrage of VIPs, do you feel they were sincerely concerned about national security?",
        "Or do you think some of them were more sincerely concerned about the outcry if this came out?",
        "Because I feel that Americans have been kept in the dark on purpose by the administration quite a bit.",
        "And I'll take my answer off the air and thanks so much for your show.",
        "It's great.",
        "Oh, thank you, Jennifer.",
        "Just about everyone.",
        "By the time the story ran, we heard from everyone from the president on down.",
        "It was a total - I added it up at one point for my book.",
        "It was a total of ten senior officials, from President Bush on through Condi Rice.",
        "The only one who did not appeal to us, and we found out later that was a conscious decision, was Vice President Cheney.",
        "He decided it was probably best if he stayed out of those discussions.",
        "It might have been counterproductive.",
        "There's a scene that you describe in a story you did for Slate, and certainly in your book, too, about a meeting at the White House.",
        "Tell us that story.",
        "Tight.",
        "This was just weeks before the story actually did run in December 2005, and the editors, at that point, were reconsidering whether or not to run the story and were leaning towards publication.",
        "We were finding out more about some of the concerns within the administration about the legal footing and questions about the legal underpinnings of the program."

        "And the editors had made it pretty clear that they thought they were going to run the story and we went into a meeting, weren't sure who we're going to meet with, and went into the White House, myself and Bill Keller, the editor of the paper, and also bureau chief Phil Taubman and we're greeted, walking around the corner not sure who we're going to face, and Condi Rice and just about everyone at the White House kind of came out one by one shaking hands.",
        "It was sort of an overwhelming barrage of VIPs in the White House, all making the case, basically, that this was a vital program, and that if the Times were to run this, it would irreparably harm national security, and that if there were another attack, this decision would ultimately be part of the reason why we were attacked.",
        "And as you sat there, at least ,in the way you describe it, you were pretty convinced that they were lying to you.",
        "Well, I was convinced that they were certainly covering up the deep, deep doubts that we knew about the legal framework of the program.",
        "We knew, by this point, that there were deep divisions within the administration.",
        "We found out later just how deep those divisions were.",
        "Down at John Ashcroft's hospital room, yeah.",
        "There was a revolt within the Justice Department and we reported that several weeks after the initial story.",
        "I mean, you had 20 senior officials threatening to resign in 2004 over concerns about the legality of the program.",
        "We didn't know quite that much but we knew that there deep divisions.",
        "We knew there had been concerns expressed by members of Congress, those few members of Congress who had been briefed about the program.",
        "We knew that there questions about whether or not this was legal and yet we were told there were never any concerns about the legal framework of this program which, yeah, which convinced me that we were being misled.",
        "You also describe this as part of a process whereby you, and particularly the Times in general, the media, even more generally, was sort of taking on a new attitude following the aftermath of 9/11.",
        "Yeah, I think so.",
        "I think that in the first months, and even years, after 9/11, there was a hesitancy on the part of the media to aggressively go after stories that we might have covered before, out of concern about being seen as somehow hurting the war on terror.",
        "And basically it was all about connecting the dots and the media was part of that.",
        "The country was outraged by what happened on 9/11.",
        "The media, in its sort of citizen's role, was as outraged as anyone and the stories that got play and the stories that got the front page were the stories about the threat of al-Qaeda, about the threat of the next attack.",
        "The media was not looking aggressively, myself included, at stories about how the war was being waged and..."

        "Stories about how detainees were being, treated waterboarded.",
        "Sure, those stories were either not written at all or got very short shrift and that didn't really begin to change, in my view, until probably around 2004.",
        "You started to see - you began to see the media get its bearings back and sort of revert to its old, kind of innate skepticism.",
        "You know, the old joke about, you know, if you hear it from your mother, get a second source.",
        "You know, that was - that sort of skepticism had abandoned us in the early months.",
        "Nevertheless, you know, it's not easy to make a decision when the White House calls and says publish this story and it's a threat to national security.",
        "It's not easy to go ahead and make that decision.",
        "It's not.",
        "It was an agonizing decision for the editors.",
        "It was made well above my pay grade.",

        "But do you feel that this administration was more bent and more intent on controlling or having influence over the press than previous ones?",
        "Even though I'm sure every administration always had attempts at doing that.",

        "Well, as far as the first question about influencing the press, I guess I'd put it a little bit differently.",
        "I think it's certainly a hallmark of the administration, the secrecy with which it has operated, and the lack of transparency is something that historians have now begun to comment on, just this surge in classification of documents, the rolling back of the things like the Freedom of Information Act.",
        "The subpoenas that we've begun to see, against reporters.",
        "I mean, those all have a chilling effect on the ability of reporters to do their jobs and beyond that we - there are just many aspects of government operations we once took for granted about knowing that are now they are just much more difficult to get at.",
        "And as far as the second question about the motivations,",
        "I certainly take them at face value when they say the reason they wanted to keep this secret was because they though it would harm national security.",
        "That much I think that this was said in a righteous belief that these things should be kept quiet.",
        "I think that, within the executive branch, there is a much, much different way of looking at these questions than there is in the media.",
        "Mike McConnell, the director of National Intelligence, put it into words quite starkly a few months ago in an interview when he said the mere fact that we're now all debating this question about the NSA's spy powers in Congress and the media means that Americans will die.",
        "That's a very, very different way of looking at the question of open government and debate then the media looks at it.",
        "Let's get a question from one of our members of our studio audience here at the Newseum.",
        "Hi my name is Brendon Lull(ph).",
        "I'm from College Park, Maryland.",
        "And you reported the wiretap story without the protection of a federal shield law, which has now been passed by the House but not the Senate.",
        "And I'm wondering how the shield law's passage would impact your reporting on these types of stories.",
        "Oh, well, I mean, every reporter in Washington would love to see a federal shield law.",
        "We have some version of it in 49 states, but not the place we need it most, which is in the federal arena.",
        "And I think it would add certainly a comfort level.",
        "I mean, I don't think reporters are necessarily holding back, but there is a thought of, for both reporters and their sources, what it's going to mean when the FBI comes calling.",
        "And to have a shield law to offer some sort of protection for confidential sources would be a tremendous measure of protection.",
        "A shield law would, of course, do just what you said, prevent reporters from having to identify their sources under subpoena or court order or as witness before grand jury.",
        "Were you called up?",
        "Did anybody want to know who your sources were for this story?",
        "We have not been subpoenaed for this story, thank God.",
        "Not yet, but there is, of course, an active FBI investigation, a \"\"leak investigation,\"\" they call it, into both this story and the subsequent one I did with my partner Jim Risen, to a somewhat similar program into CIA examination of banking records.",
        "The swift program, there are two FBI investigations going on right now."

        "On a personal level, does it ever bother you that, you know, the public doesn't take to these issues that are really more substantive?",
        "It's pretty hard to argue the public hasn't taken to this warrantless wiretap issue.",
        "It's caused quite a ruckus.",
