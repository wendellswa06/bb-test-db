        "Thank you.",
        "There's some controversy over the Times' decision to publish this on a couple of levels.",
        "For one thing, the Times decision was, at least in part, triggered by the fact that your collaborator, James Risen, was going to publish this information in a book.",
        "And the Times may not have wanted to see itself scooped by its own reporter.",
        "Kotliar is convinced this act of kindness saved his life.",

        "At least 3 million starved to death while in German custody.",
        "Right, and I do talk about this in my book.",
        "That was certainly a trigger for the Times to reconsider, to revisit the question whether or not it should run the story.",
        "You know, Jim felt strongly, as did I, to be honest, that the story could have run initially, that the national security arguments were outweighed by the public's interest in this story.",
        "And Jim was considering putting it in his book, which he was doing in late 2005.",
        "But at the same time, the editors made it clear to us that, while they would revisit this topic, they were still not going to run a story that they thought did not get us over that hurdle of showing them why the public interest was so strong in this and that meant showing that the legal constraints were as strong as we suspected.",
        "And in the internal arguments, to the extent that you can go into them, the Times has repeatedly discovered that stories it held on to it might have felt better about publishing them in the first pace, this going back to the Bay of Pigs story.",
        "Right, right.",
        "There's a famous case of Kennedy saying he wished that the Times had published more about what it knew because it might not have been such a fiasco.",
        "These are difficult calls for editors to make and I think they - I've never been in that position.",
        "I've never been an editor, but I think they generally err on the side of caution, because they realize that, especially with the stature of the New York Times, that every word we write is scrutinized very, very closely, and to put something out there, you know, once the genie's out of the bottle, we can't get it back.",

        "I am just curious as to why the press always feels that it's the American public's right to know every little thing that goes on in the government.",
        "I mean, if you speak about the rendition program, for example, that's not our business.",
        "It doesn't involve American citizens.",
        "The only thing it's going to do is benefit us, and yet the press routinely finds out about things like this and just throws them all over the evening news, thus ruining a program that is designed to help.",
        "Steven, do you think Americans had the right to know that the government was eavesdropping on their phone calls and emails without warrants without any sort of authorizations whatsoever?",
        "I think they've been doing it for a very long time.",
        "Yeah, I'm not sure I'd agree on either point.",
        "First of all, there are any number of times, and I refer to a couple of them in the book, where we've come on to things that we decided not to pursue because we thought that they - there was compelling national security reason and it wasn't obvious why the public would care about those.",
        "And we immediately dropped the pursuit of reporting those sort of at the outset.",
        "So it's not as if we'll print everything, despite what the caller might think.",
        "And on the other side, you know, the rendition program is one that's caused widespread international concern or controversy we've had.",
        "We've had indictment overseas in Europe.",
