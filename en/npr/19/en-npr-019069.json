        "The prosecuting authority is a chain of command that leads, in this case, up to the president.",

        "It's the executive branch of government that brings the prosecution.",
        "There are ethical rules that limit what lawyers can say about a pending case.",
        "The fact is that in our system of justice, we give people the presumption of innocence.",
        "We give them a fair trial.",
        "If the government can prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, they're entitled to a conviction.",
        "But what they're not entitled to do is prejudge the case, poison the jury pool and create an atmosphere in which somebody can't get a fair trial.",
        "There was a similar situation in the case of Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who abandoned his post in Afghanistan and spent five years held by the Taliban.",
        "Now, Bergdahl is being sentenced in the military justice system as opposed to the civilian justice system.",
        "Does that make a difference?",
        "Well, from my perspective, there isn't all that much of a difference.",
        "I mean, the president is the commander in chief as far as the military goes, but he's the chief executive as far as the executive branch goes.",
        "Either way, there shouldn't be outside interference in the process by which a person's guilt or innocence is determined or by which a penalty is determined.",
        "And I would say this.",
        "Yesterday, I think the president said something along the lines of - that our justice system is a laughingstock.",
        "Nothing would better typify a laughingstock justice system than the chief executive undermining the fundamental principles that support our constitution.",
        "That's why we send soldiers to fight and die - to defend those principles.",
        "We have to be willing to defend them at home.",
        "Are there examples you can think of from previous presidencies where people have been asked to weigh in on things and demurred?",
        "Why isn't it - isn't - the university's disciplinary procedures, why aren't they sufficient?",
        "Well, I can think of one example where we weren't dealing with a criminal prosecution but we were dealing with the criminal justice system.",
        "If I remember correctly, there was an episode where a professor was arrested up in Cambridge, and President Obama said some things which he very quickly came to regret.",
        "This was an incident where police confronted an African-American Harvard professor who was trying to get into his own home.",
        "President Obama initially said police acted stupidly.",
        "And later he backtracked on those remarks.",
        "That is correct.",
        "And I think what he realized is that the power of that office is such that it needs to be exercised with great delicacy.",
        "Of course that's even geometrically magnified when it's in the context of a criminal prosecution, let alone one which is potentially a capital prosecution."

        "It has been a month since Maria struck Puerto Rico, and we're still hearing reports of large numbers of Puerto Ricans with little to no access to clean water, which means the possibility of multiple health threats.",
        "And on Thursday, we heard the state epidemiologists announce 74 suspected cases of a bacterial disease called leptospirosis.",
        "First of all, what are the symptoms that patients are showing?",

        "So right now, we've seen 74 cases, but quite frankly, this is leptospirosis season.",
        "Typically, there'll be a couple of hundred cases that is seen in the August-through-December timeframe during the rainy season Puerto Rico.",
        "But I think the thing to realize is that, as you can imagine, in the case of Puerto Rico after this terrible storm and disruption of infrastructure where people are potentially more exposed to the risk of contaminated water - and again, it's not drinking it as much as it's basically potentially wading in it or being exposed to it and having an abrasion or laceration where it permits the bacteria to get in and actually cause the problems - it would not be surprising to see a larger number of cases than typically seen.",
        "Well, given the additional complications to actually treating patients who are suspected to have leptospirosis, what is the immediate response like on the ground that you know of?",
        "Well, right now, we're in the midst of basically ensuring that even though it's been a month, we're definitely within - still in response mode by ensuring that we can kind of assist hospitals that may have a surge in patients.",
        "Our attempt is not only to save lives but to stabilize the infrastructure and also restore health-care services across the island.",
