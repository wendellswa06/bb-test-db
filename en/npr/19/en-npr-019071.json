        "There is a lot of interesting research now looking at using testing as a study tool, and that self-examination or even doing tests before a course starts are both very intriguing, interesting and possibly sort of revolutionary approaches to learning.",
        "What are some practical ways, then, that we can take some of this new data and apply it to our own learning methods like, say - so I want to learn Spanish - which I actually do - or I want to get better at photography - which I do.",
        "What's your advice for me?",
