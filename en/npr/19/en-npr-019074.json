        "in 1956, but then returned to Cuba where he was, quote, \"\"involved in an accident.",
        "There are other apparent discrepancies in Rubio's statement posted on his website.",
        "He says that after a few weeks in Cuba it became clear to his mother that, quote, \"\"the change happening in Cuba was not for the better, it was communism,\"\" which is why his mother decided in March of 1961 to return permanently to the United States with his siblings.",
        "Again, that's at odds with what Rubio told Robert Siegel two years ago.",
