        "It hasn't been really mass arrests.",
        "People have been arrested - generally a lot of the people who are arrested are held overnight, you know, roughed up a bit, and let go with a warning in an attempt to quiet them and intimidate them.",
        "At this point, it seems like both sides are kind of gauging each other's limitations and capabilities.",

        "So what have the demonstrations been like as they've moved from day to day?",
        "Well, these are very, very large gatherings of people.",
        "And it is interesting from what we understand that, you know, as the days have gone on these demonstrators have been gathering with increasing confidence and motivation, and less and less worry about the consequences of being at these events.",

        "There's a worry among some people that the government will wait for these things to die down and then one by one go after some of the people at these demonstrations.",
        "There seem to be some - I wouldn't call them ring leaders, but people who are experienced at organizing this kind of stuff.",
        "And they kind of do a little bit of crowd management, move the people over so that the cars can pass, tell people to stop and let the people catch up.",
        "And those folks, from what we understand, many are former or long time student activists, university activists, women's rights activists - and those folks are the ones who mostly shield their faces.",
        "Might some of these be activists who remember being activists in 1979, when Iran had a revolution?",
        "You know, this whole thing - although there's all sorts of people who are involved in this from all walks of life, especially the march on Monday and the one Wednesday, yesterday - this is a movement that is being driven by the young people who don't remember - they weren't even born anywhere near the revolution.",

        "Well, look, let me just be kind of carefully clear about what this is kind of about, in our assessment.",
        "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad represents a certain segment of the Iranian population - and perhaps maybe even a majority -of pious, lower middle class, - a very distinct segment of the Iranians.",
