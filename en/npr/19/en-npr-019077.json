        "And that worries Dario Ahnert, a plant expert at the State University of Santa Cruz in Eastern Brazil.",
        "The carbon is going to get back again into the atmosphere and more and more of the planet.",
        "Ahnert says farmers need an incentive to save the remaining forest.",
        "He hopes chocolate will be that incentive.",
        "Chocolate used to be a huge industry here.",
        "In the last two decades, though, plant disease and low prices for cocoa beans devastated the industry.",
        "Many farmers turned to other ways of making a living - logging trees or burning them for farmland or pasture, and then abandoning the used up land.",
        "Now Ahnert wants to persuade farmers to return to chocolate and preserve the forest.",
        "He takes us to see a friend who shows it can be done."
