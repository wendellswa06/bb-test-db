        "Well, I will tell her she has waged a wonderful race, and that I have no regrets about endorsing her, and that I'm doing what I think, in the long run, is in her best interest, President Clinton's best interest, Barack Obama's best interest, and the country's best interest.",

        "I agreed - not speaking for the commission, that just as a person, I agreed years after our report was filed that I would not oppose 20 percent of the delegates being named automatically because of the positions they held, and I don't think it's a bad system.",
        "I don't want to see the superdelegates taking the nominee.",
        "The time has come, it seems to me, to recognize that Senator Obama has all but gained the nomination, and concentrate on building a unified party from here on out.",
        "Do you think Senator Clinton made any mistakes along the way?",
        "And if so, what were they?",
        "Well, the only significant mistake that I saw was voting for the war resolution years ago.",
        "My guess is that she would now feel that was a mistake.",
        "Yeah, I think that made it difficult for her right from the opening shot of the campaign until the finish.",
        "Well, Senator George McGovern, thank you very much for joining us today.",
        "It's my pleasure."
