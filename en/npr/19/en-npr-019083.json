        "Would this Supreme Court ruling affect them or just Medellin?",
        "A broad ruling will certainly affect all of them, Madeleine.",
        "More interestingly, it will affect hundreds and hundreds of Americans, as I said, who possibly commit crimes abroad.",
        "And it even more profoundly goes to the heart of these very, very tough questions that the court needs to answer about the balance of executive power versus states power, executive power versus the Congress and the courts, and very, very fundamental questions about really the breath and scope of the president's power."
