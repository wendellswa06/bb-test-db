        "Well, there's no question that there are significant challenges that Haiti's facing.",
        "The magnitude of the disaster was absolutely tremendous.",
        "I think it's important to remember that this is the largest natural disaster we've ever seen in the Western Hemisphere, and it's given us the largest number of urban displaced people ever, with, as you said, 1.5 million people displaced in an urban setting.",
        "It's something that the international humanitarian community hasn't confronted before, but I think we've seen a very robust response not only from the U.S., although we've played a significant role, but also robust response from the United Nations and other major donors.",
        "And among the concerns is that tent cities are incredibly difficult places to live in, incredibly difficult places to govern, and sometimes, they turn into shantytowns - permanent residences.",
        "I think that's exactly right.",
        "That absolutely is one of the significant challenges, what we do with the large number of displaced people living in tent cities.",
        "Many of them are living under heavy-duty tarps that we provided, that provide shelter from the basic elements.",
        "But the big challenge is how we move aggressively and rapidly to provide more permanent shelter for these people, to protect them from the elements but also to rebuild communities and rebuild the lives.",
        "And there was hope in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake that despite the horrible situation, a better Haiti might arise.",
        "Is that hope glimmering away?",
        "I don't think so at all.",
        "I think, as we've talked about, there are challenges.",
        "One of the main challenges in getting people out of these spontaneous settlement areas is removing the rubble.",
        "The amount of rubble is extraordinarily high in Haiti.",
        "We've seen estimates as high as 50 times the amount of rubble that was created in the collapse of the World Trade Center.",
        "So we need to move towards moving the rubble, getting people back in homes.",
        "But I think one of if you think about what's a cause for optimism, there's still tremendous attention of the international community on the plight of Haiti, and the donors have pledged an enormous amount of money, and we've seen real leadership by the government of Haiti and the creation of an interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission that was patterned after the successful commission in Indonesia, following the Indonesian tsunami.",
        "So I think we have structures in place to really set priorities and lead a reconstruction effort going forward.",
        "Are you convinced that the moneys that you're expending on behalf of the United States are being spent properly and on the right things?"

        "Are they being I don't want to put too much into the word but competent?",

        "So nonetheless, we think that if reconstruction is going to be successful and sustainable, it has to be Haitian-led.",
        "So we've been committed to providing additional human resources to the government.",
        "We've provided funding for standing up the government buildings physically, in temporary structures, because it obviously takes a long time to build permanent structures.",
        "And we've seconded additional staff to the government to try and help them out.",
        "We've provided staff, particularly on the communications side, which the caller talked about, because I think she has a point.",
        "Communicating to the people is very important.",
        "And we've seen in some of the settlement areas where people had to be resettled a month or two ago, as in anticipation of the rains, we saw President Preval actually go to the resettlement camps and talk to people.",
        "So, we've been trying to provide the resources for them so they can carry out their critical roles, but it's there's no question, if you've suffered the kind of losses they did, that they'll be challenged for some time to come.",
        "We have an email here, this from Maggie in Eastpointe in Michigan.",
        "Several months after the quake, one of the roving gangs of criminals, mostly from the destroyed prison, murdered the leader of a great NGO, Pastor Louis of the Haitian Lutheran Missions, which runs an orphanage, schools and medical clinics.",
        "What is the security status in Haiti?",
        "What should the international community be doing to at least protect those who are rebuilding or leading the rebuilding?",
        "Yeah, it's a tremendous sad development, particularly because in the several years prior to the earthquake, we'd seen real progress on a number of fronts in Haiti."

        "A large part of the operation was managed by naval vessels offshore that were providing logistical support.",

        "military provided invaluable support - under the leadership of USAID.",
        "We were designated by President Obama, as the lead agency in this whole-of-government effort, and we coordinated with the military in repairing the port, repairing the airport, doing air and lift support for the commodities.",
        "They have departed in a big way.",
        "They are doing in the Gonaives area, they have about 500 troops, right now, who are doing humanitarian assistance, repairing and building schools and looking at bridges.",
        "And that's critically important in Gonaives, in the north of the country, because that area has been particularly susceptible to hurricanes."
