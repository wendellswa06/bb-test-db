        "We've seen Hollywood stars focus on Haiti.",
        "We were extremely fortunate to have former President Clinton as the co-chair of the Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission.",
        "I think that attention can help motivate Haitians to know that they're not in this alone, dealing with the largest tragedy we've ever seen in our hemisphere.",
        "And they need our sustained attention because the rebuilding effort is going to be an effort that will take many years to come.",
        "You can't recover from that type of devastation in a capital in a short time.",
        "The devastation was calculated to exceed the annual GDP of Haiti, 120 percent of the annual GDP.",
        "So that is it's going to be a long-term recovery process, and we have to - when Haiti is no longer on the front pages of the Washington Post and the New York Times, it has to stay front and center in the minds of those of us working to reconstruct the country.",

        "Right.",
        "If you look at especially the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area right now, you know, the streets are still choked with rubble, and you've got hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people who are still living in the precarious, spontaneous settlements that they hastily formed immediately after the earthquake.",
        "However, you know, it is the largest, you know, urban disaster in modern history.",
        "And it is probably important to note what hasn't happened there.",

        "And somehow, all of those people who were displaced from their homes did get some kind of shelter, food and water and medical services over the last six months.",

        "Right."

        "The thing that I walked away with was the spirit of the Haitian people.",
        "Again, I'd heard all the news and was worried about what I'd find, but when I got there, I found people that, at least just from the village standpoint, maybe not Port-au-Prince, were anxious to try to help themselves.",
        "We had volunteers with us every day that were not getting paid a penny but just invested their time in trying to rebuild their village and get back to a state of where they were.",
        "Very, very much inspired about the individuals and the personal level and the faith that I saw with people but was also discouraged about the stories that I heard with the organizations trying to work with the government and the government basically holding things in port until fees were paid.",
        "And that was the thing I was more disappointed in."

        "I really felt like the people want to help themselves, and there's so much potential with them, but then the government's holding them back and was petty and selfishness and trying to, you know, get everything they can from the rest of the world, in spite of helping the people that they're trying to serve.",
        "Will, thanks very much for the story.",

        "We've been saying for months now that we anticipate the emergency stage could last as long as a year.",
        "At the same time, as the emergency stage continues, we have already begun the recovery phase.",
        "In between the two of these, while we're still delivering water every day, while we still deliver emergency shelters because some of those tarps and tents are deteriorating in the hot sun and due to the rains, we're also moving forward with the very slow and arduous process of building some of these semi-permanent or transitional shelters.",
        "Semi moving from, well, obviously dangerous situations to semi-permanent?",
        "Can't we go further than that?",
        "You would hope so, and let me explain the process.",
        "Some of our some of the participants in this call have alluded to this.",
        "It's incredibly complicated in Haiti not just the tremendous amount of rubble that still needs to be removed but the land tenure issues."

        "In that same land.",
        "The American Red Cross, this isn't our country.",

        "It's up to the Haitian government to tell us where we can build them.",
        "And even then, how are they going to collect rent?",
        "There are so many layers to this, Neal, and so while we would like to build permanent shelters, that's going to be even more complicated because you're talking about something that can last ad infinitum.",
        "At least with the semi-permanent shelters, and we're really talking about structures that are built with timber, with corrugated steel, these are more than the tarps and tents that exist there.",
        "They can be disassembled quite easily and moved.",
        "I wanted to bring Deborah Sontag back in, this conversation about the land tenure issues, the earlier caller complaining about the government holding supplies up in the harbor until all the paperwork is properly signed for and everything else and perhaps a handout or two, does all that sound familiar?",
        "It does.",
        "I think the customs clearance has been really the major issue where the government could, you know, take a make a simple decision and speed things up.",
        "Immediately after the earthquake, they kind of abandoned customs and moved supplies quickly into the country.",
        "And now, you know, the relief and recovery materials are getting held at the port.",
        "And it's not just that there's red tape, which there is a lot of.",
        "They are also charging a storage fee per day, you know, for the containers that are being held there.",
        "So it's an income-generator for them.",
        "In other areas, I would say, you know, you had, you know, a weak or a developing government that was, you know, as devastated by the earthquake in terms of personnel and, you know, government offices as the general population was, and, you know, they're skittish about the same things their people are skittish about.",
        "You know, they don't want to make the wrong decisions.",
        "They don't want to put people at risk again.",
        "For example, they would like to encourage people to return to intact homes in their neighborhoods.",
        "It's difficult because a lot of neighborhoods are filled with rubble, but there are people who are starting to do that."
