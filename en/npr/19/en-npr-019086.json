        "But the level, the complexity and just the amount of obstacles there, it's overwhelming.",
        "I'm not going to be discouraging, but I'm a realist.",
        "I mean, the tent cities are - you know, it sounds like a tent operation.",

        "I just think it's a big order, and I don't think the government functions there.",
        "And I think that's one of the biggest issues.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "You know, but they have done things.",

        "And, you know, it was a preliminary structural survey.",
