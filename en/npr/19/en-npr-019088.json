        "And that's really important because these affiliates are the ones who have been increasingly focusing attacks on the United States; affiliates like al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula - that was the group behind the Christmas Day airline bombing a couple of years and the foiled cargo plot last Thanksgiving.",
