        "And if you talk to counterterrorism officials, they'll tell you one of the few things that the Pakistanis and the U.S.",
        "are agreeing on right now is a list of three to five key leaders who are so vital to al-Qaida that if they were killed, the group could well fall apart.",
        "And Rahman is considered one of the people on that list.",
        "It's kind of amazing when you think about it 'cause there are about 4,000 al-Qaida operatives around the world, which is the number most officials use.",
        "But if you were to take out these three to five leaders, the officials say, that might well be enough to make the group collapse on itself.",
        "So, if this drone strike really did kill Rahman, it's a really big deal.",

        "And in doing so, he altered some of the quotes - he says for accuracy.",
        "But the original writer of the profile, which showed up in a newspaper called The New Times, said that Zinsmeister never contacted him and never told him what he was doing.",

        "And John, can you give us an example of a before and after?",
        "Sure, in one example the original article attributed to Zinsmeister said, people in Washington are morally repugnant, cheating, shifty human beings.",
        "On the AEI website he said, I learned in Washington that there's an overclass in this country stocked with cheating, shifty human beings that's just as morally repugnant as our underclass."

        "When he was embedded, he observed the journalists and he said he - that they were whiny and appallingly soft, and a bunch of other things.",
        "And his comments, along with the one that he changed, were the subject of a spirited discussion at a White House press briefing, between Tony Snow, the press secretary, and veteran journalist Helen Thomas.",
