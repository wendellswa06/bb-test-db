        "And that speaks to some of the important differences between today's Richistanis and some of the old money, we'll get into that in a bit.",
        "But I wanted you to describe for us the difference between mass luxury and hyper-luxury.",
        "Well, if you look at companies like Gucci, Mercedes, Jaguar, these are companies that used to have very specialized brands that catered to the wealthy.",
        "As these companies have expanded and go on mass market creating what they call mass luxury.",
        "The wealthy, in order to differentiate themselves from everybody else, had had to find new products that show that they're truly rich and not just merely affluent.",
        "And there is a watch you described in the book, the crazy hours watch.",
        "Tell us what this is.",
        "This is a watch by Frank Mueller and I had heard of Rolex and Patek Philippe but I've never heard of Frank Mueller.",
        "And Frank Mueller is one of these brands that only the wealthy know.",
        "You have to be a member of the truly, let's say, 100 millionaire club, to really know the brand Frank Mueller.",
        "They produce a watch.",
        "It's a $20,000 watch where the two hand is where the six should be, the six is where the 12 should be.",
        "It's all mixed up.",
        "So it's virtually impossible to tell time with this $20,00000 watch.",
        "So in essence, you have to buy a second watch to truly tell time if you have a crazy hours watch.",
        "I love their quote from their spokesman.",
        "Well, we could easily sell more but then our watches would become common.",
        "That's right.",
        "And common is the last thing you want to be in Richistan.",
        "And the phrase that you used - that they used to describe someone of lesser wealth is clearly beneath their notice is affluent.",
        "Affluent people are not members of Richistan so I divide Richistan into three categories or three areas of Richistan."

        "But each of these categories is very distinct from the other and each group looks down on the other as not being quite worthy of whatever group they're in.",

        "Right.",
        "I called it pragmatic extravagance.",
        "They said they did a cost analysis of sort of square foot per dollar, and they realized that they bought a commercial wide-body jet.",
        "It was actually cheaper for them to buy than to buy a G5 or a G2 or a Citation.",
        "And they wanted to outfit this jet with twin California beds, and they wanted to put in hammocks and all sorts of crazy things.",
        "And, you know, today, again, having a private jet is, I wouldn't say common, but among this crew, it's not so special.",
        "So what we're seeing today are people buying much larger jumbo jets to outfit - for personal use.",

        "This was fascinating.",

        "And I was in the Ferrari dealership expecting a hedge funder to walk in.",
        "And sure enough, a customer walked in and he wanted to buy a Ferrari and I asked the dealer, I said, oh, can I find out who it is?",
        "So I walked up and it turns out it was a stonemason.",
        "And I just couldn't believe how a stonemason had raised enough money to buy a Ferrari.",

        "And they need stonemasons for all these work.",
        "So he had become, probably, a millionaire because of all the trickle-down from the hedge funders in Greenwich.",

        "Sara, does that…",
        "That is not unusual here in the Hamptons, not at all.",
        "It's astonishing to see that the shift, you know, how people who were - ordinary working people whose fathers were blue collar workers, who are now themselves living in grand houses, buying second homes all over the place and whose children walk around looking like the preppy set 30 years ago.",

        "And increasingly, those rich consumers make up the bulk of the spending.",
        "So if you look at the United States or Canada or the U.K., which are all he considers plutonomies, most of the consumer spending is driven by the wealthy.",
        "And so when you look into the future what stocks to buy, what companies to work for, what other companies that are going to grow in the future, companies that cater to the wealthy are going to be the companies that succeed in the next 10 years because this market is so big and it's growing so fast.",
        "So the distinction is - could be between a Wal-Mart and Neiman Marcus?",
        "That's right.",
        "And Wal-Mart is suffering and Neiman Marcus is doing great.",
        "And I think that disparity, as it's reflective of our larger economy, is going to continue to grow in all sectors of the retail economy."
