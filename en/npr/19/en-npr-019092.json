        "Many people today, given inflation, given what it costs to send your kids to private school, live in a nice house on either coast, go to nice resorts, you really - people say - have to have at least five, probably $10 million to be considered wealthy today.",

        "Why is that?",
        "It's because demand for these goods, whether it's the Mercedes, whether it's the house on the ocean, whether it's the nice Chanel bag, whether it's the private school, all - there's so much demand for these items that the prices are going up at a much faster rate than in the overall economy.",

        "Thanks very much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And what was interesting is that one of the things you cite in the book was a survey that said no matter how much money they have, like Chris, if you had a million, you'd thought, well, how much amount you need to be secure?",
        "Well, maybe 2 million.",
        "If you have 5 million, you thought, well, 10 million.",
        "In fact, whatever amount you had twice that amount was what you thought you would need to be actually secure.",
        "I don't know whether that's human nature or something about our economy, but it was so fascinating that no matter what level of wealth somebody had, it was always twice what they had.",
        "When you said, what would it take for you to be comfortable, how much is enough?",
        "And when you ask anybody that question, they always pick their current wealth level and at least double it.",
        "So even if you went up to $10 million, they would say 20.",
        "And economist says that's twice your wealth levels, probably the amount that you can reasonably imagine that you would have.",

        "I gave up everything.",
        "Come out to this new illusion and it last - the marriage lasted about 72 months because what I found in this mega-wealthy family was - especially the children of them - is that they'll have a car, they'll run the car out of oil and leave the car.",
        "Buy houses, not pay the mortgages.",
        "Buy clothes, not do the laundry, just buy new clothes.",

        "If you got involve with him in any financial bills whatsoever, you would be crushed - financially and emotionally and spiritually crushed - if you did business with him.",
        "Take over the company and either was done illegally, or done through financial manipulation and they would take it and the parties involved, literally, be ruined.",
        "Much of the wealth that I found that is derived - is from - is somehow manipulating others, you know, they get what they want and then leave everybody else just penniless and they walk off and have no moral or ethical scruples in order to get what they want."
