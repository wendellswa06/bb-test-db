        "But the transfer was not without controversy.",
        "Several dozen prisoners, including some foreign terrorist suspects, were kept in American custody.",
        "The prison at Bagram Air Base, north of Kabul, has been a sore point in U.S.-Afghan relations for years.",
        "To many Afghans, it's viewed as a Guantanamo in their midst.",
        "Six months ago, the Afghan and U.S.",
        "governments struck a deal to transfer control of the prison to Afghan security forces.",
        "But at the last minute, the U.S.",
        "balked at transferring those few last prisoners.",
        "To find out more, we go to NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, who's in Kabul.",
        "Good morning.",
        "Good morning, Renee.",
        "So tell us a little more about this prison, and why it is that the Afghan government demanded that it be handed over now instead of after U.S.",
        "forces leave the country, in 2014.",
        "Well, it's formerly known as the Parwan Detention Facility, and it's just on the edge, or on the cusp, of Bagram Air Base, which is north of Kabul.",
        "As you mentioned, it's been compared to Guantanamo.",
        "It's also been compared to Abu Ghraib in Iraq.",
        "Basically, key Taliban prisoners and terrorism suspects are held at this facility.",
        "Most of them are Afghan nationals.",
        "But the facility has had a lot of controversy.",
        "It's known for its lengthy detentions of Afghans, who are brought here without due process.",
        "There have also been reports over the years of detainees being mistreated and tortured, including two deaths of prisoners in Bagram, in 2002.",
        "So it's pretty obvious to see why Afghans view this prison as a symbol of American domination of their country.",
        "And while President Karzai embraces the need for Western troops here, he really wants this facility under Afghan control.",
        "He's made the future presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan contingent on that transfer,.",
        "And that led to the memorandum of understanding, which was signed by both sides six months ago, for that transfer to take place yesterday.",
        "What was it about these several dozen prisoners, that caused the U.S.",
        "to delay their transfer in this larger transfer?",
        "Well, no one will say exactly what the problem was, at least on the American side.",
        "But there certainly is concern about the Afghan follow-through on the agreement that was signed in March by Defense Minister Wardak.",
        "He was ousted last month by the Afghan Parliament, and there's some concerns, again, that - some statements, apparently, that came up, that made the Americans somewhat concerned that perhaps this agreement was not going to be followed to the letter by the Afghan side."

        "U.S.",
        "officials say that they won't proceed with the transfer of any more prisoners unless they are assured that the memorandum of understanding is being followed to the letter.",
        "And it's important to note, also, at the ceremony that an Afghan general said 12 detainees were being released after they reviewed their files.",

        "Can you give us some context here - just how common, how prevalent is this?",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, suicide is the - either the second or the third most common cause of death among teenagers and young adults, depending on the exact year.",
        "Sometimes, it's a bit ahead of homicide; sometimes it's a bit behind them.",
        "And the interesting thing about that is about half of the completed suicides in this age group involve firearms.",
        "Wow.",
        "And I know that the first question every parent is going to want to know is, how do we know when a young person is at risk?",
        "We're hoping that there are some pretty major warning signs.",
        "Yeah, the warning signs of suicide typically overlap with those of depression.",
        "So withdrawal from social activities; a drop-off in performance at school; a change in friends, withdrawal from friends; withdrawal from school activities, including sports or arts programs; a drop in grade; a change in sleeping behaviors; change in appetite - those can all be signs that a depressive disorder is coming on.",
        "And that's really the time when a parent wants to engage their child in a dialogue about exactly what's going on.",
        "Well, I know a lot of parents would worry - you know, if I ask my child about suicide, is that going to put the idea in their head, especially if they're young?",
        "There's absolutely no evidence whatsoever that talking about suicide with young people puts the idea in their head.",
        "In fact, in our research, we found that children and young adults welcome the opportunity to talk about suicide, and are actually glad that we ask, that we care enough to ask.",
        "Well, and so is there a particular approach that's good, or you just talk to them straight out?",
        "Well, I think it speaks to the importance of just having an open line of communication with teenagers, and just keep the questions coming; everything from how was your day to, you know, tell me the favorite thing you did in school today - and just stay in touch with them.",
        "And that way, it's easier to notice when worrisome symptoms begin to develop, worrisome changes in behavior.",
        "And that's when the questions and the dialogues need to become a little bit more direct.",
        "And if at any point, a parent becomes concerned that a child or a teenager may be at risk for self-harm, that's when they really need to get in for some expert evaluation and care."

        "Well, the initial phase of our research really sought to develop a brief, practical, straightforward questionnaire which would identify teenagers at increased risk of suicide.",
        "And what we were able to do is develop a simple, four-question questionnaire.",
        "And it's for use in emergency departments by clinicians - nurses and docs.",
        "And using this, they can identify kids at increased risk of suicide.",
        "And what are those four questions?",
        "In essence, the questions go to whether the child has been thinking a lot about death or suicide, and whether he or she has tried suicide in the past.",
        "And then the follow-up questions - which we feel are critical in this nature - is what is at that child's or that young person's disposal, to actually complete the suicide?",

        "We simply need to ask whether the child has access to firearms in the home.",
