        "And we may want the speed limit to be 55, but the Supreme Court said it's going to be 70, and we're not going to be left in the dust as Karl Rove and the Koch brothers go rolling down the street, spending hundreds of millions of dollars advancing their right-wing agenda while we're overrun with all their money.",
        "So you're essentially saying you believe the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court was bad, but it was decided upon, and we're going to take part in this environment.",
        "To paraphrase Don Rumsfeld, you go into an election with the rules that you have, not the rules that you wish you had.",

        "If you disagree, obviously, with Bill Burton's group and the philosophy of some of these Democrats like Harold Ickes, who basically want to copy Karl Rove's model, what would you rather see Democrats do to counter some of the money coming into these conservative groups for the 2012 election?",
        "If we just look like we're part of this whole crowd with the oil companies and Wall Street and corporations looking for tax cuts for the wealthy, people are going to look somewhere else, or they're going to sit on their hands.",
