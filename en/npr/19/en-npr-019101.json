        "Three years ago, the Supreme Court ruled by a narrow five-to-four vote that a public high school coach could sue for retaliation after he was fired for complaining to superiors about unequal facilities for the girl's basketball team.",
        "If retaliation claims were not permitted, the court said, the federal law barring gender discrimination in athletics at publicly funded schools would unravel, because teachers and coaches would be intimidated into silence and discrimination would be allowed to fester.",

        "And so experts see the state of retaliation appeals the justices have agreed to hear as a test of whether the newly constituted court is ready to reverse course and undermine retaliation claims in other areas, like employment law.",

        "In 2004, the Justice Department sued the chain, alleging a pattern of discriminatory practices against customers.",
        "The chain, without admitting wrongdoing, settled the suit and agreed to a tough monitoring program in customer services.",
        "Today's case involved not customer services, but employment practices.",

        "The central figure in the suit, Rick Humphries, had high marks as an assistant manager for over two years.",
        "But when his boss left for another job, Humphries complained that the new boss made racist remarks, including one…",

        "When Humphries complained to higher ups, he says he began to get bad ratings and reports.",

        "He was fired on what he calls a false charge, that he'd left a safe open.",
        "Humphries sued Cracker Barrel for racial discrimination, representing himself.",
        "Because of a procedural error on one part of his initial filing, his only claim was one brought under and important statute that bars discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts.",
        "The law has always been a mainstay of civil rights law, and in 1991, after the Supreme Court limited its reach, Congress, in essence, reversed the court's ruling by amending the law to broaden its protections.",
        "The question before the court today is whether that law, as amended in 1991, includes a protection against retaliation based on race.",
        "Cracker Barrel asserts that the law that's at issue in this case does not cover retaliation claims."
