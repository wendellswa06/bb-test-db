        "Consumers may not be able to control energy prices, but they can take control of their own energy costs through smart energy use, and they can help to control their monthly bills.",
        "The call for energy savings is a departure for the Bush administration, which has been slow to adopt efficiency standards and generally dismissed conservation as little more than a personal virtue.",

        "He took pains to distance the administration's approach from that of former President Jimmy Carter, who famously donned a cardigan for his own fireside conservation appeal during the late 1970s.",
        "The situation that we are facing is a very different one than was faced in the past by President Carter's administration.",

        "Pedro, as an educator, I'm wondering if, in fact, when you hear these kinds of things and when you hear people stand up--politicians and others, often salute teachers--does that really stick to your craw, to a degree?",
        "Over time, those Gulf drilling platforms will be repaired, but Alaron's Phil Flynn says eventually the US needs to expand its supply of natural gas, either on domestic land that's currently off limits to drilling or through greater imports of liquid natural gas."
