        "We decided that the best way to look at the challenges, of course, was to see how we could fairly deal with the situation in light of the fact that we have two candidates and they are still competing for the nomination.",
        "The Florida situation was quite easy, when you think about what was at stake.",
        "And the reason why I say that is because Senator Obama's name, along with Senator Clinton's name appeared on the ballot.",
        "And we took the recommendation from the Florida Democratic Party to give each of the delegates a half vote.",
        "Once we secured the votes for that, and you saw it was almost unanimous, we proceeded to Michigan.",
        "Well, let me just say we did not have a resolution on Michigan and it took us a whole day of hearings to listen to the Michigan challenge, to listen to both the Clinton campaign as well as the Obama campaign.",
        "And neither proposal - the Clinton proposal did not have the sufficient votes, The Obama proposal was tied.",
        "I did not wish to break a tie, that would leave us with a 14-13 vote.",
        "So we went to the Michigan proposal, which had the backing of both the Clinton campaign as well as the Obama campaign, and that was the compromise.",
        "Now had we approved the Clinton plan as is, she would he netted nine delegates.",
        "Had we approved the Obama plan, he would have - it would have been a wash, because it would have been 50-50.",

        "So just give me the numbers.",
        "Who's got how many delegates?",
        "Well as of today, Senator Obama is the new number, the new metric to look at.",
        "Without getting into who has what numbers, it's 2,118.",
        "We added 92 more delegates that some were awarded, some are still up for grabs, because there are superdelegates involved as well as pledged delegates In order to clinch the nomination, you need 2,128.",

        "There are 31 delegates remaining at stake tomorrow in the two remaining primaries in South Dakota and Montana.",

        "No, ma'am, it will not.",
        "Here's why.",
        "First of all, the metric that everyone should focus on is who has the lead in the delegate vote.",
        "This is not about who is leading in the popular vote, or who won the most states.",
        "Which state carried more electoral weight.",
        "Our rules - this is a nominating contest, not a beauty contest.",
        "And so the rules stipulate that you have to win the most delegates.",
        "Now can Senator Clinton sue her argument that she won the most popular vote - and I'll put an asterisk behind winning the most popular vote, because here's why I believe a victory was achieved on Saturday.",
        "Senator Obama abided by the rules, and we said that Michigan and Florida would not count.",
        "He did not campaign in those states, although some argue that he ran advertisements, national advertisements, which, if you live in certain parts of the country, you're running in Mississippi, you hear it in Louisiana.",
        "You're running in California, you hear it in Nevada.",
        "He ran national advertisements and people in Florida may have seen it on CNN, MSNBC and whatever networks he ran it on.",
        "But the truth is, neither campaign, neither candidate, ran campaigns in those two states.",
        "So Senator Clinton, by virtue of the fact that we now have sanctioned those two contests, which as I said on Saturday that constitutes cheating when 48 states and the District of Columbia and other jurisdictions abide by the rule.",
        "We reopened the rules and changed the rules of the game at the end of the process.",
        "That's called cheating.",
        "But we did it because we wanted to achieve party unity.",
        "But now Senator Clinton is using the results of those two states to add to her total and popular vote.",
        "But they are now denying Senator Obama the opportunity to add any of the uncommitted, because we don't know exactly how they voted, all the write-ins because we don't know how they voted, because they are not tabulated.",
        "And they are not adding the people who actually went to the caucuses in five crucial states."
