        "But in a recent column for Bloomberg View, Megan McArdle says it's become easy for candidates and many of their supporters to exaggerate, even be delusional about how popular they are.",
        "Megan McArdle joins us in our studios.",
        "Thanks so much for being with us.",
        "Thank you so much for having me.",
        "Have social media platforms changed the way we define popularity for ourselves?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You know, I grew up in Manhattan and the funny thing about Manhattan was that you would get these Pauline Kael (ph) moments where people said, well, obviously no one's going to vote for George Bush or Ronald Reagan or something.",
        "I've never met anyone.",
        "But that used to be a delusion that was confined to Manhattan and specifically because the people in Manhattan were not only in this geographic bubble, but because they ran the media.",
        "Everyone outside watched television that came in from New York and understood that there were people who really vehemently disagreed with them.",
        "Now the way social media works is that it curates your content so that it's giving you more of what you like, what you click on.",
        "These are the algorithms.",
        "The algorithms, exactly, and the problem with that is that the curation is actually invisible.",
        "We don't realize that we're creating bubbles.",
        "Now, there are people who absolutely unfollow people who disagree with them politically on Facebook or so forth.",
        "But even those who don't, Facebook feeds you more of what you like and click on.",
        "Google does the same.",
        "And so it comes to seem that the news universe, that people who agree with you are much more ubiquitous than they actually are.",
        "And that leads us to the conclusions that - I mean, I've been informed by voters that every single candidate who's still there is completely unelectable.",
        "No one would ever vote for them because X.",
        "And it's not even that those weaknesses are wrong.",
        "It's that they vastly overestimate the amount to which the rest of the country cares about them.",
        "And, you know, having spent my time as a libertarian, being a libertarian means being well aware no one agrees with you.",
        "And it strikes me as very strange that suddenly we're seeing this phenomenon of people who really just don't seem to understand that they are a minority and not a majority in the country.",
        "You see this in the presidential campaign right now?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The number of people who have told me that Hillary Clinton can't possibly win because of Benghazi and the email scandals.",
        "Now, I agree that those are real weaknesses, but I don't think that everyone in the country cares as much as the people who are saying that to me.",
        "Similarly, the people who say Ted Cruz is a religious nut.",
        "Well yes, if you're live in Manhattan, you really dislike that sort of religiosity, but most people in America don't actually feel that way.",
        "They don't feel that kind of revulsion that sort of coastal liberal types often do.",
        "And you can go down the list.",
        "It's the same thing."

        "Even Donald Trump, who I think actually does have just incredibly strong unfavorables and really does trigger revulsion in an astonishingly high percentage of the electorate, even him, people are not as exercised about it as the people who are sitting around and telling each other, boy, do I hate Donald Trump.",
        "Boy, am I afraid of him.",
        "Boy, am I going to flee to Canada or France or wherever if he gets elected.",
        "That's a very local particular phenomenon that people are generalizing to everyone in the country.",
        "Doesn't, in one way or another, almost every campaign rely on the idea that there - the unspoken majority of people out there will support them once they get the chance to be on the ballot?",
        "You know, I think that that's true, yes.",
        "But at the same time, you know, Republican nominations always used to follow basically what you might call the Buckley rule, which is you nominate the most conservative candidate who can win the general.",
        "And very similarly with Democrats, right?",
        "What was John Kerry?",

        "We've got Bernie Sanders, who is pretty much the most left-wing candidate since McGovern who has - I don't think he's going to get the nomination, but he's put a really serious run.",
        "And on the other hand, you have the - now the plausible, kind of vaguely mainstream candidate is, for the Republicans, is Ted Cruz, who is by far to the right of everyone who has run since Goldwater and perhaps even more conservative than Goldwater in some ways.",
        "So this is kind of an astonishing moment.",
        "And I think that we have to look at how these bubbles that we all live in and the opacity of these bubbles so that we don't even realize that there are other bubbles out there, how that's shaping our electorate and what that might mean for our political future.",
        "I mean, we think we're getting news, but are we getting...",

        "Can you imagine, Farai, Compton now is a majority Latino city?",

        "This is an election coming at a very odd time for voters.",

        "She was 68 years old.",
        "She had just advanced into a leadership position, a chairman in the Congress, you know, part of this new, large 41-member Black Caucus, a real leader and a real trailblazer in terms of West Coast black politics.",
        "She died in April, as I said.",
        "And in this election that was held to replace her in June, you had a turnout of less than 12 percent.",
        "And you - this time, the election that was held yesterday, the special election was even a smaller turnout.",
        "So Richardson beat out former Congresswoman Millender-McDonald's daughter among others in the primary, but Richardson had a relationship to the congresswoman.",
        "What was their relationship and did the rivalry with her daughter threaten to ruin both of their candidacies?",
        "Well, it did.",
        "It did.",
        "That's a really insightful question, Farai, because what happened is that you had, you know, her working with the congresswoman as a field deputy for many years.",
        "She also worked though with Cruz Bustamente who, of course, was the speaker of the house out in California.",
        "And then all of a sudden, you have Valerie McDonald, who was Juanita Millender-McDonald's daughter, deciding that she wanted to run to replace her mother."

        "And I think the more, you know, stronger challenge came from the state Senator Jenny Oropeza who was Hispanic.",
        "And - the threat, the division though is one that inside the black community, if you had the black votes split between Valerie McDonald and Richardson, then you would have the possibility that Jenny Oropeza could have snuck through and you could have had the district flip from black representation to Hispanic representation.",
        "And let me say this is a nationwide issue, Farai.",
        "What you've got to understand is that there has been a leap in terms of the number of Hispanics in the U.S.",
        "Congress.",
        "They're now 29.",
        "It's been like a 60 percent jump over the last few years, so 29 Hispanics.",
        "And if you think about the 41 black people in the U.S.",
        "Congress, six of them already are in districts where black Americans are in the minority.",
        "So you have black people representing minority, majority districts of Latinos or whites.",
        "And in the case of this district, the 37th congressional district, it is now mostly Latino.",
        "And so the question was were you going to have a Latina come in, in the form of Jenny Oropeza or were you going to have - an African American retain control.",
        "So when you look at the legacy of Millender-McDonald, what does Richardson have to live up to for her community?",
        "Well, you know, this is another interesting thing.",
        "Actually, if you had had Jenny Oropeza or Valerie McDonald or Richardson, they all basically have the same politics.",
        "They're all pretty much liberal Democrats opposed to the war in Iraq.",
        "And so it's not a matter of a shift in terms of ideology.",

        "As I mentioned, worked for, not only Millender-McDonald, but for Cruz Bustamente, and got endorsements from Hispanic - key Hispanic politicians.",

        "And what exactly is covered by long-term care insurance?",
        "Well, when they say long-term care insurance, it's going to cover things like if you need to go into a nursing home or an assisted living facility or you need what they call custodial care, someone who comes in and helps you bathe or dress or helps prepare your meals.",
        "And so if you have long-term care insurance, it would take care all of the above.",
        "So who should buy this kind of insurance, do you think?",
        "Really, you need to start looking at this as part of your retirement plan.",
        "And as you're approaching your 50s, you need to start doing some research.",
        "And anywhere from 50 to 60 is where most experts will tell you that you need this kind of insurance.",
        "Well, because a lot of folks think it is covered by Medicare when in fact it doesn't.",
        "Now, Medicare covers some of this, but you have to - there are certain conditions that you have to meet.",
        "And Medicare does not pay for custodial care.",
        "Remember, I talked about that's helping you with daily activities.",
        "Now, Medicaid does cover long-term care.",
        "But as most folks may or may not know, you need to be low income and basically have no assets to qualify for Medicaid.",
        "So the fact is, most baby boomers or people in their senior years think that Medicare is going to cover it, and it's not.",
