        "At our schools, we try and support our teachers not only by training them in classroom management, but having a business manager at the school; having a student achievement coordinator who turns around the data for the teachers; having a dean of students to interact with all the families so that the teacher can really focus on being super well-prepared; having planning time so that she or he can deliver those lessons, and really get to know their students as learners.",
