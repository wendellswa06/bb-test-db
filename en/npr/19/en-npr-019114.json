        "Well, in answer to the first question - how does the secretary of the Army interact with the secretary of defense, his deputy and his various under and assistant secretaries - the answer, of course, is in whatever way the secretary of defense wants.",
        "There is some statutory authorities for the secretary of the Army.",
        "But in final analysis, the secretaries of the military departments report to the secretary of defense.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, this is a terribly sad to say, but so many people have died in Congo, and frankly, you know, the world is a bit numb to all of the violence and death.",
        "Gorillas have very high visibility.",
        "They get a lot of attention.",
        "They are ambassadors for the countries that have them.",
        "He said that the current round of exchanges showed a clear trend towards increased cooperation between the two navies.",
        "He called the variety of activity scheduled for the visit a breakthrough.",
        "They are responsible for equipping and training and leading and the funding of the respective military forces that they control.",
        "They are the only command authority for their respective forces in the Pentagon in terms of military justice.",
        "And they provide advice to the secretary of defense and the like.",
        "So that's in answer to the first question.",
        "They do have an extraordinary viewpoint from seeing both how a defense is being managed, and also how things in the field are going, because the chiefs of staff of their respective services report to them and are obliged by a statute to keep them informed on operations.",
        "So they get a good sense of how things are working, for example, in Iraq with our sons and daughters, how things are actually transpiring there in the - under the effect of gunfire and roadside bombs and the like.",
        "Now, you know, on a personal level, I have had a member of my family fighting in Iraq.",
        "And I can't be sure, but I would suspect, after seeing some of his platoon members die, he may not sign up for another tour.",
        "What's going to happen to the military as this war continues and as the troops begin to feel perhaps no less loyal to the U.S.",
        "but much more vulnerable than they ever have?",
        "Well, whatever's going to happen, Farai, has already been started.",
        "We're already beginning to see the effects on families of deployments that are extended, of deployments that once they seem to be over and they come home, they find out that they'll be going back again, and sometimes for a third time.",
        "This obviously has an impact on the willingness of mothers, especially mothers, to agree that their 17 and 18-year-olds in high school can be interviewed by recruiters and talked to about going over there.",
        "The fact is that you are trying to recruit the youngster, but what mom has to say, what the family has to say has an awful impact.",
        "This is not a lessening of the patriotism on the part of our young men and women, black or white or brown or red or yellow, or a lessening of their patriotism of their families.",
        "This is simply a realization that when all else is looked at, when all else is put aside, we care about those whom we have brought into this world.",
        "It's okay for them to go and serve our country, but we want to be convinced that they're doing it for the right reasons and with the very best of leadership and with the very best of support and equipment and oversight of the policies that keep them there.",
        "That's the effect on recruiting.",
        "It doesn't mean that people are less likely to go, but it does mean that families worry more, and when they worry, their youngsters take a little bit longer to make up their minds to go.",
        "And often they don't decide to remain afterwards if the policies require them to concede that they may have to go back again and again.",
        "Finally and briefly, what do you see Bob Gates's nomination meaning?",
        "What does it mean about the direction that the military's going to take?",
        "We only - we have less than a minute, but let me know your brief thoughts."

        "There are several things.",
        "Analysts are already looking at the fact, of course, that Bob Gates is from the inner circle of Bush 41.",
        "That is, he was there at the Agency, he did several things in the White House, and the like.",
        "Secondly, Bob Gates has a very different background, and he came up in national security.",
        "He was a careerist at the CIA.",
        "And so whatever that little appearance of a war or a distrust or an uncertainty between the Pentagon under Rumsfeld and the intelligence agencies may have been, we can expect that to be mended and perhaps for intelligence to be used in a more unified way.",
        "Relationships amongst the national security team should be better, and of course, as always, this gives a chance - the president a chance to go forward with a different policy in Iraq.",
        "Well, Secretary West, we thank you for joining us and look forward to having you on again.",

        "I think this is probably much more local than that.",
        "It may simply be that they want local, political authorities to pay more attention, and so therefore they go and kill gorillas, not for the global attention, but because they want someone locally to pay attention to them.",
