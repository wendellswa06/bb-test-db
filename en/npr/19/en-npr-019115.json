        "Well, we don't know quite yet how things will change.",
        "What we do know is the American government has withheld $300 million from Pakistan to go after the Haqqani network and other militant groups.",
        "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joe Dunford and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are going to be in Pakistan talking to Pakistani leaders about the efforts to go after some of these groups.",

        "We want to talk about a panel that was convened within the last week or so by the U.S.",
        "Commission on Civil Rights, to examine the educational effectiveness of historically black colleges and universities.",
        "The panel concluded that HBCUs are vital in providing the foundation for career success among disadvantaged minorities.",
        "But many on the panel were concerned that the debate post-segregation America continues over whether or not historically black colleges, in fact, should remain.",
        "One of the panelists suggested that the biggest threat, the greatest threat, facing HBCUs, is the illegal duplication of existing academic programs by nearby, predominantly white, institutions.",
        "Pedro, we should note that this kind of duplication has been done before, and what it does is that it leaves academic programs under-funded.",
        "And it also violates an equal protection provision in the 1964 Civil Rights Act.",
        "You deal with these kinds of issues all the time.",
        "Do you believe this to be one of--or as the panel says--the greatest threat to HBCUs?",
        "Well, I think it's clearly a threat because many of these other institutions have much more financial support and can provide greater assistance to their students, which places the HBCUs at a disadvantage.",
        "But I think the larger question facing the HBCUs, is their own financial stability, their continued ability to attract students and support faculty."

        "Many of the institutions are in real trouble.",
        "We saw one of the great ones, Morris Brown, recently experience great financial difficulty.",
        "So I would say, many of them are challenged.",
        "And I think the need to revisit the mission--who are we educating, how do we do it--is, I think, a pertinent one.",
        "Grambling, interestingly, had a white quarterback not long ago, which surprised many people.",
        "And I do think the need to embrace a broad diversity of students is one that the institutions are going to have to confront.",
        "Walter, when you take a look at the idea, as Pedro Noguera suggests, the financial stability of many of these institutions--save the idea that many people understood the importance the week that the telethon that the late Lou Rawls had every year, and sending in money--outside of that, I've heard publicly, and especially behind close doors, grumblings from these universities that they are not receiving monies from alumni or the community.",
        "It's a challenge.",
        "I mean, I'm and alum of Morgan State University, and we certainly have become a very stable institution, but still are faced with some challenges.",
        "In fact, duplication is one of them.",
        "We recently fought the duplication of an MBA program.",

        "And over 50 percent of all graduate students at Morgan State are white.",
        "The graduate programs are overwhelmingly white, and they're been attracting people.",
        "So I think there are a subset of historically black colleges, of smaller schools, that are facing some financial difficulties.",
        "I think alums often don't do enough, but we do have a number of very stable institutions that are on the cusp of becoming major institutions--black, white or otherwise.",
        "And I think what happens in a lot of these states, you have a lot of politics going on in state capitals that are now encroaching upon the ability of these institutions to realize their full potential.",
        "We should note, Tara, that there are a number of states, including Ohio, Virginia, Maryland, Texas, and others, who have been non-compliant in the idea of not duplicating these kinds of classes, courses, et cetera.",
        "I think what you're seeing is a consequence of competition, because you have--universities are competing for students.",
        "And on the shorter end of the stick, unfortunately, are the smaller, historically black colleges.",
        "I think it's important to recognize though, that this administration and the president, has been extremely supportive of HBCUs.",
        "He's recognized the diverse education needs that these colleges offer.",
        "And he's increased funding over 30 percent to historically black colleges for reasons just like this--for investment in infrastructure, for new technology, for development just to maintain long-term viability.",
        "Now, the flipside of this, is that there may come a time when some of these institutions may no longer have a place, to a certain degree, if they can not sustain themselves and can not maintain high education curriculums.",
        "And I think that may be unfortunate.",
        "This isn't about politics or competition.",
        "You know, it is about politics in a sense that most of these schools, particularly state universities, in these individual southern states, are faced with some very harsh opposition from state legislators.",
        "And regardless of what the current administration or White House has done, these schools have been under assault.",
        "And they are attempting to compete, but you can't compete when you're constantly under-funded.",
        "And which is why the administration has increased funding 30 percent.",
        "They recognize that.",
        "But it's not, it's not a, it's not a subtle issue..."

        "And quite frankly, they are so woefully underpaid, it's laughable.",
