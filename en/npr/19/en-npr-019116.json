        "And now, here's another attack on Catholicism, whether some people may see it as an attack, some people see it as fiction.",
        "However, Catholicism has been extremely influential in the world, and now, with more and more access around the world to entertainment and media, it becomes very difficult--the lines between what's truth and what's fiction become blurred.",
        "And I think they have a legitimate concern.",
        "People have a tendency to latch onto what Hollywood presents to them, because it's a more risqué perspective of things...",

        "All right, Pedro Noguera, here's the interesting point.",
        "I guess the biggest concern that the Catholic Church is raising with The Da Vinci Code is that because it says, the book and the movie will say that Jesus Christ married Mary Magdalene and fathered a child with her, but the Vatican hushed up the truth.",
        "And, of course, the Catholic Church contends that Jesus was celibate.",
        "Here's the interesting point, though.",
        "There will be those who will debate the idea with the Catholic Church whether any of this is fact.",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "And I think its kind of silly on the part of the Church to get overly defense about this, because I think, as Tara pointed out, they have a much bigger problem, with respect to the pedophile priests to worry about, than The Da Vinci Code.",
        "What I've seen from those who've read the book is that it actually prompts them to want to do more study, more research.",
        "Many people don't realize that the so-called Virgin Mary had children before Jesus was born, and I think these kinds of inconsistencies in the version of the Gospel that many have been given, I think, encourages more study, more research.",
        "And that's a good thing.",
        "The Church shouldn't be opposed to people wanting to learn more about the history of the church.",
        "Walter, as we see a growing a-religious community here in the United States, does this speak to, as Pedro suggested, an opportunity for those who really know little about religion, just in general, to do some study?",
        "You know, I think it could.",
        "And I think the trepidation that many people have about organized religion and religious denominations is over the very fact that they, themselves, have not been clear on these issues.",
        "I mean, when you look at some of the church teachings there are contradictions; when you look at the fact that, you know, I am a Christian, I grew up in a Methodist denomination; I always questioned, you know, the King James version of The Bible, because I just figured that that had to be a politically edited document, when you think of where it's coming from.",
        "So I think that, you know, there is a lot of confusion in religion.",
        "I think it's rather silly to make a fuss over this movie, because, if you're going to stand on faith, then you have to be strong enough to say, no matter what is put out there, that my truth is stronger at the end of the day and my faith will allow me to make sure that that truth is understood by the masses.",
        "So I think the church is actually doing a disservice to itself by entertaining this movie in this sense, in terms of creating, you know, a lot of hysteria over this one, particular, movie.",
        "And also, for a long time, we in the African-American community have always debated the idea, the image, and the visual depiction of Jesus.",
        "These kinds of things are debated over and over and over again.",
        "And this, I would think, Pedro, is just one in the same.",
        "That's right.",
        "And I think that those kinds of debates are very important.",
        "The role of the church during Nazism in Germany; its involvement in genocide in Latin America; these are questions that I think are of vital importance to the legitimacy of the church.",
        "And I would be far more concerned about that than Dan Brown's book."
