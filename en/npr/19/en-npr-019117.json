        "First, here's a quick reminder of last week's challenge from the puzzle editor of The New York Times and WEEKEND EDITION's puzzle master Will Shortz.",
        "Name a famous novel in two words.",
        "The first word has five letters, second word has 11.",
        "If you got the right one, the initial letters of the novel's title reversed are the initials of its author.",
        "What's the novel and who is the author?",
        "Well, almost 2,000 of you figured out the answer.",
        "And our randomly selected winner this week is Don Lemke of Sparta, Michigan.",
        "Congratulations, Don.",
        "Thank you, Rachel.",
        "OK.",
        "So, tell us what was the answer to last week's challenge?",
        "Well, the title of the novel was \"\"David Copperfield.\"\" Reverse the D and the C at the beginning of each word and you get C-D, which is for Charles Dickens, who wrote that.",
        "There you go.",
        "So, did this come pretty quickly or did you have to go through a lot of Dickens novels?",
        "Well, actually, it was kind of strange.",
        "My first guess was \"\"Great Expectations.\"\" I counted the letters and it was 12.",
        "I'm like, well, I'll set that one aside.",
        "And for some reason Charles Dickens just stuck in my head.",
        "So, I took the C-D and flipped-flopped that to D-C and then \"\"David Copperfield\"\" kind of jumped out at me.",
        "Good work.",
        "OK.",
        "So, you live in Sparta, Michigan.",
        "What do you do there, Don?",
        "Well, my home is at Sparta, but during the workweek, I'm an engineer at a little cereal company in Battle Creek, Michigan."
