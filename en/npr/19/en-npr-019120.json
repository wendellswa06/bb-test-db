        "They are moderate Democrats, for the large part, in swing districts.",
        "And these people took really hard political stances by voting for or against the energy and climate bill - because when you're in a swing district, you can't please everybody.",
        "And so, there are all kinds of other big, important legislation that they took hard votes on - the stimulus package - things that did pass - health care, financial regulations - and then all these other things that got stopped up in the Senate.",
        "And so they're back in their districts, focusing a lot more on really localized stuff than the national stories right now.",
        "National mood: not good for a moderate Democrat.",
        "The local stories: much better.",
        "So if I understand what you're saying, the average member of Congress may be talking more about what been done for the district rather than what Congress has done for the country?",
        "Exactly.",
        "I mean, for example, they might be talking about a new section of a highway that was built because of the stimulus act.",
        "They're not saying, I voted for the stimulus; they're saying, I brought you this new section of highway.",
        "Or they might say, for example, Frank Kratovil, a moderate Democrat out on Chesapeake Bay area in Maryland, will talk about the estuaries bill that he got through Congress.",
        "Not at all talking about health care or these other things that he actually voted against, but talking about the really localized things.",
        "It's much better for those people.",

        "An awful lot of what Democrats have to defend has to do with the programs that the president wanted, as Andrea was talking about.",
        "And there's a sense that at times, the White House has taken them for granted.",
        "Do you think that's the case?",
        "Well, I think Democrats feel as though they have walked the plank for the White House, and the White House is trying to help them out in return and pay them back - literally pay them back, by raising money for them.",
        "We have seen President Obama do a lot of high-profile public events, but what we haven't heard as much about is the private fundraisers that are often paired with those events.",
        "So for example, last week he was in New Jersey to do an economic event.",
        "Well, then he went to New York for a private fundraiser that was $30,000 a ticket.",

        "Well, I'll tell you another person they aren't looking to, and that is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.",
        "She is as big a symbol - if not a bigger symbol -than the president of some of these - so-called liberal agenda in Congress that these moderate Democrats are trying to distance themselves from.",
        "So then you'll get people like Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who is much closer to the blue dogs, the conservative Democrats.",

        "That's going to be a very short trip.",
        "And then the first family, as they did last summer, is going to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts.",
