        "Remember, Michel, more than a decade ago, APEC was the birthplace of the trade deal that ultimately became known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP.",
        "Former President Obama was a champion of that deal.",
        "His administration spent years trying to broker an agreement among a dozen countries in the hopes of providing - kind of rules of the road for commerce with some of the world's fastest-growing economies.",
        "Now one of President Trump's first acts, when he got into office, was to pull out of the TPP.",
        "He says the U.S.",
        "is not going to take part in that kind of multinational agreement anymore.",
        "He prefers to negotiate one-on-one with other countries.",
        "But the other 11 countries that signed onto the TPP, they're not giving up, and their trade ministers were meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit.",
        "This morning, they announced an agreement on core principles of a Pacific trade pact that does not include the United States.",
        "And how does China fit into this?",
        "Well, China was never part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but Chinese President Xi Jinping was here at APEC.",
        "He and Trump both gave speeches on Friday to a group of CEO's assembled for the summit.",
        "And it was a striking contrast, Michel.",
        "You had Trump complaining that multinational trade deals had been losers for the United States, insisting that he wasn't going to let America be taken advantage of anymore.",
        "And then you had President Xi offering a spirited defense of international trade pacts and arguing that globalization is irreversible.",
        "It was kind of a strange role reversal to have China, where the economy is far from open, making the case for free trade and an American president offering a more protectionist argument.",
        "As president though, Trump is sticking to his campaign platform of America first, and that's left a lot of leaders of other countries looking in a different direction.",

        "Scott, thanks so much.",

        "In a few moments we'll hear Treasury Secretary Jack Lew make a case for it.",
        "First a look at what trade agreements have meant for California.",
        "It has more factory workers than any other state in the nation, but there are far fewer of them than there used to be.",
        "Ben Bergman of KPCC reports as part of our project with member stations about America's role in the world, A Nation Engaged.",
        "Inside a sprawling warehouse just outside downtown L.A., a line of seamstresses sew high-end blouses.",
        "This city is still the garment capital of the U.S.",
        "even though only a fraction of the apparel workers who once worked here are left.",
        "Since 1990, the number of U.S.",
        "apparel manufacturing jobs has fallen by 80 percent."
