        "Monte Reel tells us the story in his new book, \"\"Between Men and Beasts: An Unlikely Explorer, the Evolution Debates, and the African Adventure That Took the Victorian World by Storm.\"\" Reel says that in du Chaillu's time, gorillas were almost considered mythical creatures.",
        "In 1847, a gorilla skull was found by a missionary in Gabon, on the west coast of Africa.",
        "But even after that, no one had really seen one in the wild, and it was considered to be just this - essentially a monster.",
        "Paul du Chaillu walks into the scene.",
        "He's this little-known explorer.",
        "He burst onto the scene.",
        "Who is this guy?",
        "He had gone to the west coast of Africa in 1848 to join his father who was a French trader.",
        "The American missionary named John Leighton Wilson had found this skull.",
        "And du Chaillu met Wilson, and he actually kind of moved in with him - Wilson adopted du Chaillu as his son, essentially.",
        "So du Chaillu was coming of age.",
        "He was only 17 at that point.",
        "A few years later, when he was in his 20s, he decided to go into Africa to try to be the first person to encounter gorillas in the wild and describe them.",
        "So he spent about three years on an expedition in the interior of Gabon.",
        "And when he emerged in 1859, he came out with more than 20 stuffed gorillas, gorillas that he had killed and that he stuffed, and he brought those to the United States and to London.",
        "So here is du Chaillu in London.",
        "He's being feted across town.",
        "He's being wined and dined because of his gorillas, and then London really turns on him.",
        "What happened?",
        "They turned on him for a couple of different reasons.",
        "But the first attacks were basically leveled against his scientific credibility.",
        "When he had gone into the forest to confront gorillas, he had had no scientific training at all.",
        "He was just a young kid, essentially on his own, doing this seat-of-the-pants expedition.",
        "So he came to London, presented his findings.",
        "He had no real idea how to make maps, for example, so his maps were flawed.",
        "And people attacked those as being inaccurate.",
        "But then the attack against him really got personal.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Let's talk about that for a moment.",
        "So du Chaillu was half African, and you've been able to determine that he was born on what is now the island of Reunion.",
        "His mother was from Africa.",
        "You write that his father was a white African trader.",
        "Why did he feel like he had to hide that for most of his life?",
        "When people would ask him about his parents, he would say that his father was a French trader, which was true, but he never really spoke of his mother.",
        "Among the circles that he was traveling in - in London, particularly, the Royal Geographical Society, for example - there were no minorities at that time allowed there.",
        "But there were rumors that were always kind of circulating about this.",
        "And actually, those rumors kind of came to the fore just as his fame was reaching its highest level in 1861."
