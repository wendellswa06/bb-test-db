        "He must have been devastated by this because here he is having done something that no explorer had ever done before, and now, he's being undermined in this horrible way.",
        "In London, there was a trader from Africa that he had been acquainted with in Gabon who started to write to papers in London, sort of like letters to the editor, insinuating that du Chaillu wasn't who he said he was, that he was hiding his parentage.",
        "And when du Chaillu started to see these and feel these attacks, he actually challenged his critics to go with him back to Africa, back into the forest, and he said he would prove everything that he saw.",

        "You know, as you can imagine, somebody spreading this just horrific disease is not welcome.",
        "And eventually, he's forced to flee - literally under the hail of arrows.",
        "But the one thing that he's able to carry out are his notes, and he just kind of noted down everything he saw very meticulously, and those notes saved him.",
        "So he was, to a certain extent, at that point, embraced by a lot of the critics that had disparaged him before.",
        "Where was he traveling at that time?",
        "This is in Gabon, right, sort of, near the equator, inland towards a region called the Crystal Mountains.",
        "And during that second expedition, in describing it, he wrote that his aim wasn't to slaughter gorillas this time.",
        "Enough specimens had already been collected, and he just kind of wanted to, he said, lay the scientific record straight.",
        "And he did.",
        "In the end - at the end of the day, it's his information that led to 100 years of more information about the gorillas.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He wasn't appreciated at all in his time.",
        "And his name, after that, became a little bit of a slur in some quarters because he was seen as this, you know, kind of imperial explorer who went in and shot all of these gorillas and didn't really understand them.",
        "But that reputation has undergone quite a re-evaluation in recent years."
