        "Yeah, you know, I disagree with the conventional wisdom that she simply danced around.",
        "First, I should say I liked her going in, I met her years ago on her earlier tours of duty here.",
        "And I liked her even better after these hearings, partly for her sense of humor.",
        "But I think she was very specific on two important things.",
        "First, she sees courts as having an obligation to defer to elected officials except in the most extreme cases.",
        "That's a very clear view and it runs crosswise to some of what the courts are doing.",
        "And you could say it runs crosswise to what some, although I don't think most liberals think now.",

        "Calling balls and strikes.",
        "Yes, calling balls and stripes.",
        "She said it was robotic to view judging that way.",

        "In this sense, the Constitution involves multiple values.",
        "In this sense, she sounded a lot like former Justice Souter in his commencement address at Harvard.",
        "And I think that gave you a pretty clear sense of what she's going to be like.",
        "David Brooks, did you get that sense, too, where all these questions that come up in these hearings about whether we're headed for an activist judge did you hear an activist judge coming through in Kagan one way or the another?",

        "I didn't see anything.",

        "I did agree with her rebuttal of the umpire metaphor.",
        "One of the lines that's been spread about this court is it's this five-to-four monolith, pro-business, very conservative.",
        "There's a great post that I recommend on the blog, SCOTUSblog, which is an outstanding blog by Tom Goldstein who tears that apart, who shows that only 20 percent of the decisions this court has reached are five to four.",
        "It's rarely the five conservatives against the four liberals Scalia and Alito are often against each other.",
        "So judging really is about discretion.",
        "It does not fall on the ideological lines.",
        "I don't think we have a sense that we know where she's going to be, but she certainly gave the impression of someone who's smart, intelligent and fair-minded.",
        "I'd like to take just a minute to talk about immigration.",
        "The president was talking about this yesterday, saying the system is broken.",

        "David, where do you think the immigration debate goes from here?",
        "Anywhere at all before November?",

        "I'm not sure Democrats want it as an actual issue.",
        "They've pushed it rhetorically, not substantively.",
        "The fact is, the country has become much more skeptical of any grand immigration plan until we do something about the border.",
        "That's just the way the country has shifted Democrat and Republican."
