        "Yeah, it's a little more challenging because we don't know yet what's going to happen.",

        "And there are many similarities and differences, so there's a basis for comparing what's happening right now with the past.",
        "Well, if there are any easily described lessons so far from what we've seen and from what you've been teaching, what are they?",
        "What's something that you can teach aspiring MBAs about the world of finance based on what's happening every day in the markets right now?",

        "Well, thanks to all of you for talking with us.",

        "But if the entire country is going bankrupt, then their investment is going to be wiped out.",

        "How do you teach that?",
        "Well, something about academia is that, really, it emphasizes critical thinking and lateral thinking, and that's very important.",
        "Of course, most of them are going to be in financial institutions with certain constraints, there are going to be consequences.",
        "So, it's important to foster that critical thinking approach.",
        "But do you think that the capacity for being contrarian, do you think that's something that's teachable, or is it a point of character that some people acquire and others just will rarely do so?",
        "At some degree, you can teach it.",

        "And over the summer, I worked for two months on a trading floor.",
        "And it really sort of confirmed that even though the credit market had begun to unfold completely and the subprime story was already getting old, but now with everything going on, it sort of made me realize that it's going to be radically different than what I expected, or even what I experienced over the summer.",
        "Marcia, what do you think?",
        "Yeah, I think that for sure, this is a completely different world that we're going into once we graduate from Stern.",
        "Things are really changing very quickly, and I think people are reassessing a lot of ideas that they had, you know, taken for granted in the past.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Yeah, I think it's - I'm not sure if this is true for everyone - but it seems to be the case that in good times, people don't really have a sense of what's that risky or what's really going on, and they tend to stretch themselves way too far.",
        "Do you have any friends or classmates who, indeed, have taken a more drastic lesson from all this and said, time to apply to law school or, you know, let's get out of here in a hurry?",
