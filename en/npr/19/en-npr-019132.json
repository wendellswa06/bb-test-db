        "When it came to the hungry - or, more precisely, those the Bush Administration has categorized as food insecure - there was silence.",
        "So too on issues like poverty and youth violence and the epidemic of the uninsured.",
        "And Jesus made only the briefest appearance - first from Wolf Blitzer's lips in a question to Rudy Giuliani and then from Mormon Governor Mitt Romney who declared his love for Jesus.",
        "Governor Romney doesn't really want an in-depth examination of his Mormon faith.",
        "Mayor Giuliani certainly doesn't want to explain his penchant for marrying in a religious context.",
        "And John McCain, who once called religious right leaders agents of intolerance, isn't leaping at the chance to play pastor either.",
        "How differently the Democrats are behaving.",
        "Monday night the progressive religious organization Sojourners hosted the three leading Democratic presidential candidates at a forum on faith, values, and poverty.",
        "It was a Jesus fair.",
        "John Edwards talked about how his faith in Jesus saved his life after the death of his son.",
        "Barack Obama, playing theologian, talked about what Jesus required of men and women today.",
        "And Hillary Clinton adopted the use of Republican religious code words when talking about her faith.",
        "She spoke of witness and prayer warriors even as she suggested that her faith in Jesus is what gave her the strength to save her marriage despite the ease with which she might have divorced Bill Clinton after his adultery.",
        "So what are we to make of this odd political situation?",
        "Well, the Democrats have clearly decided that George W.",
        "Bush's example of talking openly about the substance of his religious faith is the way to go.",
        "In 2000 and again in 2004, Bush ran as virtually a pastor-in-chief when talking to Christian audiences.",
        "He made it seem that the religious should vote for him simply because of his faith.",
        "The Democrats, longing for religious votes are gambling they can do the same.",
        "Republicans meanwhile, terrified of being too closely identified with Bush are doing all they can to run away from him.",
        "One of the ways they are trying to do that is by any muting any religion talk.",
        "They are trying to return to hard-core conservatism devoid of any of Bush's faith or compassion talk.",
        "What an odd political legacy President Bush is beginning to leave - Democrats as evangelists and Republicans running scared from faith.",
        "David Kuo is the former deputy director of the office of the faith-based community initiatives in the Bush administration.",
        "From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.",
        "I'm Debbie Elliott.",
        "Nearly all the Democratic presidential candidates were in San Diego this weekend making their pitches for support to the California State Party Convention.",
        "Senator Hillary Clinton spoke first, but she may as well have been speaking for the entire group.",
        "I want you to know that the very first thing I will do upon taking office is to end the war in Iraq and bring our troops home."

        "Ina, should we assume that the Iraq war was issue number 1 on the Democratic candidates' agenda?",
        "Absolutely, Debbie.",
        "The stronger the statement about ending the war, the more scathing the comment about the way President Bush has handled the war, the bigger the cheers from the crowd.",
        "All the candidates also talked about global warming.",
        "They all talked about having a national health care policy and about restoring America's declining reputation abroad, but Iraq was really the issue that everybody cared most about.",
        "I should say there's one candidate that did have one issue pretty much all to himself - that's Barack Obama.",
        "He talked about ending the destructive partisanship that leads to cynicism, he says, about American politics.",
        "And here's what he had to say:",
        "People tell me I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington.",
        "But I promise you this: I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change.",
        "(Soundbite of crowd cheering)",
        "And I should say that after this speech, there were supporters - new supporters of him, as well as old ones - lined up down the hall upstairs in the convention center waiting to get into a room so they could become volunteers for his campaign.",
        "Did anything happen at this convention that changed the status quo in the presidential race?",
        "You know, not really, Debbie.",
        "The media has been criticized for talking about the top three candidates in each party.",
        "With the Democrats - you know, that being Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards - but the delegates maybe felt the same way, too.",
        "Those three candidates had the most bodies in the seats, the most cheering, the most passionate responses."

        "And how did the delegates respond to the so-called second-tier candidates?",
        "Well, you know, in every hard-core Democratic crowd there's going to be a cadre of Dennis Kucinich loyalists.",
        "He is the congressman from Ohio, and they like his idealism and his proposals for, for example, starting a Department of Peace.",
        "And then there's Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico, and the media talks about him as the resume candidate because he's also been energy secretary, an ambassador to the U.N., and has negotiated with leaders around the world.",
        "But he was talking about himself as the resume candidate, too, and making a strong pitch to the delegates to support him because of his experience saying: don't go with the rock star, a veiled reference to Obama; don't vote for somebody who's got all the money, a veiled reference to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama; and don't vote for someone just because they are a legacy candidate, again, a veiled reference to Senator Clinton.",
        "I should have to say that the delegates that I spoke to, some of them have made up their minds; most of them haven't.",
        "They are very excited about their prospects for 2008, for regaining the White House, and they pretty much liked the entire field, and they're going to wait to make up their minds.",
        "They like having options.",
        "You bet.",
        "There were some words of support for the new White House strategy, but as was the case yesterday, there was plenty of skepticism.",
        "Senators on the Armed Services Committee pressed Secretary Gates for more details and for assurances.",
        "Coming up, a chat with our regular political observers, David Brooks and E.J.",
        "Dionne.",
        "First, here is NPR's David Welna from the Capitol.",
        "Unlike the bitterness and sense of betrayal that many senators on the Foreign Relations Committee expressed yesterday to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, passions were much cooler today on the Armed Services panel.",
        "Robert Gates, after all, has only been defense secretary for three weeks and as such has a virtually clean slate when it comes to the Iraq war.",
        "Still, the committee's new Democratic chairman, Carl Levin, made it very clear to Gates how sharply he disagrees with the president's decision to add more troops to Iraq."

        "It would be a sublime yet historic irony if those who believe the views of the military professionals were neglected at the onset of the war were now to dismiss the views of the military as irrelevant or wrong.",
        "Gates characterized Iraq's leaders as learning as they go and committed to ending sectarian violence, saying they risk seeing their country fall apart.",
        "But when asked what the Iraqis would do if the Iraqi's failed to make good on their commitments, Gates said he didn't know what those consequences would be.",
        "If we talk about the consequences of American failure and defeat in Iraq, then saying if you don't do this, we'll leave and we'll leave now does not strike me as being in the national interest of the United States.",

        "defeat in Iraq seemed to hang over the hearing, and South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham scolded his colleagues for even contemplating such a possibility.",
