        "South Korea could reassess its non-nuclear status.",
        "So I think the conjunction of factors that we can bring China into play would have the goal of obtaining a nuclear - a freeze to lock in North Korea at its current level of capabilities.",
        "And for China - I think the conjunction of factors is that for China, they would retain their buffer in North Korea.",
        "And they would prevent these adverse strategic consequences.",
        "North Korea would maintain its minimum deterrent, and the regime would remain in power.",
        "For the United States, it would prevent this breakout, and it would offer us a not-great narrative.",
        "But we would say that this is an interim agreement toward the long-term goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.",
        "Well Mr. Litwak, in the minute we have left, can you really trust any - the process of reaching or signing any agreement with a regime like North Korea's?",
        "That's another fair question.",
        "They've cheated in the past.",
        "I believe that a relevant precedent for what we should be engaged in with North Korea is the Iran nuclear deal that constrains capabilities and buys time and has a rigorous verification and inspection protocol to ensure that North Korea, if such a freeze agreement could be achieved, would not cheat on it.",
        "Robert Litwak is director of international security studies at the Woodrow Wilson Center.",
