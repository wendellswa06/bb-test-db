        "And he was fun to watch, and he was fun to listen to, and he was clearly an interesting person.",
        "But the music that he made in many ways, with its rhythms, was as complex in that way as the sort of thing that you look for in an Ellington.",
        "And I also like the fact that he did have a social conscience and that the music was embraced despite the fact that it had, you know, a message that was realistic, it was positive.",
        "And in terms of the term African-American which, to be perfectly honest, I don't like and try very hard not to use, although I slip sometimes.",
        "I think black American is better.",
        "Imagine saying something like, you know, I'm African-American and I am proud.",
        "Think about it?",
        "Say it loud, I'm African-American and I'm proud, you noticed how that doesn't work.",
        "That's why black is better.",
        "And he made it comfortable for us to say black.",
        "That's true.",
        "Remember, we were struggling with not only - we were the Afro in public schools or we were struggling with the word black, whether that still was a word that was negative.",
        "That's true.",
        "So he kind of made that a popular thing for us.",
        "Let me ask the three of you one more thing about James Brown before we move on.",
        "Do you think that the public is going to remember him primarily for his music, for his dancing, for his, you know, his hair and his shows as opposed to some of the other things that he was involved in politically?",
        "And, you know, he supported Richard Nixon at one point.",
        "He had some troubles with the law.",
        "There was a period of time between the, I guess, ‘70s and ‘80s when he was a little passé but it kind of came back.",
        "How do you think he's ultimately going to be looked at?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I think, James is going to be remembered for all of that, and be remembered to be a complex individual with many layers.",
        "And I think that's the best legacy anybody could want, is to be remembered from a lot of different perspectives for a lot of different things.",
        "I think he will be remembered for the pride that's in \"Say It Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud."

        "She had to memorize that.",
        "So I think that these things will all contribute to the legacy of someone that has influenced everything from R&B and gospel to even hip-hop.",
        "He's also set in stone I think for the mainstream by one thing, and it's \"The Blues Brothers.",
        "That is a classic.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "And everybody has seen that appearance.",
        "I think that was part of his revival.",
        "And it was early, it was a fantastic appearance and that alone will definitely help.",
        "But it's interesting about the Nixon part because I think that that's going to be largely a footnote.",
        "When Sammy Davis Jr. supported Nixon, first of all, there was an emblematic photograph; and Sammy Davis Jr. had some serious racial identity problems and so everybody jumped on him.",
        "But nobody has ever questioned whether James Brown liked what color he was.",
        "So I think he got past the Nixon thing in a way that many entertainers couldn't have.",
        "E.R., you get the last word on James Brown.",
        "OK.",
        "One of his legacies we're already seeing, Reverend Al Sharpton said that he promised James Brown he will wear a hairdo in his honor, and that's what he has been doing for about 30 years.",
        "Wow.",
        "And he say he's going to continue to wear that hairdo, even though it looks like he's got less hair now to do a pompadour with."

        "Well, I'm a ‘tweener on this because, personally, this - the time that I'm flying might be the one time that my cell phone is not on and it ends up being a time of relaxation.",
        "However, if I did have the opportunity to use it, would I?",
        "Especially when we're talking about expanding it further digitally into the Internet uses.",

        "And the world is continuing to go grow smaller and more wired everyday.",
        "It's only a matter of time before we have wires not only on the ground but also in the atmosphere that are accessible to the general public.",
        "So cell phone usage and Internet access are eventually just going to become another appurtenance of basic air travel.",
        "And with broadband technology now emerging and even exploding on the scene, you can have access everywhere from the car to the café.",
        "So it only makes sense that it's going to eventually gets the airplanes, once they answer to the security question.",

        "So this now is one of those kind of scary areas.",
        "The FAA is going to issue a report, I believe, at the end of this month looking at whether those safety issues are real or not.",

        "But reading is a highly artificial and strenuous activity that most human beings in the world do not particularly like.",
        "And when you can actually talk on the phone instead of reading in those little tubes, we are going to be sitting there in our seats where every third person at any time is going to be having a conversation about the fact that they're in the plane.",
