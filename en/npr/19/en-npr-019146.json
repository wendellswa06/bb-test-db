        "They were followed for 4.6 years on average and the outcome that was measured was the risk of death or having a heart attack.",
        "In fact, at the end of those period of time, at 4.6 years, there were about the same number of patients in both groups that had died or had a heart attack.",
        "Perhaps even more surprising, at one year, three years and five years nearly as many patients receiving medicines alone were free of chest pain compared to those that had actually received a stent.",

        "At the end of one year, 66 percent of the patients that received a stent were completely free of chest pain, but 58 percent of the patients that received medical therapy were also free of chest pain.",
        "And so we gained about eight percentage points of freedom from chest pain overall with the placement of a stent, which is a fairly complicated procedure.",
        "I think the take-home message from this is that it's okay to start with medical therapy, with drugs and lifestyle changes.",
        "And more than half of those patients by the end of a year are going to be completely free of chest pain and they will never need, at least not in a short term, to have a stent placed.",
        "And on the other hand, if people have a lot more difficulty, if the pain interferes with their lifestyle, then they can have a stent placed at any time.",

        "It means compliance was very likely very similar in the two groups.",
        "And so then the question was, given the current circumstances with how patients comply with medical therapy, was there an added benefit of placing a stent, and there was an added benefit.",
        "There was somewhat less chest pain, but it was a modest benefit, and a lot of people that just got the medicines and lifestyle changes, regardless of their compliance, were free of pain at the end of one year, three years and five years."
