        "Thanks very much - Saul, I'm sorry?",
        "It's impressive, but I still put out the caveat that unless we have a motivated group of patients, we're going to have long-term problems in getting the type of statistical significance that we're talking about in the study.",
        "Saul, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it.",

        "Yes, hello.",
        "Hi.",
        "My husband, a few years ago, was having actually discomfort, not acute pain, discomfort when we were walking, and more in his back, upper back and neck, you know?",
        "And anyway, finally the doctor said go ahead, have a stress test, and we have a very strong and well reputation here of a heart center area here in Traverse City, Michigan.",
        "Anyway, that showed there is - they decided that he needed an angiogram to check out, and he did have blockage with what do you call it, the lower left ventricle?",
        "It's been a while since I read the reports.",
        "But the thing that was most distressing on this was that when the doctor talked to him after this - before he had this, before he went ahead with this, was the way the doctor came on, frankly, was like a used-car salesman, and because my husband likes to play tennis and be active, the doctor just kind of went blurry on any medication or any other procedure which I tried to raise, because he said I can't promise you, you know, like with tennis, that kind of thing, active, with medicine, you know, you have a better chance with the stent, etc."

        "So he was selling the angioplasty and a stent?",
        "Yes, and not only that, then he had the same kind of problem Vice President Cheney did, had to go back in.",
        "I ended up, because I'd learned a long time ago with my own problems, to do a lot of medical research myself, particularly after living in Ann Arbor.",
        "He had an acute rheumatoid arthritis attack, which I tracked down to the I.V.",
        "heparin as a possibility, which is a rare occurrence.",
        "But anyway, here's the thing.",
        "I've always gotten copies of reports for years.",
        "Well, let me go back to the question about…",
        "Wait, wait, there's one important thing here to say to you.",
        "There was no evidence in any of other stress test until after the procedure of any actual, what do you call it - myocardial - anyway, a heart attack, until afterwards.",
        "And we knew that was kind of a risk.",
        "He will not go back for a stress test.",
        "I started him out with - he was diabetic at the time, he still is, with going back on slow exercise and everything.",
        "He's 80, let's see -",
        "I'm sorry, Lois, we can't get the entire medical history, nor can Dr. Nissen diagnose on the radio.",
        "But getting back to the point, I think there is a concern among some people that doctors were too quick to adopt the angioplasty and stent procedure before waiting for studies like this one.",
        "Well, your listener of course makes a very good point, and that's why this study is so important, is it tells us that patients have choices.",
        "This is really about patient choices, and I think we can now say to patients like this gentleman, look, if you want to give a trial of medical treatment with drugs and lifestyle changes, there's a better than 50/50 chance you're going to become pain-free, and you can avoid having a stent procedure with some potential complications down the road.",
        "If, however, your lifestyle, playing tennis and other things, if you just can't get there with medicines, we can always go back and put the stent in, and we haven't put you in harm's way by delaying and giving medicine a chance to work.",
        "So it's a very important choice now that we can offer patients.",
        "Here's an e-mail we got from Dermot in Boston.",
        "As a health professional, it's upsetting to me that angioplasty, stenting, PTCA, PCI, etc., is referred to as cardiac surgery in this and other programs.",
        "It's certainly not surgery."

        "These procedures are performed by cardiologists, not cardiac surgeons, with is an entirely different specialty, requiring a different training and different board certification.",
        "Cardiac surgery would be coronary, artery, bypass, grafting, valve replacement, etc., all of which most often require opening the patient's chest.",
        "I and many other health-care professionals listening would much enjoy this disambiguation announced on the air.",
        "I guess those of us who are mere civilians think you take a knife and you cut me open, that's surgery.",
        "Okay, let me tell you that your listener is absolutely right.",
        "In fact, at the top of the hour you described me as a cardiac surgeon, which I'm not.",
        "I apologize for that.",
        "And I am a cardiologist, and what the listener is pointing out is that there are two branches of heart-disease treatment: cardiac surgeons, who perform operations where they open the chest and they sew in bypass grafts and so on; and then cardiologists like myself, where we do medical treatment, and some cardiologists, called interventional cardiologists, perform angioplasties and stents, which do not involve opening the chest.",
        "They're actually done through a little catheter, a little tube, put in from the groin.",

        "Very well, thank you.",
        "I'm just a little unhappy that this study had to be done at this stage.",
        "This study should have been done before the cardiologists authorized angioplasty so much.",
        "We should have had this information before offering this treatment to all the patients.",
        "The other problem I have is - well, there are two other things.",
        "One, that the study had to be done in V.A.",
        "hospitals and in Canada, probably because the cardiologists were unwilling to accrue patients.",
        "And the third problem is that I see very little improvement in the medical therapy since the (unintelligible) study came out 30 years ago, you know, where we were seeing 70, 80 percent survival in patients treated medically.",
        "So to me that seems a serious indictment of cardiology."

        "Stents were introduced in 1994.",

        "They got it up and running pretty soon after stents became commonplace, and they've gotten us an answer that is very, very helpful.",
        "I did want to mention one other thing that was brought up, and that is what about medical therapy?",
        "Why did we see the result that we saw?",
        "And it is interesting that medical therapy - I don't agree with your listener - has improved dramatically.",
        "Our drugs to lower cholesterol are much more effective.",
        "Our drugs to lower blood pressure, our blood thinners are better.",
        "And so I think the reason we're seeing this result is we've got good treatments for patients.",
        "Stents are good treatment, medicine's good treatment, and if we use each wisely, reserving the stents for those that need them, and giving very good medical therapy to others, then we're going to get the best outcome for the most number of people.",

        "Well, that's a great question.",
        "Being a study that was done largely in the VA hospital system, this study is dominated by men, and it is a huge problem.",

        "We know that coronary heart disease in women is different.",
        "Fortunately, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute has been working very hard on a variety of initiatives to get more studies done in women, and I wish we had more women in this study as well.",
        "One thing that hasn't come up yet that I thought perhaps we ought to at least talk about a little bit is what about bypass surgery?",
        "You know, there are three options, not two: medicines, stenting and bypass surgery."

        "And it's important to understand that bypass surgery has been shown in certain patient populations to reduce the risk of heart attack and death.",
        "And so I think you may see a little bit of a tilt now back to doing more bypass operations.",
        "So as we learn more, we find out sometimes that our older therapies have some significant advantages, and I think things are going to come a little bit more back into balance now that we have a study like Courage.",
        "And finally, we just have a few seconds left, but I hope you can answer Tom in Ann Arbor's e-mail question.",
        "Wouldn't delaying a stent procedure carry a potential risk that it would be needed later when a patient is older and surgery more dangerous?",
        "And again, I guess we've just been told it's not surgery.",
        "It isn't surgery, and in fact there is a little bit of increase in risk of a stent as you get older, but that risk doesn't go up very steeply.",
        "And so one of the principles of medicine, in Latin, is primum non nocere, which means above all do no harm.",
        "And so any time you can avoid a procedure that might have some risks, it's good medical practice to avoid it.",

        "That's one of Einstein's great foundations of physics.",
        "But that statement comes with a lot of qualifiers, and while you can't go faster than light, it is possible to slow light down.",
        "And under the right conditions, you can slow it down a whole lot and even stop it, and then send it on its way again.",
        "Well, sound strange?",
        "Here's something that might sound even stranger.",
        "This week in the journal \"\"Nature,\"\" researchers described an experiment in which they stopped light and trapped it in a cloud of chilled atoms.",
        "And then some of those atoms were moved a short distance away to a second cloud and the researchers were able to then recall the original beam of light from the second cloud.",
        "In other words, essentially they transferred light to matter and then back to light again."
