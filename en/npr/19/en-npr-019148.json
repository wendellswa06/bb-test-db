        "I know you're scratching your head.",
        "We'll talk about it a little bit more.",
        "Joining me now is Lene Hau at the - she is the Mallinckrodt professor of physics and applied physics at Harvard, and she's one of the authors of \"\"The Professor.\"\" Lene Hau joins us from a studio at Harvard campus.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Is it possible for a lay person to understand what you did?",
        "Well, I think so.",
        "The short version of the story is that we can basically stop a light part in one part of space, extinguish it there, and then later revive it in a completely different location.",
        "And you described the process actually very well.",
        "We do that by creating two extremely cold clouds of atoms, actually called Bose-Einstein condensate, superfluids - it's a superfluid state of matter.",
        "So each of the two clouds separated in space turned into a superfluid where the atoms behave in lock step.",
        "Then we can send the light parts into the first condensate, the first atom cloud, stop it there, and then create an imprint of the light parts that will then fly out in space and travel across as a perfect matter copy of the light pulse to the second condensate, to the second cold cloud; and then we can revive it in that second cloud and send the light pulse back on its way as if nothing had happened.",
        "Could you theoretically pick it up and put it in a box and carry it some place else and then let the light out?",
        "Sure.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Wow!",
        "It sounds almost like science fiction.",
        "Yes.",

        "Well, tell us about the fun.",
        "Do you actually think about doing that?",
        "How far have you actually moved the light stored as matter?",
        "It's - we have moved it.",
        "We create these two cold atom clouds.",
        "They are separated by 0.2 millimeters.",
        "And so the atom clouds are completely separated, absolutely no overlap, and then this matter copy moves 0.2 millimeters in space, which is a long distance for atoms and a long distance for light.",
        "And we could -the important point is then that once that imprints, that matter copies out in free space like you're indicating, you can then grab on to it with a laser beam and in some sense put it on the shelf, store it there for a while, and then grab it again and send it back on its way into the second cloud.",
        "And the curious thing is that we, you know, this will be a good way of storing information for long periods of time.",
        "But we can actually also manipulate - and that's very important - we can actually start massaging, pinching these matter copy with laser beams, for example, and then change the shape of that matter copy and send it on its way; and then we can revive the light pulse with a changed shape, so we can actually manipulate light in this way very powerfully.",
        "When you say - let me just give out the number 1-800-989-8255 talking about moving light changing into matter.",
        "When you say manipulate it in shape, what exactly do you mean?",
        "It could take a completely - the light pulse - actually, I should sort of back off a little bit because when we start out with the light pulse and free space, it actually starts out being about a mile long.",
        "And then we send it into the first cold atom cloud and the light parts slows down to 15 miles an hour and compresses to only 1,000th of an inch.",
        "So it's less than half the thickness of a hair.",
        "And then when we form them, then we extinguished that light pulse and the matter copy of the light pulse starts to fly out.",
        "And that matter copy has exactly the same shape as the original light pulse.",
        "And it's precisely that shape, that imprint, that we can start to change, and we can also change what is called the face information in the matter copy and thereby in the light pulse.",
        "So that means that we start to have some very, very powerful ways of manipulating light, which, for example, could be very, very interesting in connection with optical communication.",
        "Does this have anything to do with the equivalence of matter and energy?",
        "Yeah, and certainly you can say in these experiments we kind of take it from - we take information from one form and make a perfect copy in another form, in this case from light to matter and back to light.",
        "And we preserve all the energy in doing that, and that's really the magical thing, that we don't lose information in this process."

        "Have you got any?",
        "Well, I mean I think we have here - partly why I'm so excited about it is that we have some new territory here and it's really opening up a lot of doors.",
        "There's so many things where we could go - or so many things we could do from here.",
        "And in terms of applications, now we - of course this is guesswork on my part, predicting about the future because of course, what we have here is a prototype system where we have some new territory.",
        "But I think there is a possibility, really, for making, you know, using this in some interesting ways, some interesting applications in the future.",
        "And coming back to optical communication, we love to send light down optical fibers, code information in light, and to get very high data transfer rates.",
        "For example if you want - you're sitting at your computer and you want to download movies, the best way of sending information over long distances is through optical fibers.",
        "But then the problem is light is great for transport, but how do you change it?",
        "How will you process?",
        "And that's where this comes in, because we can then take it into matter form in, say, in a node, at a node position in an optical network, we could convert the light information perfectly into matter, manipulate it, process it, and then send it back on its way down another optical fiber.",
        "memory and a CPU processor.",
        "And what we have done with this research, I would say, is we have moved toward not just being able to store light in a memory, but we're actually moving towards being able to make a processor.",

        "And the curious thing is also that we can kind of - we got this as manipulating light with matter, but just as well we manipulate matter with light.",
