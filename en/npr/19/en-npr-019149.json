        "But if we want to transfer the information, we just don't do a measurement on the system.",
        "And in terms of getting back to the entanglement, the curious thing is that we could actually send a classical light pulse in without entanglement into the first condensate, let it travel out in free space, and then get back and massage it, manipulate it, so that it actually turns into an entangled atomic state.",
        "And then we could read that into the second cloud and get a nice entangled light state out of the system.",

        "Because it's actually - when we start out with a condensate, all the atoms in the first condensate are in a particular internal state because we have to deal here both with the atom's internal structure and also the motion of the atoms as a whole.",
        "And when we create the matter imprint, we are actually promoting part of the atom into an excited internal state.",
        "And when the matter copy travels across, it's actually in that excited internal state.",

        "So in that sense, they become identical to the atoms that are in the second condensate and also identical to the atoms that were in the first condensate."
