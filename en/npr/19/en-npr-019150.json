        "Thanks.",
        "Tell us, Jed, just how different is the racial composition of New Orleans today?",
        "Well, as we learned in the election, New Orleans remains a happily majority black city.",
        "I believe the proportions, which were about two-thirds black to one-third white, have shifted slightly downward in terms of the black majority, but it remains firmly in place.",
        "And, of course, Mayor Nagin won re-election in that mayoral race.",
        "Well, let's talk a little bit about the role of race in that election since you brought it up first.",
        "How did race play a role there?",
        "Well, race was a very interesting and pivotal part of that election.",
        "Four years ago, when Mayor Nagin emerged from corporate world to run for office as kind of a conservative black candidate, he commanded enormous support from the white community.",
        "Some of that, indeed a lot of that, eroded this go-round.",
        "However, the most conservative parts of the white community remained in his pocket out of I think distaste as much as anything for the Landrieu family, which ran Mitch Landrieu the lieutenant governor for mayor.",
        "Mitch's father, Moon Landrieu, was the last white mayor of New Orleans.",
        "Mitch, the election may have been his to lose, at one point it certainly looked that way.",
        "But in the fullness of time, what Mitch did was to sort of propose himself as a harmless, white version of Ray Nagin.",
        "And people figured, well, the Ray Nagin we have is the one we know, and we might as well stay with him.",
        "And the black support that Nagin needed was there for him.",
        "Race was such a glaring wound in New Orleans right after Katrina.",
        "What is the state of race relations now?",
        "What has happened since then?",
        "My view - and it's not everybody's view - is that on the ground at the grassroots level after this trauma, race relations within the communities have actually improved.",
        "I've spoken of this with people I've been working with on the ground in the Lower Ninth Ward, and they tend to agree with me, at least some of them.",
        "Maybe they're telling me what I want to hear."

        "But I think we have seen a sense of commonality, a sense of shared burden here, that has helped us get past some of the barriers that for so long, indeed far longer here than in other parts of the south, have kept us apart.",
        "At the national level, indeed at the political level, where much shouting and carrying on occurs, I think we're seeing still a lot of racial noise, some of it racist, bluntly, other aspects of it racialist, if there is a difference.",
        "Certainly Mayor Nagin has not been above invoking race as - where he sees an opportunity.",
        "We're all familiar with the famous chocolate city speech and that sort of thing.",
        "I think at the end of the day that speech didn't hurt him nearly as much as people might have thought it would.",
        "I think it had a consolidating effect on his black support.",
        "And while it dismayed the sort of tourism industry, at the end of the day, I think Nagin was really saying that New Orleans was and will remain black and that that wasn't a bad thing.",
        "And I think many of us agree with him.",
        "But, you know, you also hear about white residents of New Orleans who say they hope that some of the blacks who left don't come back.",
        "That's a reality, isn't it?",
        "That is a reality.",
        "And there are those who say it, you know, with a glint in their eye and a clearly racist subtext to their remarks.",
        "There are others who are saying what the city cannot support, indeed could not support long prior to Katrina, is the level of impoverishment that we have tried to carry forward here as our burden.",
        "The fact is the corporate sector bailed out on New Orleans years ago, and that is the tragedy that has resulted in - that is the failure, the default, that had resulted in a hugely impoverished city.",
        "We have, you know, shockingly high rates of childhood poverty; I think it's 40 percent.",
        "Illiteracy - all the hallmarks of a city more people than it has the economy to carry.",
        "And if we could bring back New Orleans as a city with economic opportunity for all of its residents, I think we would have a better city.",
        "And I'm quite tolerant of remarks to that effect.",
        "I've heard them Nagin.",
        "I've heard them from leader in the black community.",
        "And I've heard them from whites of various different strata.",
        "There a lot of different competing visions for the future of New Orleans.",
        "What do you think is likely to happen?",
        "And that is to say that we will never be able to solve the problems of poverty unless we engage in less demonizing and stigmatizing of the poor and focusing on the structural features as well as the personal habits, dispositions and behaviors that may perpetuate self-destructive behavior.",
        "Well, right now we sort of find ourselves on the bubble, and I think things could go either a couple of different ways.",
        "I think the great concern -the most realistic concern, because it is the most present risk, is that New Orleans, for lack of much guidance, we've kind of defaulted and deferred to the market, Ray Nagin's favorite governor around here, and simply haven't gotten much of a planning process together as yet.",
        "There is one now in the works belatedly, but in its absence people have been rebuilding their homes in areas of the city that may not come back.",
        "And my great concern is that we wind up with clusters of recovery in a sea of shanties or abandoned buildings.",
        "And that's a very difficult - different land -difficult landscape for a city to sustain as regards infrastructure, water, sewerage, schools, police and all that stuff.",
        "There's another scenario, troubling, but I think less likely to occur, which is that New Orleans comes back as kind of a museum to its former glory, a museum to its culture, a Disneyland in which the parts of the city, the old parts of the city that didn't flood - the French Quarter and uptown and what-not -remain as they are now, fully habitable and attractive to tourism and the middle class, white and black, but that the working poor, most of whom in this town are black, get forced out for lack of affordable housing as much as anything else."

        "The only part of it that I would consider really, you know, sort of racially shaped was some of that chocolate city stuff.",
        "The recent chatter about New York City and the 9/11 site being a hole in the ground was clumsy and stupid and unwelcome in a dialog nationally about how the nation can rally to New Orleans' support, but I didn't see that as a racist remark.",

        "You know, 30 percent of some of these areas still don't have adequate power.",
        "A lot don't have adequate sewage.",

        "There were vast areas of middle to upper middle class housing that were also flooded, and they had their share of rich folks, white and black, living in them.",
        "There was an enclave of black millionaires that flooded out of New Orleans' East, so it isn't true that all of the damage was inflicted on the poor.",
        "But in a city with a lot of poor people and where 80 percent of the housing was flooded, a lot of poor people lost their houses."

        "I mean, I - you know, I don't know if this is a constructive contribution to the dialogue about New Orleans but it's been made often enough and it's been made by me to I think be something that has a life of its own, and I'll repeat it now: I don't believe that if New Orleans had been the River Oak section of Houston and if it had been George Bush's mother up on one of those rooftops or if it had been Greenwich, Connecticut or Shaker Heights, Ohio that it would have taken the federal government a week to get here.",
