        "Oh absolutely.",
        "I think there's a righteous skepticism about the affect of government and its intent for poor people.",
        "I think Juan is absolutely right that the storm was racially neutral in terms of its attack, but it was not racially neutral in terms of its consequence, and I think we have to draw distinction there that is both logical and ethical.",
        "Furthermore, I think the lingering suspicion among African-American people is wholly justified.",
        "One need not buy into wholesale theories of conspiracy where the government blew up the levees or some other malicious force imposed its will through dynamite.",
        "The intent of a conspiracy theory is to communicate a moral vision.",
        "That moral vision is black life just doesn't count as much as white life in this country.",
        "So I think that when Kanye West made the statement, what he was trying to suggest is that the government - he doesn't know George Bush individually.",
        "George Bush is the face of the government.",
        "How is care measured in political terms?",
        "The distribution of critical resources to vulnerable community in a timely fashion.",
        "And in that sense, the folk who are black and white able to take care of themselves are going to do well after the storm.",
        "Even though it affected them in a viscous fashion, they were able to gird up their loins and gather their resources and move forward with the good will of their communities.",
        "African-American people, and other poor peoples, by the way, are much more vulnerable and therefore less likely to be able to recover in the aftermath.",
        "That's the racial difference that we have to account for.",
        "Would you say - what would you say we learned from - in the aftermath of Katrina about race, if anything?",
        "Did we learn anything?",
        "Well yeah, I think it's absolutely clear that we have refused to engage in an edifying conversation about the convergence of race and class.",
        "We got some language for race in this country.",
        "We have less language for class, less analytical acuity, less clarity, and less willingness to engage these issues either within these communities and between communities.",
        "And I think that it appeared early on that with the outpouring of charity that Americans were willing to gird up their loins and put their resources squarely behind African-American and other poor people.",
        "What it turned out is that we got charity but no justice.",
        "Justice is about dealing with the structural realities that have to be contended with and why poor people had been left behind long before the vicious winds and violent waters of Katrina descended.",
        "And the vicious consequences of racial difference have to be acknowledged.",
        "And finally, I think that when you look at the stuff that Jed was speaking about earlier: the terrible rates of concentrated poverty.",
        "That means you live in a terrible neighborhood that has a lot of other poor people.",
        "You have poor schools.",
        "You have a terrible infrastructure.",
        "You don't have great levels of incentive to push beyond the immediacy of the horror, and as a result of that prison becomes your destiny and a date with a prison cell is nearly guaranteed by poor schools.",
        "So when you look at that all together, we just don't have the will to confront that.",
        "George Bush gave a great speech in the aftermath of Katrina.",
        "Had he matched it with public policy, we would have been further along one year later than we are now, and I'm afraid we just don't have the will to do so.",
        "What happened to that national will that seemed to be there, Juan, a year ago?",
        "I mean, if nothing else, there seemed at that moment - in this terrible moment of Katrina that people were saying, all right, we've been ignoring race now; we've been ignoring poverty.",
        "We're going to start talking about it again.",
        "We're going to start looking for solutions to this.",
        "And a year later that conversation doesn't seem to be going on really."

        "Here was an opportunity for us to say, well, really, what is the consequence of national policy with regard to poverty and how does it impact when you consider that so many of the poor disproportionately are people of color, in specific African-Americans?",
        "And instead what we did was we got locked into a polarizing racial conversation, with black people, as I said, having the kind of reaction that suggests of conspiracy theories, blow up levees and all the rest, and the Republican white man in the White House doesn't care about black people.",
        "And then you saw a response from the right that said, oh look at all the looters.",
        "These people are looters and not worthy of our sympathy; and look at the allegations of rape and slaughter in terms of the New Orleans Superdome and Convention Center.",
        "So much of that turned out to be fables.",
        "I mean absolute madness - not true, and that's what caught us in the mud and didn't allow that moment of conscience to truly flower.",

        "I think we had that kind of moment there, but we got lost.",
        "And even to this day people want to make the case somehow that, you know, it's about race.",
        "But, you know, if you looked at what people have done in terms of the studies subsequently, Lynn, what they find is, you know, 28 percent or so of New Orleans is made up of white people, but 33 percent of the people who died in New Orleans during Katrina were white.",
        "So even larger than their proportion.",
        "You think about the damage to property.",
        "You heard what Jed Horne said: There were areas in New Orleans' East - black millionaires wiped out.",
        "But whites were damaged as well.",
        "It's not just the Ninth Ward, but it's also St. Bernard Parish - overwhelmingly white.",
        "And yet the opportunity for the national conversation to come together in the way Jed Horne was talking about people on a local level saying hey, wait a minute, we've got a crisis here.",
        "We're all from New Orleans.",
        "We've got to build together.",
        "That conversation hasn't taken place on the national level because people I think have been trying to exploit it for political reasons or to make some larger point that's self-serving.",
        "Where should the conversation be now?",
        "What should we be talking about now, a year later?",
        "Well, you know, again, it's such a rich moment - the Katrina story.",

        "You know, a poverty rate overall of about 23 percent, but 35 percent in the black community.",
        "If you talk about black children in New Orleans, over 50 percent living in poverty - deeply entrenched poverty, generations of poverty.",
        "What happened during Katrina?",
        "We saw church groups go in to try to help people.",
        "We saw extended families say, hey, you can come live with us for a while.",
        "We saw neighboring states say we will help you with the displaced population.",
        "We saw big business say there are jobs elsewhere in the country.",
        "We saw educational institutions say come here to continue our education.",
        "If you talk about basic prescriptions for dealing with poverty, this doesn't only apply to Katrina, it could apply to the poor anywhere in America.",
        "Remember, a quarter of African-Americans live in poverty, Lynn.",
        "You have a higher concentration in New Orleans - a 70 percent black city at the time.",
        "It was deeply entrenched, and yet no one was dealing with these issues of poverty.",
        "No one was saying you've got to graduate high school.",
        "No one was saying don't have babies when you're teenagers and not ready to be a parent.",

        "That kind of conversation was not taking place in terms of really saying this is how we can end poverty in the United States in the 21st Century.",
        "Michael Eric Dyson, do you think that the discussions about race so far have been - the discussions that have taken place, and as we have been saying, perhaps they've tapered off now at this point - but were they too polarizing?",
        "I think, Juan, you seem to be indicating that you felt that maybe the discussion was polarizing.",
        "Do you think that they were polarizing?",
        "Well, unavoidably.",

        "It was extremely polarizing to communities.",
        "But ultimately the moral suasion that Dr. King brought to bear was able to convince of America at a critical point in our trajectory of democracy that this was the right thing to do.",
        "So polarization can never be the litmus test of whether it's authentic or legitimate or a good thing to pursue.",
        "However, I think that - I'm afraid that the haphazard formulations that Mr. Williams has put forth, in regard to what some of those solutions might be, may be part of the problem that perpetuates a legacy of such divisive thinking.",
        "For instance, it's not either or.",
        "It's not either that people assert personal responsibility as the predicate for removing the barriers, the impediments and the obstacles that block them from the path to success.",
        "Nor is it about ignoring the fact that structural features - low wages, severely depressed economy, the service economy, which has been extraordinarily exacerbated by tremendous political tensions.",
        "All of that stuff together means that people don't have the opportunity to exercise responsibility.",
        "Let me give you an example: I'm here in New Orleans, where I've been since last Friday, arguing, speaking, and participating in events.",
        "And I've taken tours of the Lower Ninth Ward.",
        "Home after home, I see young black people and working black people saying, look, we have trucks out here.",
        "We want to go out and remove cars.",
        "What happened is that the government had $100 million no-bid contracts to big corporations -be they Halliburton or Bechtel or Shaw or the like - they bid out the jobs, they prevent us on the local level from exercising our autonomy much less our responsibility.",
        "So those who want to exercise personal responsibility are prevented by structural features like no-bid contracts that prevent them from maximizing their potential.",
        "So that, to me, is writ large against the canvas of our racial lesson here.",
        "What you're talking about then is how can these people be helped?",
        "And one of the things that we have learned I think from Katrina is they have the power to help themselves, but when you understand...",

        "There has been a shift, a very subtle but very powerful one, from a war on poverty to the war on the poor.",
        "And the war on the poor that's being prosecuted I think is itself so deeply and fundamentally flawed that unless we renege upon our commitment to it, we will only perpetuate the devastation for the poor.",
