        "And the self-reporting is one thing.",
        "People self-report and say, yeah, I voted for the Democratic guy and it comes out that the Republican guy wins.",

        "Now, but beyond that, I think that the caller made an interesting point that Juan at least tipped his hat to but failed to wholly embrace.",
        "And that is the fact that, yeah, it doesn't always have to be about race but it's about race a lot of the times.",
        "And the fusion and merging of these two characteristics, race and class, is what makes things intriguing.",
        "It's true that race is a central factor of many aspects of our lives, as well as class, but I think race makes class hurt more.",
        "Even in the concentrated poverty of New Orleans, white brothers and sisters who are living in poverty don't live in the same kind of concentrated poverty that African-American brothers and sisters live in.",
        "Which means then that there are some effects that are exacerbatory(ph) that make it harsher for African-American people who live under the ostensibly same conditions that white brothers and sisters do.",
        "that, look, if you're poor, you can't get the same kind of justice because you don't have the resources.",
        "The point I made about the trucks, true enough, Juan is absolutely right.",
        "There could be some white guys who, because of the restrictions, don't have trucks.",
        "But all the guys owning the corporations that do the get bids happen to be white.",
        "And when you talk about that, there is a high degree of correlation between the contracts being distributed by the government, the largesse economically that is accruing to those who have businesses which are owned.",
        "And preexisting contracts are the basis for the distribution of the resource at first.",
        "That is to say if you already have a relationship with the government and you get the contract, you have a higher likelihood of being able in a crisis to respond.",
        "Those are overwhelmingly 99 percent white Americans.",
        "So I think it would be silly and insidious and just spiting our nose to cut off our face to suggest that race doesn't have a huge role in playing who gets the resources, how they get distributed, and finally, as the gentleman said who called, the advocates for the poor are barely as loud and abrasive as those who are willing to stigmatize them and those who defend the interests of the dominant society.",

        "My point is if we are truly looking for this moment, you know, Katrina even a year later to be instructive, to allow us to be productive in dealing with poverty issues, Lynn, then we have go to say where is the consensus for action?",
        "How can we say to people across racial lines this is a shame when we in America look and see these people in desperate conditions not being helped by our government; that's wrong.",
        "How can we take action?",
        "And that's why I come back to the idea that if you look at the poll numbers, these polls done by Pew - Pew is a very legitimate, reputable organization - if you look at it, what you see is that black people - remember, 25 percent of black Americans live in poverty -when you ask black people basic questions about whether or not the poor are overly dependent, they're saying yes.",
        "When you ask them basic questions about whether or not black people who are not moving ahead are creating their own problems, black people who live next door, whose, you know, family, friends, neighbors are sometimes poor black people are saying yes.",

        "What are the steps, what are the prescriptions that we can take in order to alleviate poverty in America today, and that's the conversation I'd like to have rather than the finger pointing.",
        "Well both of you - the two of you seem to be representing two sides of -not two sides but two lines of thought that have crystallized in this debate.",
        "You, Juan, sort of talking about personal responsibility, the need for personal responsibility; and you, Michael Eric Dyson, talking about the fact that there's institutional racism, that this is part of our culture, it's part of -and that the government response we saw in New Orleans perhaps reflected that.",
        "Isn't that sort of the debate that was going on before Katrina...",
        "It's the same old stuck-in-the-mud debate, and there's just no evidence, for example, that FEMA's response, the government's response, was racism so much as ineptitude.",
        "Mr.",
        "Dyson, is it the same old debate?",
        "Can you change the discussion now?",

        "Juan, the same old debate.",
        "You're saying that it - but this question of personal responsibility which you are articulating, that's something that people have been talking about for a number of years now as well.",
        "Oh, it's in the tradition of black leadership in the country, but it hasn't been in this generation.",
        "Instead I think there's been this focus, this tremendous focus on victimization to my mind, and I think it's a real lost opportunity.",
        "Because what it does is it breaks down - you think of, Lynn, the glory of the civil rights movement as a movement that was trying to establish equality and justice for all.",
        "It was kind of move us beyond race.",
        "That's why you had people, you know, without regard to race or religion coming together to form what was the greatest social movement the country has every seen.",
        "At the moment, instead we have people in our community who want to focus on victimization, who want to make it about race instead of saying wait a second, how is it that we as Americans can act on this problem?",

        "So we stigmatize the notion of victimhood so that those who are actual victims - if you've been subjected to cancer and you say, well, we're against people who call themselves cancer survivors or cancer victims, well there's a deleterious pathogen in your body that is eating you away cell by cell.",
        "So those who have been literally victimized by the forces of oppression are now re-victimized because they're denied access to the very language that could express the horror of the tragedy of what has occurred to them.",
        "But beyond that, Juan's own polls contradict the very notion of victimhood's wide and pervasive spread among African-American people.",
        "First of all, black people have always been bifocal.",
        "They look at the fact that we must be responsible for our lives and that the dependence upon government is something we should be discouraged from.",
        "Marcus Garvey was about that, Booker T.",
        "Washington was about that, Frederick Douglass was about that, Martin Luther King, Jr. was about that, and so every leader worth his or her salt - Ella Baker, Jo Ann Robinson, and the like - have discouraged us from being overly reliant upon the government, but they have not shirked from demanding that the government be responsible for what they are to be responsible for so that we are both victims, survivors and agents at the same time.",
        "The same group of people who have been victimized by historical legacies of white supremacy, social injustice and economic inequality have to have a resonant language to articulate their blight and their predicament.",
        "But at the same time they have exercised extraordinary responsibility in arguing against the very premises that would deny them legitimacy as, you know, in American society."

        "And finally what's interesting to me - it is not that people are going around as African-American people are crying victimhood and we can't do anything.",
        "I've been down here on the ground in the Lower Nine, and people have been nearly heroic in insisting that despite the fact that their government will show up, A, they need for it to show up, B, what we don't talk about is that these African-American people by and large have demanded of themselves a level of accountability and responsibility that the government has not nearly begun to match.",
        "If George Bush was as responsible as the average black person I have seen down here on the ground, this government would not be besieged by ineptitude, by extraordinary cronyism, by corrosive cynicism about the possibility of the government responding to the issues of African-American people.",
        "And let me say this finally.",
        "When it comes to the notion of victimization, the truth is that African-American people have lived in a society where their legitimate rights and claims upon the state have rarely been acknowledged.",
