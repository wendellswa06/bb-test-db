        "So the very thing that we fear about computers is actually, you're saying, the thing that makes them good?",
        "That's right, Steve.",

        "So imagine a day when it's not just the GPS in your car, but the car itself is a self-driving car.",
        "The first time one of these cars causes a major crash, we're going to say, what genius thought that we could trust an algorithm to drive a car?",
        "The problem is we're making a false comparison between a world where machines make mistakes and a world where mistakes never happen.",
        "The real comparison ought to be between how often self-driving cars make mistakes and how often human drivers make mistakes.",
        "I wonder if there's another factor that comes into play here because you said one other reason that we trust humans is we presume that humans can learn.",
        "Aren't we entering a world in which the algorithms themselves will be learning more and more?",
        "The issue we just heard about is also making news in suburban Seattle.",
        "A Catholic school there apparently fired a staff member for being in a same-sex marriage.",
        "NPR's Martin Kaste has more.",
        "In fact, I think we've already entered that world, Steve.",
        "Algorithms not only learn, but they learn very well.",
        "So one of the things that computers are very good at doing is quickly learning how much weight to attach to the different components of a decision.",
        "So if you have students applying to law school, the computer might be able to say, here's how much attention you pay to their grades in college, to their LSAT scores, to their recommendation letters.",
        "Now, of course, many of us are comfortable with algorithms making decisions for other people.",
        "We just don't like it when algorithms make decisions about us.",
        "(Laughter) Don't make a decision about my law school application.",
        "Precisely.",
        "Because we think we're unique and special, how can it possibly be that an algorithm can judge us?",

        "The definition of North American folk music in the early 20th century was music made by whites of European ancestry, and it's the definition Bascom Lamar Lunsford used when he started the Mountain Dance and Folk Festival in Ashville in 1928.",

        "In determining what was traditional and not traditional, The National often broke barriers.",
        "W.C.",
        "Handy, known as the father of the blues, played the festival in 1938, his first performance on a desegregated stage.",
        "Audiences were exposed to Cajun, polka and the music of Chinese immigrants.",
        "Over the decades, the festival moved around the country.",
        "As it traveled, Olin says, the festival also moved with the times.",

        "Before the Christmas break, many of them walked out of class, and they held raucous protests on Zmuda's behalf.",
        "One rally attracted the newly elected mayor of Seattle, Ed Murray.",
        "He's also in a same-sex marriage.",
