        "The bottom line of Iranian government would be covered by this case inside of Iran, and at the same time it shows confidence and trust to other countries, which they are concerned about nuclear activities of Iran.",
        "These technical fixes would be accompanied by a commitment from the U.S.",
        "not to attack Iran, broad political dialogue between the two countries, solid verification measures, and a halt to Iran's own uranium enrichment activities.",
        "Both Bunn and Maleki acknowledge that at the moment there is little inclination to compromise on either side.",
        "From the U.S.",
        "vantage point, it seems especially difficult to sort out what policies Iran's leaders really are pursuing, with constant contradictory comments coming from Tehran.",

        "And you need all three components, so different groups can provide different pieces.",
        "Or, one group can provide all three pieces.",
