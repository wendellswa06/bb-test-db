        "And later on, he went to a house party.",
        "And he's really focusing on this sort of smaller events and getting to know the voters and also trying to get people to see him passed, maybe, the conversation around 9/11.",
        "Here's a cut of him sort of making that appeal.",
        "I'm not talking just about September 11th 2001, although that is part of my history and part of what I had to handle.",

        "I think you're going to be looking to see how much attacking there might be on Senator John McCain.",
        "You know, in past debates, when people thought he wasn't doing so well, there was a lot of praise heaped on Senator McCain.",
        "This time around, you've got former Governor Mitt Romney, who's coming back looking to rebound and really looking to, let's say, draw appointed differences between the candidates.",
        "And well, we also see alliances, where we see former Governor Mike Huckabee and McCain maybe being a little nicer to each other and piling it on on Romney.",
