        "Let's start with the situation at the airport.",
        "What do we know about the suspended flights and what this could mean?",
        "Well, this is one of the busiest airports in Asia.",
        "Police said there are now about 5,000 protesters there.",
        "And now because flights have been canceled, protesters are worried that the police may try to flush them out by force.",
        "And it's not clear whether this was a government strategy or not, but it certainly inconveniences a lot of people.",
        "And it could have - could be part of a strategy to, you know, pin it on the protesters and make it make it seem like they're disrupting people's lives.",
        "So how violent were these clashes over the weekend?",
        "I mean, you were out there.",
        "Take me to the streets.",

        "Well, what happens in these sort of hit-and-run, guerrilla-style protests is the protesters get out there and they barricade the streets.",
        "They throw stones and Molotov cocktails at police.",
        "Then the police come in firing tear gas and rubber bullets.",
        "They beat protesters with batons.",
        "They arrest some of them.",
        "They clear the streets, and then they reopen them to traffic.",
        "And then the remaining protesters move on to the next district, and this repeated itself over and over again in many downtown areas, about four of them yesterday.",
        "So it just keeps on going, very fast and fluid.",
        "So the police response you're describing, I mean, it sounds like, I mean, potentially police brutality.",
        "How are people handling that question?",
        "A lot of people here sure see it that way.",
        "They feel that the police did a lot of unnecessary beating, firing of rubber bullets and tear gas at close range.",
        "They even fired tear gas into the subway, where it's hard for those gases to disperse.",
        "Oh, wow.",
        "There were also allegations that undercover cops dressed as protesters were stirring up violence, which riot police then moved in to quell.",
        "Now, the police say they're just, you know, responding to threats to their safety, they used minimum force to disperse the protesters.",
        "There have been scores of injuries we hear about over the weekend.",
        "There have not been fatalities.",
        "But people perceive this as brutality, and this fueled a big turnout of protesters at the airport."

        "But the police managed to keep them apart.",
        "They blocked off the streets, and there were no big fights.",
