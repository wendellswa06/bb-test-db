        "Ten years ago, as this country was headed towards the Great Recession, Joshua Ferris tapped into the fear that gripped white collar workers with his first novel \"\"Then We Came To An End.\"\" It was a darkly funny take on what happens when everyone at an office could be fired.",
        "And the book became a bestseller.",

        "So you set aside the novel and you think OK, well, here it goes.",
        "And then, of course, you get two weeks into it, and you think this is just as bad as the novel.",
        "A short story, says Ferris, should feel a little like a dream, sometimes a dream that becomes a nightmare.",
        "It also has to hit a perfect balance between leaving the reader wanting more and still feeling satisfied."
