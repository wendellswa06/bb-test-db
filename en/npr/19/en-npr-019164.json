        "A lot of these candidates are appealing quite strongly to the Democratic base, which frankly is a lot more liberal than your group, the DLC.",

        "We're not too worried about a Democrat winning a primary.",
        "We know that the Democrats are good at winning primaries.",
        "The question is whether we can win the general elections.",
        "Bruce, if you could build a Democratic presidential candidate for this upcoming race from scratch, what would that candidate be like?",
        "My old boss Bill Clinton has always said that the most important aspect of any candidate is that they can make a good case to the country and that whether they are good speaker or where they come from or what they look like is not nearly as important at the end of the day as whether they can win the debate against the other side.",
        "And that's why I think we are in terrific shape.",
        "Finally, Bruce, I've got to ask.",
        "You're going to be in Nashville, city of music, Bill Clinton showing up.",
        "Is he going to bring his saxophone?",
        "You guys going to go hit the town at night?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "You know, the competition in Nashville is pretty steep, but maybe for old times' sake we'll get out the shades and the saxophone and he can jam a little.",
        "Bruce Reed is president of the Democratic Leadership Council.",

        "President Trump also told Bloomberg News yesterday that he sees the Mueller Russia investigation as illegal.",
        "And this comes as another lobbyist was charged today with failing to register as a foreign agent, a spinoff from the Russia investigation.",
        "So, Bre, do you think this is more of the same of what we've been seeing from President Trump, or do you think he's actually gearing up to make a move?",
        "I think he's been saying this for the past year - that the investigation has been stretching forward.",
        "I mean, I don't know if we could go a month without a tweet or a comment from Donald Trump expressing frustration that Jeff Sessions decided to recuse himself over this ordeal.",
        "I think that this isn't really anything new coming from the president.",
        "And I think also, to put this in context, every single Trump rally that I've ever seen - and I know you've watched quite a few as someone whose job it is to do that - every single time, he talks about the election and how he beat Hillary and the Election Night for 15 minutes pretty much every single rally like this.",
        "So this is something that is very, very deeply, you know, personal to him.",
        "And so I think to see that this investigation is still open is, like, a really big insult, right?",
        "But...",
        "And so I think, like, his instinct to kind of want to cauterize it and publicly critique it is something that we've seen a lot of.",
        "But, boy, the divide between last night in Indiana where the crowd was chanting lock her up about Hillary Clinton - at the same time, four people connected to the Trump campaign or administration have pleaded guilty to criminal charges.",
        "Plus his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort is behind bars.",
        "Ana, it's like people are existing in two separate realities.",
        "It's been that way for quite some time now.",
        "But what I find fascinating is how his tone has changed a little bit.",
        "And what I mean by that is, you know, before, I feel like he was more willing to work with people around him in order to tackle this whole Russia investigation, and now he's sort of isolating himself within his Cabinet.",
        "He is moving forward with things in a very unilateral way.",
        "And there, you know, is this question about whether or not he is going to do things that would further provide evidence of obstruction of justice even though those around him are urging him not to do it.",
        "What I think is even more interesting is that the numbers - poll numbers in regard to this investigation have changed quite a bit.",
        "So a new Washington Post-ABC poll indicates that 63 percent of Americans actually support the Mueller investigation.",
        "So even though Trump is a great marketer and has done a pretty good job at persuading the American public in the past, I think that he's starting to really fail in getting this message across amongst the American people."

        "Bre, what do you see as McGahn's legacy?",
        "Well, traditionally speaking, he has been someone who at every step along the way has been kind of putting the brakes on things that Donald Trump has wanted to do, right?",
        "Like, when it came to talking about firing Sessions or when it came to talking about firing Mueller, he was kind of like, hey, hey, maybe let's calm down; let's take a breath; let's see, you know, and maybe not do that right away.",
        "So it will be interesting going forward if with his departure we see kind of a more unrestrained version of Donald Trump.",

        "I mean, when you have incredibly weak Democrats like Chuck Schumer brokering a deal with Mitch McConnell to fast-track the confirmation of federal judges, you don't really need Don McGahn to help the Republican cause here.",
        "You know, I am a Democrat, but it is pretty devastating to see what's going on with Democrats in the Senate right now in regard to federal judges.",

        "Ana, what are you going to be looking for in those hearings next week?",
        "I take those hearings with a grain of salt because I think that we've seen on multiple occasions individuals who are waiting for confirmation answering questions in deceptive ways and still getting confirmed.",
        "I think that Brett Kavanaugh will easily get confirmed, and there are so many issues on the line.",
        "Of course people love to bring up reproductive issues on a federal level.",
        "But I think that, you know, on a state level, it's something that we should all really consider because we have a number of red states that have fought tooth and nail to, you know, outlaw reproductive rights and abortion and, in some cases, affordable contraception.",
        "And I think that, you know, with Kavanaugh's confirmation, it's something that's really in jeopardy right now.",
        "Bre, there does seem to be this strange divide between the amount that could change in the country based on Kavanaugh's confirmation and the relative lack of suspense about next week's confirmation hearings."

        "I think in a way, that elevates their own personal profile.",
