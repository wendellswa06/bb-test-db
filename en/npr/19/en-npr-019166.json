        "She came to visit my parents, who were very involved in the NAACP in Tucson, and I will never forget - it still brings tears to my eyes - the image of we were at a rally, an NAACP rally, and here's my grandmother holding hands with people who she never thought she could talk to or should talk to, singing \"\"We Shall Overcome.",
