        "Do you need to be there to understand?",
        "I think yesterday was so important going to the White House and hearing them sing and speak because they are living history, and a lot of us aren't going to get a chance to be in the room with them and hear them, and that was so important just to feel the genuineness of the songs that your were singing.",
        "It came from your heart, you know, it wasn't rehearsed.",

        "Hmm.",
        "I think too there is a there is so much music in the contemporary situation.",
        "And you really feel you are accessing, you know, music for all over the place, but if you fit in the singing of the Freedom Singers, you actually are introduced to another kind of musical sonic power.",
        "And in this case it was unaccompanied in terms of not having a lot of electrical instruments, but there was no question that it actually filled all of the air in the room.",
        "And we are blessed that we can have access to sing from other periods.",
        "But the one thing I think is very important is not to suggest to young people that because we did get some achievements and we don't have as much overt racism, they have an easier time, because I find that every period has its challenges.",
        "And I hope that all young people search for the contribution they can make in their time to change things for the better, and that's a generational work that has to be identified by every young generation.",
        "And I want to get to calls.",
        "And I know there's people waiting who are impatient, and I apologize.",
        "But I did want to ask our young visitor, Sierra, do you think that's true, that the kids your age think that there's still that work to be done, that this time is as challenging as these times that we're talking about now?",
        "I wouldn't say it's as challenging.",
        "I would say it was challenging in a different way.",
        "My teacher at school, Mr. Mark Williams(ph), he asks me all the time, what are you about?",
        "You know, this our generation, we have to look for what our civil rights issue is.",

        "You are empowering in a kind of rhythm and rising voice.",
        "So I think you're on to a very important thing, but be sure to look at those disciplines, they're going to help you analyze that speech.",
