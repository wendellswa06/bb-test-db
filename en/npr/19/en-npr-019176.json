        "What it adds up to is pretty much the same strategy as President Obama.",

        "They're really focused on Iraq.",
        "That's the de facto capital of the Islamic State 'cause that's where operations against the West are being planned, suicide attacks and the like.",
        "And they're going to move forward on that in the coming weeks.",
        "And also, President Obama said back in 2011, Assad must go.",
        "And then John Kerry as secretary of state kind of backed away from that.",
        "But the only way that's going to happen is by working with Russia.",
        "When you say the same policy as Obama - Obama's policy in effect was Assad must go, but we're not really sure how we want to do that.",
        "So we're not really going to try that hard.",
        "They were pushing.",
        "They were working through Moscow to get rid of Assad over time.",
        "It's a political settlement."

        "But going forward, leaders of both parties say there needs to be a conversation, an engagement with Congress, and you need to tell us what your long-term plan is more than one step at a time.",
