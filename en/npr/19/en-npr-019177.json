        "Hey.",
        "OK.",
        "So why the delay?",
        "Well, the industry has been raising all kinds of concerns about this rule for years as it was being crafted.",
        "And we should note - none of these are new concerns, but they say one thing is that, OK, a financial adviser - it might be harder to work with somebody who hasn't saved up that much money if they can't make as much money working with them.",
        "Donald Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn - he was very recently the president of Goldman Sachs - he's come out saying this is a bad rule.",
        "Supporters disagree with all this, but the president has gone ahead to delay it.",
        "I think you've touched on one reason that there would be a delay now.",
        "This is an Obama-era rule that's being changed, or revisited, I guess, would be the word by the new administration.",
        "But people still wonder why this wasn't already the rule.",
        "Why wouldn't you be required to act in the best interest of the person who's giving you money?",
        "Well, a lot of people always assumed that was the case.",
        "The fact is, though, that many Americans get bad advice because their financial advisers are not required to act in their best interest.",
        "And too often what happens is an adviser gets paid more money to steer you into investments that have very high fees because they get a bigger commission, just like any salesman...",
        "It's in their interest, yeah.",
        "Somewhere along the line, his larger user base began to be people who, either they understood it was a joke and they still enjoyed it or they just didn't get it or they just didn't care.",
        "Like, people really loved their cows.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "So the Obama administration looked into this.",
        "They said - whoa, this is costing Americans $17 billion that's being leached out of their retirement accounts, and they said this is totally not OK.",
        "They spent years crafting this rule, and it requires financial advisers to act in their clients' best interests.",
        "Couple seconds - is the rule really delayed as we're saying, or is it pretty much actually dead?",
        "Well, you might think it's dead.",
        "There's this executive order to look into it, and that is the $17 billion question, I guess we could say.",
        "But look, the president's other executive orders have run into some trouble, as you remember.",
        "And supporters here - there are a lot of them.",
        "They're powerful - the AARP..."

        "Right.",

        "OK.",

        "The timing was interesting.",
        "Just as Vladimir Putin was ceremoniously installing his protégé, Dmitri Medvedev as president and himself as prime minister, it became known that the Russian government had ordered the expulsion of three American diplomats and military attaches and that two Russian diplomats in the United States had also been expelled.",
        "The tit-for-tat expulsion started last November and it was not clear in what order that it happened, why they happened or why the news had been withheld by both governments for so long.",
        "One senses a whiff of the Cold War, and one of its favorite instruments, PNG - persona non-grata - or person not welcome.",
        "Let me mention in passing that in 1957, as a CBS correspondent in Moscow, I was labeled persona non-grata for having violated Soviet censorship rules by attempting to broadcast forbidden information.",
        "The diplomats PNGed in those days were usually accused of espionage, a charge broad enough to include an innocent conversation with a Russian on the street.",
        "And tit-for-tat was the name of the game - one Russian expelled for every American expelled.",
        "The Russian government has also been conducted a miniature Cold War with Britain.",
        "Last year the British government sought the extradition of former KGB officer Andrei Lugovoy, accused of the radiation poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, a Kremlin critic.",
        "Russia refused to extradite Lugovoy, and in retaliation, the British government's suspended operations of these two officers, a foreign ministry spokesman said, the British side has finally done what had to be done a long time ago.",
        "This all has a little chill about it.",
        "It is as though the Putin/Medvedev regime, flushed with oil, has decided to assert itself and command a little respect from the Western world.",
        "This is Daniel Schorr."
