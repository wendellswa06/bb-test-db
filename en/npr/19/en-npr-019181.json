        "Abilities like memory, basic motor skills, start to falter - almost like a dementia that hits young people.",
        "Then there's what scientists call salience - roughly, something that matters.",
        "To a person without schizophrenia, a distant car alarm is not salient.",
        "It can be ignored.",
        "But, says Sophia Vinogradov, many people with schizophrenia can't do that.",
        "They are walking down the street, trying to have a conversation, and their brain is being flooded with the sound of the door slamming, the airplane going overhead.",
        "And the brain is starting to process all of that information as if it has meaning and is something the brain needs to pay attention to and needs to do something about.",
        "And maybe - though this is just a theory- this onslaught of extra data becomes raw material for hallucinations.",
        "And as the brain takes in all this information, which really is not salient, but it thinks is salient, it tries to make sense of it.",
        "And there's some evidence to suggest that that's what gives rise to delusional ideas, to paranoia, to hallucinatory activity and so forth.",
        "Considered this way, schizophrenia sounds like a disease in which the stream of consciousness has swollen into a tsunami.",
        "And you can hear this, I think, when you talk to Paul, another guy I met at the clinic.",
        "Paul is an Asian man in his 50s who looked quizzically at my microphone.",
        "And I'll warn you, he's really hard to understand.",

        "Everything I say to Paul, or he says to me, triggers a jumble of tangentially related ideas - Punjab leads to India leads to books leads to his brother Kenny..."

        "The hand-written text was then set in print.",
