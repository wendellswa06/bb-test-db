        "These bans didn't apply to paper bags.",
        "OK.",

        "They will eventually break down.",

        "That's why Taylor says banning plastic shopping bags ends up increasing greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "So I would say this leaves us with nothing, but there is a kind of bag that I use all the time.",

        "OK, Greg.",
        "But, like, we can't just carry things around in our arms.",
        "Like, what are we supposed to do?",
        "You should reuse the same bag over and over again.",
        "Now, that bag should probably not be organic cotton.",

        "But then there's kind of the broader policy question.",
        "Taylor thinks a fee is smarter than a ban.",
        "That's because they're both equally effective when it comes to the goal of encouraging reuse.",
        "So about 50% of customers begin using reusable bags under both a ban and under a fee."
