        "Immigration is a huge issue.",

        "I mean, this is a learned behavior that I would argue is not natural for a 13-year-old, and he's clearly getting, you know, points in terms of how they act and how they interact with folks from a larger society.",
        "And I think it's very easy for us to say let's just send him away for 60 years or let's just kill him et cetera, et cetera, you know, via the death penalty and still not have to deal with the very complicated issues of why a 13-year-old boy would think it would be perfectly natural to treat a young girl that way.",
        "Shay, where should the debate go from here because there's constantly debates over rehabilitation versus long sentences, sentences that punish versus sentences that reflect the age of the criminal?",

        "Sure, this young man shows every tendency of being a sexual predator and there's no place to put him except in prison, and that's a shame, but I would rather have him behind bars than walking out on the street.",
