        "So now the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is set to brief your counterparts on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week.",
        "So what are you hoping that he will discuss with your colleagues on the Senate side?",
        "And I'm also wondering if you're hoping that he will also come to the House side and similarly brief you.",
        "No.",
        "I think he needs to brief both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, which, as you're aware, I sit.",
        "And I think he also ought to brief the Intelligence Committee where Will Hurd sits.",
        "We have significant concerns, Michel.",
        "We cannot be sending any ambiguous messages on behalf of any branch of the United States government to the world about how we view Vladimir Putin.",
        "He is a KGB thug.",
        "Let's make no mistake about it.",
        "He can't be trusted.",
        "He's a master manipulator.",
        "And what this man has done and his regime has sowed seeds of discord throughout the world in order to create chaos and fill vacuums thereafter.",
        "And it's a very serious threat.",
        "We cannot be harsh enough with our sanctions.",
        "I will support virtually any bill that comes before the House that, A, protects our electoral system from future hacks and attempted hacks and also that sanctions the Russian oligarchs and the Russian regime to the greatest extent.",
        "Do you have any understanding or have you gotten any information from any source in the administration about what happened in that meeting?",
        "We don't, which is a problem.",
        "We need to be given information as to what transpired, what was said, what wasn't said and what the takeaways were because, you know, we have a responsibility to our constituents.",
        "The issue of Russian aggression and Russian interference with our election is an area of significant concern to my constituents, and I'm sure everybody's across the country.",
        "And we need to be able to answer to them, and we can only answer to them if we know and get briefed on what the contents of that meeting were.",
        "And, going back to the issue of sanctions, which you also raised, that you have consistently pushed for more sanctions on Russia.",
        "And there has been some action on this.",
        "But, overall, do you think that there's a sense of urgency about that in the administration?",
        "There's not nearly enough.",
        "I can tell you that.",
        "You know, I have complete confidence in our intelligence community.",
        "I used to be part of that intelligence community.",
        "Their assessment of what happened in the 2016 election has not changed, and my confidence in their assessment has not changed.",
        "I think we need to be far more aggressive.",
        "And the concern, Michel, is that anytime any member of the United States government, particularly someone in the administration, particularly the president, sends mixed signals to the world about the significance of the threat that Russia poses and the reality of what every single person in the intelligence community - these are unanimous conclusions, by the way - that there was, at a bare minimum, an attempt to interfere with our election.",
        "And they do that not just here in the United States - they do it around the world.",
        "That needs to be a stated fact.",
        "It needs to be just accepted as fact by everybody in our government because we need to respond to that reality, and it's a significant threat.",
        "We cannot let that happen again.",
        "That's Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick.",
        "He is a Republican from Pennsylvania.",
        "Congressman, thanks so much for talking with us."
