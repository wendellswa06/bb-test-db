        "Thanks for having me on the show.",

        "Ron, always good to have you on the program.",
        "Good to be here, Neal.",
        "And Constanze Stelzenmuller, let me turn to you first.",
        "Clearly, one of the audiences that Barack Obama was addressing was in Berlin and in Europe today, and you'd have to think that from watching the television coverage and seeing the crowd waiving American flags, the receptions was rapturous.",
        "Yeah, it was very attentive.",
        "It was very, very interested and I think people who came away very impressed.",
        "I actually met a German parliamentarian leaving the speech and he said, you know nobody here could have drawn this kind of crowd to this place.",
        "Nobody there could have drawn that kind of crowd.",
        "It is astonishing, Ron Elving, from an American's point of view, to see a huge crowd gathered in a European capital waiving American flags.",
        "There has to be something of a curiosity factor, but we have seen over and over in the polls in recent weeks and months that Barack Obama - if he's something of a phenomenon in this country is truly a phenomenon in Europe.",
        "People are fascinated with him.",
        "He's a new kind of American politician.",
        "It is, of course, partially his race.",
        "But it's also his age, it's the nature of his rhetoric, the nature of his vision, the nature of the way that he is actually talking about a kind of international approach to problems which I think is highly popular in Europe.",
        "And I was going to just ask Constanze Stelzenmuller about that.",
        "No one nation, no matter how large or powerful, can defeat such challenges alone.",
        "That is a message that many in Europe have longed to hear.",
        "It's a remarkable statement.",
        "An admission that even the world's sole remaining super power finds itself faced with challenges that it cannot defeat on its own and certainly not with military might.",
        "To be fair, I think the Bush administration in recent years has come to realize that; and if not saying so, has certainly acted on that understanding, on that insight.",
        "But to have it said in the middle of Berlin in Tiergarten in such a historic place is extraordinarily meaningful of course.",
        "Yet, he also challenged Europeans and specifically Germans.",
        "Earlier in the day, he'd met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and one of the things they talked about was Afghanistan, and she had said no, no more German troops are going to Afghanistan, and he called for German troops to be sent to Afghanistan."

        "The truth of the matter here in Germany is that we too are moving into an election year.",
        "The federal elections will be in September 2009, country's run by a very fractious grand coalition between the conservative and social Democrats.",
        "And the public is critical of this.",

        "Yes, it's an image.",
        "It's a video image.",
        "It's a photographic image and he also invoked a couple of other historic images in his remarks today, talking about the Ich Bin Berliner speech note that John F.",
        "Kennedy gave in 1961 when he visited Berlin and the shadow of another Berlin Wall crisis.",
        "Then of course, he talked about Ronald Reagan and the famous, Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall speech, in the 1980s which of course did lead to the eventual destruction of the Berlin Wall, not so much literally by Mikhail Gorbachev as by the Berliners themselves.",
        "The Germans themselves in an atmosphere that Mr. Gorbachev helped to create.",
        "And he also made reference of course to the Berlin airlift of 1948, quite a historical sweep 60 years in taking an awful a lot of history, a lot of changed relationships between a lot of different countries.",
        "Illustrating among other things, that no matter how great the challenge of a particular time may seem it can be overcome with the kind of consorted action we've seen in the past and the kind of political leadership that we've seen in the past.",
        "Constanze Stelzenmuller, the opposition in this country is trying to portray Barack Obama as inexperienced, a man who will have hard time finding his feet in foreign affairs given his performances.",
        "Germans have watched it from the Middle East and now to Berlin.",
        "How's he doing?",
        "It seems to me that hitherto he hasn't set a foot amiss during this trip from what I've seen.",
        "He's behaved in an exemplary way, not crossing anyone, not making any mistakes.",
        "And the great challenge of this speech, of course, was to straddle the transatlantic, if you will, rhetorically.",
        "Appealing both to Americans and to Europeans, and to the Americans in the audience.",
        "Don't forget they're about 20,000 Americans living in those (unintelligible) and I bet some of them were waving those American flags.",
        "But the other interesting part of the speech was, of course, that it wasn't just a speech about history as Mr. Elving just said very, very rightly.",
        "It was also a very modern speech.",
        "It was about globalization.",
        "What he was saying was that we have overcome the challenges of the 20th century together.",
        "But now the 21st century, we find ourselves faced with issues, with challenges, where we realize we really are intertwined.",
        "We no longer are separate and therefore we must deal with these responsibilities together.",
        "That's a very appealing message in Europe, where the European union has brought people together in a way with the unknown in the rest of the world.",
        "Constanze Stelzenmuller of the German Martial Fund in Berlin, Ron Elving of NPR News here in Washington, and you're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",

        "Hi.",
        "I'm an American who's been living in Berlin for 22 years.",
        "I was one of the very many Americans that went to see Barack Obama this evening.",
        "And I was, first of all, I was struck by the number of young people that were in the audience.",

        "So I was, first of all, amazed at the youth of the people who came to see him.",
        "That was one comment I had.",
        "And the second comment was that because of this youth, I think when he talked about the reasons why Germans love the United States, the reason they have namely the airlift, the support of Berlin.",
        "These young people know this mostly from history and when he talked about how much he loved America, I heard a definite rumble go through the audience.",
        "That doesn't go over so well with young Germans.",
        "I couldn't imagine a young German ever saying, I love Germany.",
        "He would be labeled right-wing extremist if he did that.",
        "That's interesting.",
        "Ron Elving, that part of the speech though may have been intended for the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.",
        "Yes, indeed, as many parts clearly were.",
        "There was another moment where, as the caller probably also observed, he said America has not perfected itself, but the reaction of the crowd at that point was a little bit, not exactly jeering, but that there was a little bit of that same spirit of, yeah, no kidding, from the audience particularly I imagine of those younger Germans.",
        "And Augie, what did you think of the speech?",
        "Well, I liked it.",
        "I think I was expecting a little bit more of a campaign speech than something that was so general.",
        "I mean, it was of course, from that content, it was, it was very moving.",
        "It was a very moving speech, but I was kind of expecting a few comments about John McCain.",
        "I was expecting a few comments about George W.",
        "Bush, but I guess it's diplomatically improper for him to criticize his government in another country.",
        "It wasn't quite what I was expecting.",
        "Well, Constanze Stelzenmuller, he began his speech by saying I'm here as a proud citizen of the United States... Ms. STELZENMULLER: Yes.",
        "A fellow citizen of the world as a candidate for president.",
        "I speak to you though not as a candidate for president.",
        "And it seemed to be that he was trying to pull off the statesman-like role and very much, speak as if were the president of the United States.",
        "Well, in a sense, you know, you really had to cross all, you take off all the boxes I think is the expression.",
        "And I think that that was an almost impossible task, and I think he fulfilled it almost perfectly, frankly, really.",
        "He appealed to history, he appealed to modern sensibilities and fears and hopes.",
        "He appealed to the Americans and to the Europeans.",
        "I'm not sure I agree with the caller that for somebody, an American presidential candidate to say he's proud of America, we wouldn't think of that as right-wing.",
        "I think that's perfectly okay for somebody to do.",
        "And you know, the German I think have learned to be a little more relaxed about themselves in recent years, with the soccer World Cup and other things as well.",
        "But I think his - he got a very, very respectful audience.",
        "And as I said, I don't know of a German politician who could draw 200,000 people in the middle of Berlin on a perfect balmy day.",
