        "We're going to put you on a carbon diet.",

        "You may be surprised to learn that some of the actions that you thought that you were doing to lower carbon emissions actually are increasing them, compared to other things you might be doing.",

        "Anybody can find the one nearest them just by typing in that Web site, stepitup07.org, and putting in their zip code; and up will pop somehow all the ones in a 50-mile radius.",
        "It's incredibly exciting.",
        "And what is the central message?",
        "The central message - everyone agrees all those rallies are all taking as their sole premise the idea that Congress should cut carbon emissions in this country 80 percent by 2050.",
        "The ways that people are figuring out how to get that message across differ completely depending on where they are.",
        "So off the Florida Keys there's people, scuba divers underwater who will be holding an underwater demonstration off the endangered coral reef.",
        "A little further up the coast, people in Jacksonville are convening in the parking lot of the NFL football stadium.",
        "They've got a crane where they're hoisting a yacht 20 feet in the air to show where the sea level's going to be.",
        "Here in Manhattan, at midday, people are crowding into the Battery in blue shirts to form a kind of sea of people that shows where the new tideline will be.",
        "Out West there's skiers descending in formation down the dwindling glaciers or people hiking up to the Hollywood sign, which almost burned down last week because they've had such a dry spring that, you know, the brushfires are already started.",
        "So everyone agrees on the message and everyone agrees on the urgency that, having wasted 20 years, we no longer can afford small half measures.",
        "The time has come for some actual political leadership on this.",
        "And the good news is there's at least 35 or 40 senators and representatives who are joining tomorrow to speak at these rallies or to join in these marches.",
        "And there's some sign that we're beginning to make a little progress in Washington."

        "Well, I think the one that's got most attention over here is my calculation about the amount of fossil fuel used to drive a couple of miles in a car compared to the energy used in walking.",
        "What I try to show is that the industrialization of the Western food system, the fact that we're pouring fertilizers and we're processing food, we're erecting huge shops with fast energy consumptions to sell it, meaning that if you drink a glass of milk to replenish the energy you lost in that two-mile walk, you're consuming more fossil fuel than you would do by driving your car.",
        "No kidding?",
        "Well that's a conclusion, I have to say, some people have argued with.",
        "But the basic fact is true is that the food system, particularly in our country but increasingly so across the world, is utterly dependent upon huge inputs of fossil carbon in the form of fertilizer and in the form of processing energy.",

        "Any kind of cap on emissions, in effect, will begin to raise the price of fossil fuel relative to everything else.",
