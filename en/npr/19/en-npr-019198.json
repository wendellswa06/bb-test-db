        "Insulate your house properly.",
        "In the U.K.",
        "obviously it's different.",
        "We have a pretty temperate climate.",
        "It no longer gets cold at all during the winter, but still people spend a lot of money and a lot of carbon dioxide on the gas, the natural gas they use to heat their home.",
        "So we actually did - we looked at four cases.",
        "One is actually a hypothetical scenario of a global deforestation, and then we also looked at regionally.",
        "Regionally, in the sense, we really again performed a larger scale experiment -tropics and temperate regions and boreal regions.",
        "That's the most important thing, an efficient boiler, a properly insulated house, proper roof insulation, and turn the thermostat down.",
        "There is apparently an accruable tendency around the developed world for people to run their houses in winter at higher and higher temperatures.",
        "That's driving up gas used around the world and it's contributing to climate change."

        "Now, the other thing we need to talk about is personal travel, if I may say so.",
        "Yes, please.",
        "It's a very, very contentious subject, but flying is causing more damage to the global atmosphere every year.",
        "And in other things like home heating we can see simple steps that will slow the rise and eventually turn it down.",
        "But in the case of flying around the world, we're seeing very rapid increases year on year.",
        "In Europe, it's rising at about five percent per annum, emissions from flying.",
        "I don't know about the United States, but in the other parts of the world like China it's rising even faster.",
        "And flying does a lot more damage to the atmosphere than just CO2, it's much more virulent.",
        "And if we're going to get hold of global warming, we're really going to have to do something about flying.",
        "We simply can't get down to an 80 percent reduction by 2050 if we continue to expand our airline travel.",
        "So it's individual personal travel you're talking about?",
        "Of which flying is the most important in Europe.",
        "Yeah, yeah...",
        "But it's a very good point.",
        "One of the things to be said is that it doesn't need that - all these things we're talking about don't need to mean some kind of life of privation.",
        "In the book that I wrote this year, a book called \"\"Deep Economy,\"\" one of the points that it makes is the sort of level of new economic research that we have to show that the increased consumption that Americans have engaged in, and people around the world, for the last 50 years haven't actually made us any happier.",
        "In fact, it's tended to make us more disconnected from each other as we've sprawled ever further out to the suburbs, as Donna was saying, or taking endlessly more trips around the world, as Chris points out.",

        "How many - tell us a little bit about your studies.",
        "Where did you study the trees?",
        "Now why do trees work to suck up CO2, you know, in one place but not in another?",
        "Well, in a way, it's not sucking up.",
        "I mean, you know, all the trees, in fact, take up the CO2.",
        "But in addition to that, you know, we call that as a carbon sink effect.",
        "In addition to that, they also have, you know, they modify their surface.",
        "For example, you know, the tropical forest, they really help taking out water from the soil and they release to that moisture, which helps to form clouds, which reflects sunlight.",
        "So basically you receive less sunlight at the surface, which cools the planet.",
        "And in the high latitudes, it's the opposite.",
        "What happens is, you know, if you have a snow that is very highly reflective, it reflects almost like 90 percent of the sunlight.",
        "But if you plant trees there, only like 10, you know, 10 percent of the sunlight is reflected.",
        "So you tend to absorb more sunlight in snow-covered regions if you plant trees.",
        "Very interesting.",
        "So the effects were actually not taken into account in all these, you know, reforestation and deforestation strategies.",
        "Now your paper has been picked up by global warming skeptics who say it's a proof that we don't need to slow deforestation taking place around the world.",
        "No.",

        "And what our, you know, the message I want people to take is, our study provides scientific guidance to, you know, where the climate benefits of trees will be maximized."
