        "As we hear from NPR's Rob Stein, it's been found to save infected monkeys.",
        "Even though doctors have given ZMapp to a handful of victims of the current outbreak, the drug had never been tested in people or even in monkeys.",

        "The researchers infected 18 monkeys with the Ebola virus and injected the animals with ZMapp to see if the drug would save them.",
        "Every single monkey - a 100 percent - survived.",
        "And that's even though some of the animals didn't get the drug until five days after they were infected and were already sick.",
        "What's quite remarkable is that we could rescue some of the animals that had advanced disease.",
        "And what's advanced disease is the animal that is just a few days from the end - just a few hours.",
        "Now the question is whether ZMapp would work as well in people.",
        "The short answer?",
        "No one knows.",
        "But Kobinger and others say, this at least suggests it might.",
        "I think it strongly supports that concept.",
        "Two American missionaries who got ZMapp survived.",
        "But at least two other people who got ZMapp - a Spanish priest and a Liberian doctor - ended up dying anyway.",
        "So Thomas Geisbert of the University of Texas says, it's hard to know what to think from those cases.",
        "I don't know that we can really draw any conclusions from that one way or the other.",
        "That's why Geisbert says, the new study is so important."
