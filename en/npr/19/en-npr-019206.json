        "Our constant drumbeat, since we got to that part of Iraq, was if the security situation improves, then we can start delivering the goods and services, if you will, that you and your people all want so badly.",

        "Brig.",
        "Gen.",
        "KELLY: Much of my mission will be training Iraqi young men into their army and into their police forces.",
        "We have a very, very robust training program for both their army and for the police forces that are in the cities.",
        "We engage constantly with the local sheiks and the provincial government.",
        "And so the engagement is from absolutely the grassroots level all the way up to the governor in Ramadi.",
        "And then we - I'll have people - they have people there now who then kind of help the Ramadi provincial government bridge the gap to Baghdad.",
        "Bridging that gap and getting the Shiite government to take in the Sunni forces or Sunni young men who want to be in the military has been difficult.",

        "Now, you got to remember, the overwhelming number of people that live in the province are Sunni, and your recruit base is all Sunni.",
        "But there are increasing numbers, and this is certainly what the Marines are doing out there right now, trying to increase the numbers of Shia into those units, and the government in Baghdad that may have been somewhat hesitant about, you know, a couple of Sunni divisions, they seem to have overcome that because the logistical supply coming out of Baghdad to those divisions, as I understand it, is approaching normal levels - vehicles, things like that.",
        "But I think probably the biggest indicator is the central government deciding to deploy brigades out of the Al-Anbar province for temporary periods of time to hotspots to fight along side predominantly Shia units.",
        "And of course those decisions are not made by U.S.",
        "commanders.",
        "These are made by, you know, the central government in Iraq, and that's a huge indicator, I would think, of how the trust is beginning to build.",
        "There is expected to be drawdown of U.S.",
        "troops in this coming year, following what might be the end of the surge.",
        "How does that fit into your mission there in Al Anbar?",
        "Brig.",
        "Gen.",
        "KELLY: You know, one of the constant drumbeats, again, I think from certainly the policymakers in Washington have been that as Iraqi police and army forces, if they are taking more and more of the battle space over, will make some decisions down the line.",
        "And certainly I won't make those decisions.",
        "I'll probably make some recommendations.",
        "But I think General Petraeus is due to make some recommendations in March or April about force levels, and you know, obviously, we'll salute whatever we're told to do.",
