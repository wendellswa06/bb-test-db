        "What do these murders tell us about the stability of Russia today?",
        "It's a growing insecurity and it's felt not only by ordinary citizens but also by the governing elite, because with 2008 looming, they are all (unintelligible) to great uncertainty.",

        "Yeah.",

        "But it might be change of government in Russia, but I wouldn't call it an election, because election process in Russia was questionable under Yeltsin, but with Putin is just a farce."

        "What do you think his next move will be?",
        "I think it's a 50/50 call, because we can't get into Putin's decision-making process, but I would probably bet now for him trying to find one way or another to stay in.",

        "Yes, but it's the - you can't get proper registration in Russia unless you are engaged in one way or another in negotiation with Kremlin, and our goal from the very beginning, and still is now, was to unite different political forces based on a very broad coalition program.",
        "To a certain extent, it can be compared to situation in Chile in 1988, '89 when Pinochet announced the referendum and all the political groups from Communists to Christian Democrats, they united with just one goal, to beat Pinochet and to stop this dictatorship.",
        "We have similar goal now in Russia.",
        "But if I could just interject, you mentioned Chile a moment ago.",
        "The opposition to Pinochet became very united.",
        "In Russia, the problem seems to be that the opposition is very divided.",
        "It was the case.",
        "It is changing now because in the last four to five months I think the actions of Kremlin and Kremlin-controlled Parliament are forcing even those who sincerely hope that they could negotiate a deal with Kremlin, now they're all kicked out of this so-called mainstream political field into the radical opposition.",
        "I will predict that within the next four, five, six months, the very powerful radical opposition group in Russia will be formed because there is no other choice for people who want to change the suicidal course of our country.",
        "Will you be a part of that?",
        "Will you consider running for office?",
        "I'm trying to play an important part of that because my country is in great danger, and as a person who has been defending the colors of my country for 25 years, I believe I have to be in the midst of this fight as well."
