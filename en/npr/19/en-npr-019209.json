        "He seems like, truly, a humble man.",
        "He - yes, he is.",
        "And he really, really is.",
        "He - one of the reasons why he didn't get any fame was that he, you know, he performed with his back to the audience in the early '70s.",
        "The few times he had to do the showcase performances to studio executives of those record companies, he performed with his back to the audience.",
        "And they were like, who is this guy?",
        "I mean, we're not going to promote someone who doesn't want to be a star himself.",
        "And when I interviewed him 40 years later, he was actually the same.",
        "He actually started to turn around from the camera, facing the wall.",
        "He is the most private person that I ever met.",
        "Yet when he gets back on stage, he goes back to South Africa, he's rediscovered and has sold-out concerts.",
        "You've got fantastic footage of a concert - I guess the first one - in which the people just scream for 10 minutes before they will allow him to even sing.",
        "And it is an amazing moment when he seems to go to that stage and act as if he's done that his whole life.",
        "He's totally natural.",
        "Right.",
        "So 28 years after he recorded his album, he gets a phone call from a fan in South Africa, telling him that you are bigger than The Rolling Stones.",
        "And he says, you got - sorry, you got the wrong guy.",
        "I'm Rodriguez the construction worker.",
        "I don't know who you're talking about.",
        "And then they said: Did you make an album called \"\"Cold Fact\"\"?",
        "Yeah, I did, 20 years - 28 years ago.",
        "In South Africa, that album is more famous than \"\"Abbey Road.\"\" And he doesn't believe them.",
        "They convinced him.",
        "You have to come to South Africa.",
        "You will not be disappointed.",
        "And he is convinced.",
        "He goes there, and he doesn't know what to expect.",
        "And the flight opens its doors, it's, you know, on the tarmac, there's a red carpet, security guards, paparazzi, limousines.",
        "He cannot walk around the limousine.",
        "He thinks it's for some president or something.",
        "So the security guards comes and they grab him, and they pull him inside the car.",
        "On the highway, he looks out at the window, every lamp post in the whole city, big posters: Rodriguez, Rodriguez, Rodriguez Live, Rodriguez Live.",
        "He's - you know, he enters that stage.",
        "He can't sing, as you say, for 10 minutes because, for them, it's like seeing Elvis Presley coming back from the dead.",
        "He's a resurrected man.",
        "And then he starts to sing.",
        "And he doesn't remember the lyrics because he hasn't sang these songs for 30 years.",
        "But it doesn't matter, because 5,000 people know every single word.",
        "They sing the songs for him.",
        "And he just stands there.",
        "You know, it's a religious - you know, for everyone there, it was a religious experience.",
        "It was something unbelievable.",
        "And so this has an amazing ending.",
        "He's gone back and toured several times in South Africa.",
        "And there's a moment - a bit of text at the end of your film that says he gives the money that he earns from those concerts - most of it, anyway - away to friends and family.",
        "He's the most different man I've ever met.",
        "He doesn't consume.",
        "He never consumed.",
        "He never had anything.",
        "So he never started to consume.",
        "And, of course, you do a lot of sacrifices.",
        "He can't go on nice holidays to Mexico and buy some nice cars, but you get something in return: real freedom.",
        "You know, everyone says, I have to work so I can buy my freedom.",
        "But the truth is, freedom is free.",
        "We all have to do stuff, you and I.",
        "We have to work and earn money because we have a flat to, you know, we have a lifestyle that we need to support."

        "I mean, strange that not South African documentary filmmaker would have done this story before.",
        "And it is fascinating - particularly the early part of the film - for what it tells us about how isolated a place South Africa was.",
        "There's an extraordinary moment where they - you show one of Rodriguez's records, and cuts have been censored by the broadcasters.",
        "Of course, there is only state broadcasting in those days, in South Africa.",
        "It's been censored by scratching - literally, physically scratching - that particular cut on the record so it could not be played on the radio.",
        "Right, right.",
        "And the strange thing was that you could buy the album, because you couldn't hear it on the radio.",

        "I don't think he was, because at the concert, for example, you only see white people.",
        "And I thought this is, yeah, of course, because there was still apartheid, and it was really, really divided.",
        "The white society was very, very different from the black society.",
