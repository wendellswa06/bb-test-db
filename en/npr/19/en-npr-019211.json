        "This year, we're probably looking at another three-and-a-half, 4 or 5 percent, maybe, and the same next year.",
        "So I don't know about you, Neal, but my raises haven't been keeping quite pace with 10 percent jumps.",
        "So for people who are on either fixed incomes or not getting huge raises, that's a lot.",
        "And, of course, during the drought last summer, you mentioned, most prominently in Texas, a lot of people sold off their herds because, well, they obviously had a problem feeding and watering them.",
        "And so fewer cows in the country means there's less beef, and it costs more.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "Inventories are quite low.",
        "That's a real problem, because actually, we've had several years in a row now where there have been pressures towards reducing the size of the livestock herds.",
        "You don't want to have to pay for feeding them in all of these droughts.",
        "Energy's expensive.",
        "So as soon as an animal gets to the point where they call it market-ready, they want to slaughter it so that they can take what profits they can and move on.",
        "But that means that the inventory of meat coming up will be very reduced.",
        "And at the same time, of course, around the world, lots of people want to buy our food products.",
        "So that causes a lot of our food to be exported, and it drives up the prices.",
        "We're talking with Marilyn Geewax, NPR senior business editor, about the report today outlining the prospect for food prices in the year to come.",
        "And, well, we're talking about the food industry in general, which is undergoing changes.",
        "Well, part of that is due to the weather, and part of that is due to the climate, which looks more hot and more dry as we look ahead.",
        "We want to hear from those of you in the food business, whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a wholesaler or a retailer.",

        "Thanks.",
        "Marilyn?",
        "You know, that's one of the things that we'll have to see as consumers, is how much are merchants - restaurant owners and grocery store managers - how much are they going to pass along to us?",
        "Because, you know, as I said, wages are really not going up.",
        "We still have 8.2 percent unemployment.",
        "So a lot of people can't afford a lot more for groceries.",
        "How much of that do you just cut your profits, and how much can you afford to pass along to people?",
        "Another response from consumers, the USDA economist told me today that we are seeing people shifting away from meat and more towards chicken, which is a little cheaper, and other just going a little more vegetarian or smaller portions.",
        "So just because wholesale prices rise, it doesn't necessarily mean that retail prices will track as much, because we may change our behaviors, and merchants may just eat the losses.",
        "One of the questions I had about you - we were talking about the U.S.",
        "corn crop, and it's down or projected to be down this summer.",
        "What - a significant percentage of that goes into ethanol, which is added into gasoline.",
        "What's happening with that?",
        "Obviously, that affects the price of fuel, as well.",
        "Well, whenever oil prices rise, the demand for ethanol grows, as well, because it becomes a relatively cheaper option.",
        "And an awful lot of our corn does go into ethanol, and many people who are, shall we say, food activists - people who believe that corn should only be used for eating - are really being more energized by this issue.",
        "They're seeing these corn prices rise, and they say: Why are we using something as precious as food to fuel, you know, motorcycles or whatever?",
        "So that's an ongoing political debate about how much should we put into ethanol.",
        "Other people think that farmers will respond.",
        "We'll just get more corn in the future.",
        "We're just having a tough year.",
        "We shouldn't change energy policy based on one year's drought.",
        "But if the corn prices are spiking, aren't ethanol producers facing their own problems?",
        "The thing is they've really been - they've done about all they can do for this year.",
        "They've made a lot of ethanol, and at this point we're really, the corn is moving into food."

        "My pleasure, Neal.",
        "And as we look towards the effects in other countries, we pointed out what happened in 1988, I think people remember that very well.",
        "One of the things that happens when you have a shortage of one of the big three grains - wheat, rice, corn - is that when the prices first go up, the prices for the other grains tend to follow because there's a certain amount of substitution possible in the world grain market, the world food economy.",
        "And one of the interesting things about this is that it's not wheat or rice, which are food staples, but corn, which is our feed grain.",
        "And so what we're going to be seeing probably for the first time in history is substantial numbers of people moving down the food chain because the prices of livestock products are going up faster than their incomes."

        "But it takes a lot of corn and soybeans in order to move people up the food chain.",
        "And right now, I mean, we're focusing on corn, but soybeans are in trouble, too.",

        "That's the real food security indicator.",

        "We had 100, 110 days of carryover up until not too many years ago, and it's now dropped down to 80, down toward 70, and that's when it gets a little dicey because you don't have much to fall back on.",
