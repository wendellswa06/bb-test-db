        "Hi, how are you, Neal?",
        "I like your show.",
        "Thank you.",
        "So I am part owner of a small local food distributing company here called Eat Local, Eat Natural.",
        "We source from local farms.",
        "And we like them to be what we call sustainable farms or clean farms, and we deliver to, oh, I don't know, 80, 90 chefs around the Detroit, Ann Arbor area, as well as retail stores like Whole Foods and so on.",
        "So...",
        "And what are you seeing in terms of prices?",
        "OK, right.",
        "So it - you know, well, we're seeing an increase, and particularly our poultry suppliers are beginning to inform us of increases coming, and in particular eggs are - you know, eggs are the first to hit because it doesn't take long for a hen to produce eggs out of the grain it eats, that corn and soybean meal that it eats.",
        "So that affects the egg growers really fast.",
        "And so we've just recently increased the price of our eggs because of increasing prices from the farms that we pick up from.",
        "And the poultry, the chicken suppliers, chicken meat suppliers, are hitting us right now, too.",
        "The - we haven't been hit by the beef suppliers yet nor the pork suppliers nor any of the other meats that we sell.",
        "But, you know, the eggs come right up.",
        "Marilyn Geewax, I wanted to ask you about this.",
        "Eggs, of course, are one of those staples by which we, well, sort of measure our diet.",
        "Yes, it's interesting because while lots of things change, a dozen eggs, if you sat down and looked at them 100 years ago, they were pretty much - looked like eggs, and now they pretty much look like eggs.",
        "So we can actually compare those things.",
        "In 1900, to buy a dozen eggs, it took a little bit more than an hour's worth of work for the average person.",
        "You were making about 21 cents an hour, and a dozen eggs cost about 23 cents.",
        "So that was a lot of work to serve your family a dozen eggs.",
        "So just to understand how much the prices have actually fallen over time, the typical wage now is about $23 an hour, and eggs are, you know, $1.69, maybe $2 depending on what you're buying.",
        "So it takes a fraction of your hour.",
        "You can make enough money to buy a dozen eggs in a matter of minutes these days.",
        "So it's important for us to remember that."

        "Tim, you were saying, I'm sorry?",
        "Well, I said and that's because both of large, mechanized farm systems, right, plus the cheap cost of grain, which is due in part to the huge subsidies that are paid out by the government.",
        "And I wonder, as we turn back to you, Lester Brown, are those things that we can depend on in the future?",
        "By those things, you mean...",
        "The efficiency of industrialized farms and U.S.",
        "subsidies to agriculture?",
        "Good question.",
        "Well, the subsidies are under a lot of pressure now as part of the overall budget-cutting sort of thing.",
        "But so far they've been hanging on surprisingly well.",
        "But the efficiency of agriculture, Marilyn was mentioning it used to take hour, you know, of work to buy a dozen eggs, and now it's probably five minutes or something like that.",
        "One of the reasons that we have the diversity in our diet at a relatively low cost is because of the efficiency, and these are larger operations, there's no question about it.",
        "They are highly efficient.",
        "And we have, as a result, the cheapest food of any society in history.",
        "We spend only about 10 percent of our income on food.",
        "That's historically unheard of.",
        "Tim, good luck, thanks very much for the phone call.",

        "I did want to ask you, though, as we - if we see what's happening this summer, Lester Brown, if this is going to be a drought that is persistent, obviously some years better than others but a persistent drought over an extended period of time, that is going to change things, no?",
        "Well, it's a major concern because we don't have the stocks and because we're facing a lot of other issues at the same time that we're facing this drought, which is probably, partly at least, the result of climate change.",
        "We're facing water shortages on a scale we've never seen before.",
        "Our major agriculture states, Texas and California, the irrigated area is shrinking.",
        "More and more water is going to cities, aquifers are being depleted, and this story is being repeated in many countries around the world.",
        "So water is emerging as a major constraint on food production.",
        "We have enough land, there's a lot of land that'll produce if we had the water to go with it.",
        "So water's becoming a major issue, along with climate change.",
        "And I just wanted to ask Marilyn a point about that.",
        "The - there's a part of this country that's often referred to as the rust belt.",
        "It's the places that were first industrialized in this country.",
        "But those cities, if you think of Youngstown, Ohio, or Cleveland or Chicago or some of the places in New York, mill towns in Massachusetts, all those places are there because there's water there.",
        "Well, that's how you get rust, isn't it, from moisture?",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Lots of those places that - you know, in the '90s, I grew up in Ohio, a lot of the exurbs of Cleveland spread out.",
        "Cornfields that I knew as a child became suburbs.",
        "I have to wonder if in the future, a lot of those suburbs are going to turn back into cornfields because you do have the Great Lakes up there.",
        "If you had to, you could irrigate.",
        "There's more water in those areas.",
        "It seems to me that a lot of the upper Midwest could be put back into farm production.",
        "Land that I knew as farmer's land is not anymore.",
        "So I think that's one of the things that may be interesting going forward is what land comes back into food production.",
        "Let's get another caller in on the conversation.",

        "...And strategy and you have to think way before - ahead before you start to make your plan.",
        "So they got started on the second splint.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Your screener wanted me to mention that the farmers here - I've farmed all my life, stalk and corn, soy beans and so on.",
        "I've been through a number of drought cycles.",
        "And the farmers that had managed to fertilize and plant in such a way that held the maturing of their corn off - we just have gotten some drenching rains and the corn crop that had no tassel will make it.",
        "We will have a good crop because even though we got no rain, the worst drought - probably of the four I've been through, this was the worst one and I lived through, from my early age on, some bad ones.",
        "This was the worst one, and it will now make it.",
        "The leaves have opened back up and the tassels will come, and it looks fantastic.",
        "Forgive me, all I know about corn is from the plate to the mouth.",
        "When you're speaking about no tassels, explain a little bit.",
        "Well, corn will mature - it will begin to mature.",
        "And once that tassel comes, because it's such a powerful thing to get the, essentially, the sex organ down to pollinate, you get no kernel on the cob.",
        "And it's such a short little (unintelligible) thing that there's nothing there when it's dry.",
        "If that does not occur and you get rain, it'll go ahead and grow on out and mature.",
        "And then you get the tassel, you get a good crop.",
        "But if that tassel comes before you get moisture, you get nothing in the cob.",
        "And that was happening - see, that's the dreaded fear of a drought, the corn will mature too early.",
        "And I have read a little bit about farming, and it strikes me that farmers are a lot like gamblers.",
        "You're just waiting - you're hoping that the rain arrives at the right moment.",
        "Right.",
        "A skillful farmer knows how to plant and fertilize in a dry year to hold the maturing off.",
        "And you learn from your grandparents and parents how to plant and fertilize to make the maturation process later, which those of us that were smart listened to our grandparents and we did that this year.",
        "And they knew how to do that, and so...",
        "Well, congratulations on the rain, Randy.",
        "Now I have one more topic as far as water.",
        "Foreign countries have learned to drip irrigate.",
        "That's not done in this country.",
        "We're going to have to learn how to do that because spray irrigation tends not to work as well in these dry times, and drip irrigation is a technology we're going to have to start to learn how to do.",
        "It's more labor intensive, but it uses small amounts of water more regularly.",
        "And it conserves the water.",
        "That's probably our future.",
        "That's my comment.",
        "All right, Randy.",
        "Thanks very much and, again, congratulations on the rain.",
        "I'm sure it was a blessed event."

        "Suddenly there wasn't much new land to bring under the plow.",
        "We really concentrated on raising land productivity.",
        "As a result, the grain yield last year per acre was three times that in 1950.",
        "We now have to think about raising water productivity in a very systematic way.",
        "Drip irrigation worked very well for high-value crops, and we do, in fact, have quite a few acres, probably a few million acres in drip irrigation in the southwestern United States now but it's high-value crops.",

        "I can't pay $10 a pound for a cheese or whatever and...",

        "But what a lot of my customers have actually been doing is they've been buying smaller amounts more frequently rather than doing your one shopping trip every Sunday.",
        "They tend to come back to the store a couple of days a week every, you know, a quarter of a pound of turkey on Monday and then back on Wednesday again for extra if they need it.",
        "And I guess if they're driving by anyway, that doesn't add to their fuel costs very much."
