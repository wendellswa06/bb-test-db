        "The shooting death of Harambe, the 17-year-old Western lowland gorilla, after a four-year-old boy fell into his cage at Cincinnati Zoo, is a tragedy in all ways.",
        "Harambe delighted zoo-goers and may have meant the boy no harm.",
        "The little boy's parents say they're grateful their son survived and is doing well, but many people on social media platforms have attacked the mother as neglectful.",
        "Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society, said on his blog that the debate over how Harambe died reminds him of old dorm room discussions where people would pose imaginary questions that weighed the life of an animal against a human being's.",
        "But if some of the people who snarl at the boy's parents on social media want to do something more for animals, they may need to look no further than their own dinner.",
        "We've heard a lot in recent years about the 8.5 billion chickens that are slaughtered for food in the United States every year.",
        "The ones that live on factory farms are kept in cages about as large as a sheet of copy paper.",
        "Their feet never touch the ground.",
        "They never see the sun or sky.",
        "They never play or mate.",
        "Their beaks are often snipped or burned off to keep them from pecking each other to death in those cramped, congested cages.",
        "Harambe's death might also remind us how more than a hundred million pigs are raised for food in the United States.",
        "The ASPCA points out that pigs, who are known to be as intelligent as dogs, are one of the few animals that Americans both keep as pets and raise for food.",
        "Most pigs are kept in windowless sheds on factory farms in cages so small they cannot turn around, so they will grow fat.",
        "They live in their own manure, and the air is so heavy with ammonia that many pigs develop lesions on their lungs.",
        "We could go on, but it is not necessary to become a vegetarian to change what we need to consume fewer animals, which is probably healthier anyway.",
        "What happened to Harambe was a catastrophe, but one so rare as to be almost unprecedented.",
        "The treatment of so many millions of animals raised for food can be just business as usual.",
        "There's a bit of landscape work going on at the White House this summer.",
        "Since September, three intruders have been able to climb over the White House fence.",
        "Angled spikes will be added to try to deter fence-climbers.",
        "But those are temporary features.",
        "The Secret Service and the National Park Service are looking for more long-range design ideas to try to make the fence harder to climb but still make the White House look like the residence of a freely-elected leader in an open democracy.",
        "We're joined now in our studios by Alexandra Lange.",
        "She's architecture critic for Curbed and an opinion columnist at Dezeen.",

        "Thanks for having me.",
        "So what will the White House look like with what the Secret Service calls these removable anti-climb features?",
        "Well, the spikes that they're adding, the idea is that they will make it harder for people to get a grip on the top of the fence and also more likely to be snagged as they go over.",
        "But they won't make too big of a visual impact, I think, when you're standing in front of the fence and looking at it.",
        "I - I have talked to Secret Service agents - and not specifically about the spikes, but about the general proposition - who say they want to visibly deter people because they think discouraging people from even trying to climb over the fence is a better idea than having to pluck them off the fence.",
        "Yes, that makes sense.",
        "That said, there are other things that you can add to create more layers of defense beyond the fence itself.",
        "And they might be potentially more invisible - or even more attractive than the little spikes that they're adding to the fence.",
        "Such as?",
        "When one of the first fence-jumpers went over it, a lot of people jokingly suggested a moat for the White House, which, obviously, we're not going to have.",
        "But there is an 18th-century landscape feature called a ha-ha, which is a ditch in the ground with a wall built at the back of it, below eye level.",
        "And these were used on French and British country estates to keep livestock off the lawn surrounding the house.",
        "And the White House, in fact, originally had a ha-ha, during Jefferson's day, to keep the livestock that then wandered around Washington, D.C.",
        "away from the White House.",
        "So something like that would be very low-key, but would indeed slow people down if they approached the White House.",
        "Any other examples of security features that work at other notable buildings or buildings we may not know much about?",
        "Well, another good example is on Wall Street.",
        "Around the New York Stock Exchange, after 9/11, they put in these very attractively-designed bollards.",
        "Bollards are those little stakes or round balls or spikes that you often see outside the entrance of buildings.",
        "Yeah."

        "And I'm a recovering racist transformed by the great fruits of the Civil Rights movement in this city.",
        "They're usually concrete or metal and very plain.",
        "And they're to keep trucks from driving into the entrance of a building.",
        "But these bollards were designed like huge sort of faceted bronze gems, and they were of a mass that could stop a truck, but of a height that you could also sit on.",
        "And they ended up looking like really pretty sculptures in the middle of the street.",
        "So there are a lot of things that design can do to make these necessary features more attractive and not, you know, an interruption to the eye, like those bike rack, metal temporary barriers are.",
        "Are there museums, even entertainment venues, around the world that maybe we ought to look at for clues?",
        "One thing I think - when you're talking about public buildings that may not be able to be as accessible to the public as they used to be, I think it is interesting to think about them as a form of entertainment.",
        "And so what could you make for people to visit on the outside of the building that would satisfy them?",

        "And they have a Darth Vader costume in the lobby.",
        "So, I mean, it sounds sort of ridiculous, but if you think about people visiting the White House, it is, in some sense, a similar homage.",

        "As the school year comes to a close, lots of parents search out summer camps to keep their kids' minds active during the long break from school.",

        "I see it as an opportunity to have learning opportunities that are more well rounded, if you will.",

        "So you have a situation where there's potential to go outside and do things outdoors.",

        "What are they curious about?",
        "What are they reticent about as they think through the choices because what you want to do is you want your child to feel comfortable but you also want to nudge them a little bit in terms of growth.",
        "I would also suggest that parents pay attention to and inquire about the qualifications of the councilors who are offering the camping experience.",
        "There is a group that accredits camps, The American Camp Association.",
        "But if we're talking about young children - and NAEYC deals with the children from birth to eight - they might also go to our Web site rightchoiceforkids.org.",
        "That could tell them something about what to look for when you're talking about children in that kindergarten through third grade age range."
