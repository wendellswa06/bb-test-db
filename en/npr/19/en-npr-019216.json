        "He sort of banned the parliament, created all sorts of people's committees that were supposed to be this green revolution, he called it, where control was divested from the capital to all these little committees of loyalists who basically were what passed for a people's voice in his dictatorship.",
        "He at various times would call for pan-African unity and declare that Libya was now one with all of the other countries of Africa.",

        "But Loren Jenkins, just a few of the many rumors, completely unverifiable, that have been floating around, indeed all last night and this morning, rumors that Gadhafi had shown up in Caracas to flee the country, absolutely denied by the government of Venezuela.",
        "So far, as far as we know, he's still there.",
        "I mean, we've heard rumors, but we've seen denials.",
        "No one's seen him appear anywhere else.",
        "It's hard to know.",
        "But because there's no journalists there, there's no independent voices we're getting except for these Twitter tweets and YouTube pictures, images of confusion and war."
