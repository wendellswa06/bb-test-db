        "Mr.",
        "ST. JOHN: Well, that's a very good question and one I think a lot of us, including myself, who have studied Libya for over three decades, are still not completely sure.",
        "In the past the demonstrations that have occurred have been largely in the east, and that's where they started again this time.",
        "What seems to be different is that I think in light of what happened in Tunisia and most recently in Egypt, the regime is much more nervous about any kind of anti-regime activity, and as a result very quickly turned to the use of force.",
        "And it appears that when one or two people were killed, a crowd of 500 became a crowd of 5,000.",
        "When 20 or 30 were killed, a crowd of 5,000 became a crowd of 25,000.",
        "So I think the use of force has awakened a lot of discontent throughout the country, particularly in Libya - I'm sorry, particularly in the eastern part of the country, and as that dissent manifested itself, and the regime responded with force, other Libyans in and outside of Libya have increasingly said, you know, stop the killing.",
        "We've got to find a different way to address the problem.",
        "And tell us a little bit about Libya's armed forces, if you will.",
        "Who's in them?",
        "Who makes up the leaders of that armed force?",
        "And are they going to be willing to - well, if Saif, the colonel's son, vows of rivers of blood, are they going to be willing to be the spigots?",
        "Mr.",
        "ST. JOHN: I don't think so.",
        "I think one of the things we must understand about Libya, which is very different from Egypt, and Tunisia maybe to a lesser degree, in Egypt you had an independent force made up of conscripts, but largely a self-funding and self-directing military.",
        "In Libya you have a much smaller force.",
        "It tends to be officered by either tribesmen of Gadhafi or loyalists of Gadhafi.",
        "But even then, Gadhafi has, oddly enough, always been very suspicious of the military.",
        "He was a captain in the army when he came to power, and he enjoyed the support of the military to consolidate his role in Libya, but he has always been very suspicious of the armed forces as a place where dissent might occur.",
        "As a result, he's always been very careful to shift the leadership in the armed forces around the country and in some cases denied the military the modern weapons and so forth that other countries have been getting.",
        "At the same time, he's created a parallel force of loyalists called the 32nd Brigade, which is commanded by his youngest son, the seventh son, Khamis al-Gadhafi, and this is widely considered to be the best-trained, most effective, best-equipped force in Libya.",
        "And that's the force that was sent to Benghazi.",
        "For the first time, we've seen this sort of thing happen, where the leader, the Libyan leader, Gadhafi, where he felt the need to send his son and the 32nd Brigade on the front line.",
        "So I think that was a measure early on of the concern he had with the seriousness of the protests and perhaps also whether or not he felt he could really trust the standard armed forces to do his bidding."

        "Yes, I just wanted to comment on Colonel Gadhafi's regime and what's going on on the ground in Benghazi today and yesterday.",
        "Go ahead.",

        "He has nowhere to run.",
        "The reports of him going to Israel or going to Venezuela, the man has nowhere to run.",
        "He's wanted for heinous, heinous crimes with - he started a war with Chad and Uzu(ph), a needless war over pointless, pointless, pointless -just a war that he woke up one day and decided he was going to war.",
        "There's a common saying in Libya that he wakes up one day, and whatever he dreams will be the policy that he institutes.",
        "The man has devastated the infrastructure of Libya socially, economically.",
        "The schools, the infrastructure is crumbling.",
        "It's either nonexistent or crumbling from decay, and he's giving billions of dollars to these corrupt African regimes to fund, you know, loyalists within his own government so that, like your other commenter was saying, he doesn't trust the army, so he has these - almost these many different options (unintelligible) plays his cards(ph).",
        "He donates billions of dollars of the Libyan oil to foreign African national corrupt regimes, and in such he invokes this African unity as a way to suppress his own people."

        "He uses that against the European Union as well.",
        "He uses his oil.",
        "He uses his ability to either flood Europe with immigrants or to withhold them, and he uses the immigrants there.",
        "And for the past few days, he's used those same poor immigrants against his own people that are slaughtered in the streets of Benghazi.",
        "And, Sammy, what we hear is a litany of complaints about a ruler who's been in power for 42 years and has held virtually absolute authority and I - you know, Ronald Bruce St John, as you listen to the complaints, certainly you can hear the passion.",
        "Obviously, it's difficult to verify how much of any of that is true.",
        "Mr.",
        "ST. JOHN: Well, I would say this to Sammy: I think you've got it pretty well 100 percent correct.",
        "I think most of what you've said is true.",
        "The only additional comment I would make would be in reference to his policy towards Africa.",
        "Barack Obama draws large crowds at campaign events in Iowa and New Hampshire, but probably, not like this.",
        "Gadhafi has long felt Libya with five to six million people was not a playhouse, a stage big enough for him.",
        "He needed a bigger playhouse.",
        "And over the last 10 years, one of the things he's worked on very hard is trying to create a United States of Africa with a million-man army, a single currency and so forth, much like the African - or much like the European Union.",
        "But United States of Africa with himself as the head of state.",
        "And that's exactly what he's been working on.",
        "And that's why he's been doing some of the things Sammy was just referring to, in terms of spending a lot of the oil wealth of Libya on states in the Sahel and the Sahara and (unintelligible) African Africa, trying to get them to support his ambitions for the United States of Africa.",
        "Well, here's an email we have from Monica(ph).",
        "My husband and I travelled to Libya a few years ago to view a total solar eclipse.",

        "I remember a country that looked and seemed pretty well run.",
        "We didn't see any obvious signs of poverty where we went.",
        "One really interesting thing I remember is that Gadhafi had built an underground river that moved water from the desert south to the northern coast all in some huge underground pipe system.",
        "We thought that was a remarkable feat.",
        "I wonder if your guests and listeners know anything about that.",
        "Loren Jenkins, was this the Manmade River Project?",
        "The Manmade River Project, yeah, which is - was that.",
        "I mean, he did spend a lot of his money and a lot of the income on infrastructure.",
        "And he has tried to build up the coastal areas, which is where most of the population is."

        "I think one of the real differences between what's taking place today in Libya and what occurred in Egypt is in Egypt, the protesters were asking for a liberalization of the regime and wanted Mubarak out.",
        "But beyond that, they wanted to liberalize the existing regime.",
        "In Libya, the protesters are crying for Gadhafi to get out but also for an entire new regime to be created because there's no confidence in the abilities of this direct democracy system to function because it's been manipulated for so long by Gadhafi and his supporters.",
        "So I think you'll see, in immediate aftermath of a Gadhafi departure, I think you'll see the tribal leadership in Libya coming together, possibly through the People's Social Leadership committees and organization nationwide, an organization of Libyan leaders and mainly tribal leaders, it was formed after 1993.",
        "I think you'll see groups like that coming together and trying to decide what it is they want in the way of a new political system.",
        "But I would envision in the future a very different type system than the direct democracy system that Gadhafi has put in place over the last 41 years.",
