        "Officials there were quick to blame al-Qaida, but so far the group has made no official claim of responsibility.",
        "U.S.",
        "and Pakistani officials say Bhutto's murder may have been part of a larger offensive by a group backed by al-Qaida.",
        "NPR's Jackie Northam has been following the story, and she joins us.",
        "Jackie, first of all, what can you tell us about where the investigation is right now?",
        "Well, first of all, the official Pakistan government version of how Bhutto died has certainly changed.",
        "Initially, it came out that she died from gunshot wounds and maybe shrapnel wounds from a suicide bombing.",
        "But then on Friday, Pakistan's interior minister, Javed Cheema, came out and said, oh no, she suffered a fatal skull fracture when her head hit a lever on the sunroof of the armored SUV she was in.",
        "And people who were with Bhutto at that time of the attack and in the hospital when she died say that nonsense.",
        "You could clearly see gunshot wounds.",
        "And also one of the television stations in Pakistan on Saturday evening aired some amateur video footage and you can see Bhutto standing up to the sunroof and a man behind her holding a gun.",
        "So there are a lot of conflicting reports.",
        "But just the fact that the government came out and changed its story about how she died and so quickly blamed al-Qaida probably raises more questions than answers."

        "What was the basis for the government's claim that al-Qaida was behind the assassination?",
        "Well, because al-Qaida and al-Qaida-backed groups are based all along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan and have grown in numbers over the past year.",
        "The government there blames one man.",
        "His name is Baitullah Mehsud, and he's a leader of a group now called the Taliban Movement of Pakistan.",
        "This is a different group than the Taliban from Afghanistan.",

        "who closely follow this.",

        "This was something the Defense Secretary Robert Gates confirmed earlier this month.",
        "And you've already seen a series of attacks over the past six months believed to have been carried out by this group that have left hundreds of people dead in Pakistan and is believed Bhutto's death was part of that offensive.",

        "The Taliban had left the tribal area and moved into towns and cities in that area.",

        "But the military were able to push them back in most of the towns the Taliban had taken.",
