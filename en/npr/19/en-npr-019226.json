        "He was a three-time Tour de France winner.",

        "The Court of Arbitration for Sport announced yesterday that it was imposing a two-year ban on Contador, and stripping him of his 2010 Tour de France title.",
        "It was during that race that he tested positive for a banned substance called clenbuterol.",
        "It can burn fat and build muscle.",
        "And Contador claimed he ate meat that was tainted by that clenbuterol.",
        "The court said no.",
        "And he's the second Tour de France winner to lose the title because of a doping case; American Floyd Landis being the first.",
        "He lost the 2006 championship.",
        "So that's Contador.",
        "And then there's Lance Armstrong; a case against him has closed.",
        "Yes, it has.",
        "Armstrong kind of won this, in the sense that that nearly two- year investigation closed.",
        "It was looking into alleged doping and potential fraud, and other alleged federal crimes by Armstrong and former cycling teammates.",
        "The decision to close the case really came out of the blue.",
        "And it was announced with a brief statement by the U.S.",
        "attorney in Los Angeles, where a grand jury had been hearing witness testimony in the case.",
        "The Friday afternoon announcement - last Friday - came with no explanation why.",
        "And let's remember, of course, prosecutors will rarely, if ever, say this person is not guilty - he's totally innocent.",
        "They'll simply say, we have not found any evidence.",
        "So what has the reaction been to the closing of the case?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Sources who know about the case say within the agencies involved in the investigation - the FBI, the FDA, the U.S.",
        "Postal Service - there is surprise, even shock and anger, about the U.S.",
        "attorney's decision.",
        "Those agencies reportedly only got about a half-hour notice that the decision was going to be announced.",
        "And this was after there had been indications that prosecutors were preparing to indict Armstrong and others on federal crimes including mail fraud, drug distribution, wire fraud, witness tampering.",
        "Those indictments were said to be coming soon, maybe even next month."

        "Yeah, 24-year-old Kyle Stanley won his first PGA tour event, the Phoenix Open.",
