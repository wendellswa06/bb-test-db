        "In short, Jones says Paulk was following orders from the district attorney.",
        "When the indictment ran into trouble, the district attorney's office brought a second indictment, and then a third.",
        "All were thrown out.",
        "Ultimately, the hospital would drop its $66 million lawsuit against Rehberg and Bagnato.",
        "At the same time, it settled a countersuit out of court, paying the faxers an undisclosed and reportedly substantial sum.",
        "But Rehberg's other suit against the district attorney and investigator Paulk stayed alive, only to be tossed out by a federal appeals court in Atlanta.",
        "Today's case is an appeal of that decision, insofar as it applies to investigator Paulk.",
        "The Supreme Court has ruled that prosecutors are totally immune from damage suits for their trial-related actions, no matter how illegal those actions might have been.",
        "But investigative actions are not similarly protected, whether it's police or prosecutors doing the investigating.",
        "Thus, for instance, the court ruled 25 years ago that if police or prosecutors file false affidavits to obtain an arrest warrant, they can be sued for damages because such affidavits are part of the investigative process, not part of the trial.",
        "So one of the questions in this case is whether a grand jury proceeding is a trial or investigative proceeding.",
        "Lawyer Jones, representing investigator Paulk, contends that testimony in the grand jury is like testimony at trial.",
        "It's the same testimony.",
        "It's the same type of judicial proceeding, and the court has said you get absolute immunity.",
        "But Rehberg's lawyer, Andrew Pincus, counters that the purpose of a grand jury is to investigate.",
        "If you're the complaining witness, if you're the person who sets the prosecution in motion and allows it to proceed - which clearly Mr. Paulk was - then you shouldn't be absolutely immune.",
        "You should be able to be held responsible if what you say is false.",
        "Pincus notes that this lawsuit was brought under a post-Civil War statute enacted by Congress to provide citizens with a remedy for abuses of government power.",
        "And this incident fits just squarely in what Congress had in mind.",
        "This is an abuse of government power that caused someone to suffer not only financial injuries, but also a lot of personal hardship and personal angst for him and his family.",
        "And our position is that Mr. Paulk shouldn't get special, absolute immunity that protects him totally, no matter how false and how knowingly false his statements were.",
        "Paulk's lawyer concedes that this case does have the aura of a private prosecution.",
        "Oh, no question, no question."

        "There is a recourse.",

        "Investigator Paulk, he contends, didn't knowingly give false testimony.",
        "He just did what he was told to do by the DA.",
        "He's looking at it, like, hey, I did absolutely nothing wrong here, and yet I'm holding the bag.",
        "Perhaps, but Paulk remains the DA's chief investigator today, and if after trial he were held liable, it would be the county, though its insurer, that would pay damages.",
        "Those are a lot of ifs, though, and it's uncertain at best whether the Supreme Court will ever let there be a damages trial in this case.",
        "Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington.",
        "All in all, the court's two rulings were historic victories for gay rights advocates.",
        "But the justices stopped short of carving out a nationwide right to same-sex marriage.",

        "First, NPR's Carrie Johnson explains both decisions.",
        "Some of the new growth in social entrepreneurship may be coming from donors themselves.",
        "Many people with money to give away don't want to hand it over to foundations who then dole it out as they choose.",
        "In the first case, five justices, led by Anthony Kennedy, found part of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional.",
        "Justice Kennedy said Section Three of that federal law, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, deprives gay and lesbian couples of their rights to equal liberty.",
        "And in practical terms, it also deprives them of more than one thousand different kinds of federal benefits and programs.",
        "The decision applies most clearly to people who are legally married in one of 12 states and the District of Columbia - places that recognize same-sex marriages under their own laws.",
        "Edith Windsor, the plaintiff in the DOMA case, sued after she got stuck with a $360,000 estate tax bill when her wife, Thea, died.",
        "New York recognized their marriage but the federal government didn't.",
        "And Windsor wouldn't have had to pay all that money if she had married a man.",
        "If I had to survive Thea, what a glorious way to do it.",
        "And she would be so pleased.",
        "Thank you all.",
        "Soon after the decision, President Obama directed the Justice Department to review federal statutes and programs to make sure the DOMA ruling's implemented smoothly.",
        "The Supreme Court's second gay marriage decision had a more limited impact.",
        "A different five-justice majority, led this time by Chief John Roberts, decided not to get to the substance of California's same-sex marriage ban known as Proposition 8.",
        "Because the state's Democratic governor and attorney general refused to defend the ban, Roberts said there was no live controversy.",
        "The decision leaves in place a lower court ruling that threw out Proposition 8 as unconstitutional.",
        "Jennifer Kerns helped pass the ban almost five years ago."
