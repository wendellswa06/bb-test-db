        "The high cost of energy, he said, had made immediate action necessary.",
        "He attempted to put the project on a fast track that could have it in operation by September of next year perhaps, not coincidentally, just before he runs for re-election.",
        "But the project has become a lightning rod, attracting criticism from political opponents, Puerto Rican media, and in the U.S.",

        "Building public skepticism of the project, one of the first multimillion-dollar design contracts was awarded to a close Fortuno friend - a contractor with no pipeline experience.",

        "The governor of Puerto Rico simply decided that he would declare an energy emergency.",
        "And so since he controls the Senate and he controls the House - his party controls the Senate and the House - he controls every level of government in Puerto Rico.",
        "Fortuno also has linked his New Progressive Party closely with the Republican Party on the mainland, adopting tough policies on labor unions and government spending that have made him something of a rising star in the GOP.",
        "Gutierrez, a Democrat, has pressured officials with the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to closely scrutinize Fortuno's pipeline project, and his efforts appear to have borne fruit.",
        "Corps approval is necessary before construction can begin.",
        "And the Corps is now working with other federal agencies to conduct its own assessment of the pipeline's environmental impact."

        "You surveyed about 1,500 Americans last month, and nearly three-quarters - 72 percent - say they think legal same-sex marriage is inevitable.",
        "But obviously, more supporters of the idea think it's inevitable than opponents.",
        "That's right, but I think what's critical here is that if the majority on both sides of the issue now.",

        "They are more likely to say it should be discouraged by our society, not accepted, and they're more likely to oppose gay marriage.",
