        "The quiet merging of the two selves through the decades, happens in \"\"Laura Lamont's Life in Pictures,\"\" a high-buzz debut novel from writer Emma Straub.",
        "Straub says that her main character came to her while reading a New York Times obit on the life of the real-life actress Jennifer Jones.",
        "I was just struck by her life.",
        "And it just seemed like a novel.",
        "And I couldn't get it out of my mind, and so I copied it down, and I just kept going back to it.",
        "And when I decided that I did want to write this novel, I made sure to stay away - actually - from Jennifer Jones' biography, because I didn't want it to be, you know, a thinly veiled version of her.",
        "I really wanted my Laura Lamont to stand on her own feet.",
        "One of the things that Laura Lamont has to contend with - as a child, and then later on, throughout her life - is that her beautiful older sister, Hildy, the one who put on costumes and sashayed through the house; the one who liked boys; Laura - when she's still Elsa - discovers her, and something really terrible has happened.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Can you tell us what?",
        "After her first night on stage at her parents' theater, Elsa runs up the stairs, excited to tell her older sister about her triumph; and walks into her sister's bedroom, and discovers that her sister has committed suicide.",
        "And it's the event that really haunts her for the rest of her life, and it's also sort of the impetus for her to strike out for Hollywood - because her beautiful and talented older sister, who she thought was always destined for great things, you know, is no longer able.",
        "She really thinks that she has to do it.",
        "She has to live both lives, you know; her own and Hildy's.",
        "So tell us what happens to Elsa.",
        "So when Elsa Emerson is about 17 years old, she marries another actor who is at this theater that her father runs in Door County, Wisconsin.",
        "And they move to Los Angeles in the late 1930s, to become movie stars.",
        "And when they arrive, they have two children back-to-back - very quickly, And Elsa's acting career is sort of put on pause, and takes a backseat to her husband's."

        "And I started thinking about it, and I think that might be true for me, too; that the subject matter that's really at the heart of this book - and at the heart of many of my short stories, also - is this sort of idea of the self that we present and like, how is that different than the self we are inside?",
        "And it's, you know, Elsa Emerson becomes Laura Lamont, but of course, she's always Elsa as well.",
