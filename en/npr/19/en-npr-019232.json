        "- of Malvern, Pennsylvania.",
        "She writes: The swine flu shot will not be offered by my family doctor.",
        "How exactly will this work and where can I get my shot?",
        "So, how will it work?",
        "Well, it's being run by the government.",
        "The government has already purchased essentially all the vaccine being made.",
        "And the states goes to the CDC to order it and each state gets a percentage of what's available based on how many people live in that state.",
        "Then it goes from the distributor directly to school districts, clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, about 90,000 places across the United States.",
        "And last week, millions of vaccines went on their way to the distribution centers and to the states, and that includes both the regular injectable vaccine and a new nasal spray version that's based on one that's already used for seasonal flu.",
        "So that's the first part of her question, how will this work, and then her next part is where do I get my shot?"

        "Yes.",

        "We're working very hard to make sure that we can closely monitor for adverse events once the vaccine is distributed.",
        "For example, we're working with a number of managed care organizations to track any adverse events that occur in their populations very quickly and to decide whether it's something to be worried about or not.",
        "Are the side effects from the swine flu vaccine any different from the seasonal flu vaccine that many people get at the same time?",
        "So far the side effects are actually very similar.",
        "People will get a sore arm sometimes; some people might feel a little bit tired, have a little bit of headache.",
        "The kinds of side effects that one can expect to have in sometimes with various kinds of vaccines."

        "There seems to be a lot of worries out there.",
        "There was a poll the other day from the magazine Consumer Reports that found that two-thirds of parents are saying that they are either holding off on getting their kids vaccinated or they've decided not to have their kids vaccinated.",

        "The H1N1 pandemic flu vaccine is made exactly the same way with the same processing, with the same materials, as we make seasonal flu vaccine, which has an extraordinarily good safety record.",
        "He makes another point.",

        "I'm planning to get vaccinated, she writes, but she's concerned that results of vaccine studies in pregnant women aren't in yet and she wonders whether she should wait.",
        "I put Erin Bolton's question to Dr. Frank Witter.",
        "He's at Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore, and he's an expert in maternal fetal medicine.",
        "Erin, you should take the flu vaccine.",
        "Not only should you take the seasonal flu vaccine, but you should also take the pandemic flu vaccine.",
        "Pregnant women have gotten very, very sick from this new virus and have actually died.",
        "So you should take the vaccine.",
        "Strong warning there, Richard Knox, but this is something that a lot of women may be reluctant to do when they're pregnant."

        "A lot of his obstetrically colleagues worry that if they urge a woman to get vaccinated then she happens to miscarry, it may have nothing to do with the vaccine because we have no evidence that the flu vaccines do cause women to miscarry, but they may blame it on the doctor.",
        "well, you know, if that happens, I'd rather be blamed for a miscarriage than see a woman die from a flu that I might have helped her prevent.",

        "Yes.",
        "And by the way, people with asthma are a really big group.",
        "They're about - more than 20 million Americans have it.",
        "The reason Meghan is hesitating, I understand, is because she's wondering if she should get the first vaccine out of the bloc, which will be the nasal spray type.",
        "It's called FluMist.",
        "But people with asthma aren't supposed to get FluMist because it might touch off asthma attacks, so she's worried about getting swine flu while she's waiting for the regular vaccine to be available.",

        "In the younger individuals who are getting infected, there's a small percentage, but a disturbing percentage who go on to develop serious disease and even some deaths.",
        "About 30 percent of the deaths are in people who are otherwise young, vigorous and healthy.",
        "You rarely, rarely see that with seasonal influenza.",
        "You might ask the question the other way around really, wouldn't there be a lot of anger if the government had not developed this vaccine and a number of people, especially young healthy people had died?",
