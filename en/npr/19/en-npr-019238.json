        "But there's one difference between the old school, and it's not that old, like MP3 music and the Kindle and the iPhone apps or the other smart-phone apps, is that when I download music now, I can at least burn it to a CD or put it on a thumb drive, and I can keep it there, right?",
        "I can't do that with an app, or I can't do that with my Kindle.",

        "Music has always had these two forms in the digital age, the digital form that you bought in the form of a CD and had the right to rip and transfer to your MP3 player or going the other direction.",
        "You have been privileged by iTunes to transfer music you've purchased to a CD, although you lose a little in the quality, but music is that special case, where you've always had from the beginning of iTunes music store, have had an alternative way of getting your digital music onto your personal devices.",
        "Books are a different situation.",
        "There isn't a parallel way of getting a free version of, say, the paperbound version of a book onto your PC or into your iPhone.",
        "You only can obtain it through sanctioned - a sanctioned store like Amazon if it's under copyright.",
        "Public-domain books are freely available.",

        "Shouldn't I be able to do that?",
        "Well, one reason it's $9 instead of $25 is you aren't getting the same thing without the paper.",
        "You're getting the right to use it personally, which means you can't resell it.",
        "It has copy protection built in.",
        "And so, unlike the paperbound version, it can only be used on your machines, and it's a limited number.",
        "The same applies to the Audible version of books.",
        "If you go to audible.com, which is now owned by Amazon, you purchase the right to listen to those books on your devices, but you can't resell them.",
        "It's part of the deal, redefined ownership.",
        "Yeah.",

        "It has a very slow, opaque approval process that the app developers have to go through, and most maddening of all now, a number of these developers are finding that apps that they have already received approval to distribute, have distributed, are now being yanked from the store for reasons that Apple is not making clear, other than to say the features compete with those with the iPhone itself.",
        "A lot of the controversy right now centers around Google Voice, a service that Google offers that offers all sorts of features you can't get with your cell-phone service, and the Google Voice iPhone app has been pulled.",
        "Some third-party apps that use Google Voice have been pulled, and when you look at the tech blogs, there is a firestorm of criticism directed at Apple.",

        "It's a company that is not known for responding to complaints from anyone.",
        "This is a real crisis in the developer community, and it will be interesting to see if Apple acknowledges that it has a real problem on its hands.",
        "This came up in an interview that Steve Jobs did last year.",
        "There had been a rumored kill switch built into the iPhone, and he was asked about it.",
        "This would be a switch that Apple could throw that would delete or disable any given iPhone app, and he said yes, there is such a switch.",
        "He said it would be irresponsible for us to not have such a switch built in, in case there was a malicious app that got through our approval process and was doing bad things, stealing data or otherwise behaving in a way that it had never been approved to do.",

        "So it seems like there's kind of a gross power imbalance here between the corporations that produce these products and the individual consumer, and I wonder if there isn't some sort of more sensible way that doesn't force people to - more or less force people, to essentially lie or at least agree to things that they maybe really don't want to agree to.",
        "Good question.",
        "This has been a part of software since the beginning days, this explicit agreement that you have when you use it, too.",

        "So your product, Vanish, works between two parties.",
        "In other words, one party, who I'm sending my email to, has a copy, and I have a copy.",
