        "The system actually can work between multiple parties.",
        "We have a way of encrypting text such that for a while, anybody who receives that encrypted text can decode it and read it, but after some time limit, that text expires, and neither the sender nor the receiver nor anyone else who may find a copy of that data later will be able to decrypt it.",
        "How does that work?",
        "Well, it works in a kind of interesting way.",
        "One of the key properties we wanted is that we wanted the deletion to happen on its own, without any action taken by the part of the user, and we wanted it to happen without the user having to trust anyone to do this.",
        "There are services on which you can store data that will guarantee to delete it, but then you have to trust those services to do so and not give it away.",
        "So, the simplest way to describe this is that we leverage a kind of interesting structure in the world, now, which are peer-to-peer data sharing systems.",
        "These are global-scale distributed systems.",
        "The nodes that are part of that are individual computers owned by people who are sharing - excuse me - who are sharing data and sharing files.",
        "There may be millions of users connected at any particular time, and the system we leverage is called Vuze.",
        "And there are over a million computers connected over 200 companies.",
        "So what we do is we encrypt your data using a secret key that neither of the parties know.",
        "So we don't tell you the key, and therefore you can never be forced to reveal it.",
        "We take that key and we break it into a number of pieces, let's say 20 pieces.",
        "And we sprinkle those pieces over this global scale system.",
        "Now, a property of this system is that over time, nodes join the system and leave the system.",
        "And once the node leaves the system, any data that we've stored on that node is lost, even if it rejoins later.",
        "Another property is that the nodes on these systems purposely forget anything they've learned over the last eight hours on an eight-hour period.",
        "So eight hours from now, some - the nodes that have been on for eight hours will purge the last eight hours of information.",
        "The result of this is that over time, these pieces of the key that we scatter in the Internet will disappear.",
        "And once a number of them are gone, we'll never be able to put the puzzle back together again.",
        "Wow.",
        "That sounds pretty complete.",
        "And when will this be ready for primetime, do you think?",
        "Well, we put a prototype on the Internet.",
        "As I said, it's not a product, but people can download it and try it.",
        "We have a Web site, which is vanish.cs.washington.edu.",
        "I hope you have a big server there at this moment."

        "There are so many legal restrictions on deleting information in companies and in government organizations.",
        "So email is protected, but a phone call is not.",
        "And I wonder if this technology is used widely in government organizations, where we end up - this would be a downside - would we end up with less in the archived records of what goes on, say, in Washington.",

        "Well, the change in its policy that was just mentioned sparked a great controversy and drew a lot of criticism, and Facebook backed off, said it had been misunderstood, and then organized a kind of plebiscite in which members were invited to vote on a governance structure.",
        "And it seems to have learned its lesson that perpetual storage of member data is not acceptable.",
        "But there's this other story that's in the news today about the case of the school administration - I believe it's in Mississippi."
