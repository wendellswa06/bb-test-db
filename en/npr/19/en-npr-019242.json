        "Well, as before, these raids are expected to target migrant families who've recently arrived in the U.S., mostly from Central America, and who've already received their final orders of deportation.",
        "We think they'll be concentrated mainly in 10 cities - Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Houston among them.",
        "These are places where the Department of Justice has sped up immigration cases of many recent arrivals.",
        "We asked ICE for more details.",
        "They declined to comment on operations.",

        "We're going to hear from Houston's mayor in just a moment.",
        "But why would they announce that these raids are coming?",
        "Doesn't that kind of undermine the mission?",
        "Well, I put that question to former ICE Director John Sandweg.",
        "Here is what he had to say.",
        "It's confusing for me why you would ever advertise an operation like this in advance of actually conducting it.",
        "I mean, that violates the cardinal rule, which is that you maintain the element of surprise, both to protect the safety of your officers and to ensure the effectiveness of the operation.",
        "Sandweg thinks there is tension inside the Department of Homeland Security about that very question because, first, President Trump tweeted that these raids were coming and also that this current operation has been leaked to the public."

        "But Sandweg also thinks there are big concerns inside DHS about going after migrant families in the first place in this public way because, you know, Sandweg says if children are separated from their parents as a result of this - of these raids, it could really be a black eye for ICE and could potentially - that could potentially happen if these raids - if the parents are in the country illegally but the children are U.S.",
