        "You know, the military in some ways gets, like, a bad rap from people who are not in the military.",

        "The problem really is us at home.",

        "George, if you had a son, or I don't know if you do or don't, would you want him to go, or daughter for that matter?",
        "Yes.",
        "Most definitely.",

        "And is that how the military continues to restock itself through families that have passed down membership in the armed services from generation to generation.",
        "Well, actually, no. I've mostly found that - especially in the more recent conflicts, you know, Gulf War I and Iraq, that the vets, you know, are really not as keen on even going back themselves for the third time.",
        "And they wouldn't want their children to be involved in it.",
        "I think that they're sort of rethinking, you know, sort of the whole dynamic that got us into this situation to begin with.",
        "And with the older vets I interviewed, the World War II, Korea, you know, it's much more of a feeling of nostalgia and warmth about, you know, what they accomplished, you know.",
        "I really do believe that that generation made it possible for me to have the things that I have in my life.",
        "I think they're the ones who started the Civil Rights Movement.",
        "But, I mean - actually, no. It's like, I find that a lot of the vets, you know, they want - they're working hard so that their kids can have as much as, you know, can go to college and do big things.",
        "And so, I mean, I really admire the guests on the show and their experiences and it's actually very inspiring to hear to be honest.",
        "One of the themes of this conversation is whether or not the military is an economic stepping stone or a socioeconomic stepping stone.",
        "I'm going to ask all three of you as we bring the conversation to a close.",
        "First for you, George, has this been - is it an economic, a socioeconomic, stepping stone for African-Americans in the military?"
