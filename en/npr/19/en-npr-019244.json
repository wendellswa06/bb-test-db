        "Football is back and not a day too soon for fans of America's most popular sport.",
        "With the lockout over, teams have been busy, making moves, signing and trading players, including some big names like quarterback Donovan McNabb, receiver Chad Ochocinco, running back Reggie Bush, just to name three.",
        "More deals are coming as training camps kick off in preparation for the first preseason games.",
        "Under the new agreement, players will get greater workplace safety, better health care and fewer practices, while the owners, well, they walk away with more money.",

        "I'm doing great.",

        "So, I mean, this has - for a football fan, this has been one of the wildest weeks in memory.",
        "Yeah, football ping-pong.",
        "And it almost seems like when there is months-long able to negotiate and follow those negotiations, interesting things like this don't happen.",
        "For one, the number one free agent, Nnamdi Asomugha was - Asomugha, actually - was said to be going to Dallas, was said to be going to New York.",

        "They already got this great cornerback in Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie.",
        "All of a sudden, Philadelphia, within a span of three days, goes to being one of the premier defenses in the NFL just because of this really quick free agent period.",
        "And then you have - Philadelphia also got back-up quarterback Vince Young, who's backing up Michael Vick.",

        "One thing I did notice, Mike, before we take our first caller, is that the NFL seems to have, as you've already said, benefitted by getting its act together before the season started.",
        "And people are excited about this condensed free agency period, so much so, that I'm hearing and reading that the league is considering changing the way they normally do free agency to try to put this excitement in a bottle and keep it going every year.",

        "You know, it was held in a Manhattan hotel.",
        "No - three people from the media showed up, you know?",
        "And who cares where Archie Manning went or where Dan Pastorini went?",
        "He'd show up next year on your team, and you hope he did well.",

        "Now the draft is this signature off season event.",

        "We could turn that into a business.",
        "Sometimes too much is too much.",
        "It doesn't seem like that's even possible in the NFL.",
        "But my theory that a lot of people don't grasp is the reason that the NFL is so much more popular than other sports and, in fact, is this dominant and ascendant American cultural institution, is because of scarcity; because of the brutality of the game, the brutality that has caused 75 former players to sue the NFL because of concussions and post-concussion syndrome.",
        "It's such a brutal game.",
        "You can't play it more than once a week.",
        "And it's such a brutal game that you can't play it even for half the year.",
        "You know, they were debating going to 18 games.",
        "That didn't fly.",
        "But because of the scarcity, every game gets built up like a mini soap opera, and you can kill the golden goose if you give too much.",
        "And if these - the draft is something special, and free agency is cool.",
        "But if you try to turn everything into a television spectacle, at some point, you're going to turn people off.",

        "But it was presented that the players will not be making as much money as a percentage of overall revenue as you had been.",
        "So the players agreed to they'll be making about 47 percent of the money.",
        "In exchange for that, they got the end of two-a-day practices, which can be very brutal and draining.",
        "They got a lot more money in the pension fund.",
        "They got - the retired players will get better benefits.",
        "They got no padded practices on the same day twice.",
        "They got extra days off.",
        "They seem to take into account, like no other negotiation, the fact that brain injuries are serious, the fact that football's a really tough sport.",
        "They did not give in to an 18-game season.",
        "You know, I looked - I made an assessment on MORNING EDITION a day after it's settled.",
        "And I said, in a way, it's the most socially progressive contract I've seen.",
        "You know, they had to give up money.",

        "And I think it would be really interesting, some of the people who were against, maybe I have read that perhaps the losers were coaches.",
        "The losers - the coaches like all the extra practice.",
        "The coaches like putting their players in pads twice a day in the summer and getting them practice and quote, unquote, \"\"toughening them up.",
        "I wouldn't be too shocked if in 10 years, we look back and we say, you know what, the idea of two-a-day practices, maybe that wasn't such a good idea to begin with.",
        "Maybe that idea, the end of two-a-days, maybe that will trickle down to the college and high school and make things a little safer.",
        "We don't know.",
        "I mean, sometimes things just seem like common sense because they've never been tested, another way has never been tested.",
