        "Well, it was born in the middle of the Sargasso, which is the western part of this subtropical gyre, they call it.",
        "It's a clockwise spinning eddy in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean between ocean currents, and they're born there.",
        "They hatch as these little leaf-shaped larva, and they start drifting toward the coasts in the prevailing currents.",
        "And then at some point, they exit the Gulf Stream and start to spread their numbers, you know, potentially hundreds of millions of baby eels up the - via the freshwater rivers of the East Coast in North America.",

        "There's other types of eels, obviously, moray eels, conger eels, that spend their lives completely in the ocean, but this is really the only fish in the world that reproduces in the middle of an ocean and spends its adult life in freshwater."

        "I mean, what's the interest there?",
        "Well, the project that I started 11 years ago, this book, began, as I said, with an interest in the life history of the eel and this fascinating migration, but at some point after I had already had a contract to do the book and had proposed it, a friend of mine who'd spent - had lived in New Zealand for 15 years and was married to a Maori woman, a native Polynesian, and knew about the culture of the Polynesian people said, hey, mate, do you know about the sacred eels...",

        "Although, thinking back on it, I had heard rumors from trout fishermen fishing for introduced trout in New Zealand that occasionally they'd catch a four-, five-pound trout and this giant freshwater eel would come out from under a dark ledge and eat the fish because in New Zealand, their freshwater eels get very large.",
        "They have the largest freshwater eels in the world.",
        "They can grow up to seven, eight feet long and weigh over 80 pounds, and they can live 104 years.",

        "They - you know, the snake - that minimal-shaped creature is - plays an important role in world mythology from the Garden of Eden to all kinds of other stories as a monster, seducer and a guardian.",

        "And because there's - a lot of the Pacific islands are devoid of snakes, the eel was the closest available counterpart and plays that role, kind of, also as an erotic symbol in a lot of the mythology.",

        "Well, for centuries, they didn't know and there were all kinds of speculations about how eels reproduce.",
        "And before the 18th century, a lot of natural history was, sort of, fake natural history.",
        "And people like Isaac Walton who wrote \"\"The Compleat Angler\"\" in 1653 wrote things like eels generated from horsehairs that fell into puddles of dew certain at a certain time in May when the sun was hitting at a certain angle, you know?",
        "Or even Linnaeus, you know, the famous Swedish guy who created our modern system of taxonomy, thought that eels were viviparous or created live young.",

        "It wasn't until originally, you know, the as I mentioned before, the eel hatches into a little leaf-shaped larva.",
        "And that was originally that larvae, because it doesn't really look like an eel, was originally classified as a separate species of fish called Leptocephalus brevirostris.",
        "So it wasn't until the 1920s actually that this Danish oceanographer, Johannes Schmidt, made the connection between this fish that was called Leptocephalus brevirostris and the adult eel."
