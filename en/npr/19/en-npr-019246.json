        "And he was on these oceangoing vessels where they were catching these little fish larva out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.",
        "And these Italian biologists in the 1890s had seen some intermediate fish between the larva and the adult eel or the baby eels that are more, sort of, less willow-leaf shaped than more eel shaped.",
        "So based on that research that these Italian guys had done, this guy Johannes Schmidt said, well, hey, these little things floating in the middle of the ocean are actually the larvae of the European eel.",
        "And based on vertebra accounts and different things, he was able to prove that.",
        "But it wasn't really known until the early 20th century.",

        "In my youth, we in the Westport River, we had it seemed like hundreds of eels and they were always underfoot and they'd up in your minnow trap and they were everywhere and it was great.",
        "And now it seems to me - I'm still on the river and there are virtually none.",
        "I mean, I never see them.",

        "Unfortunately, we're witnessing a crash of populations of all 14 eel species around the world, these catadromous, oceangoing long-migrating eels.",
        "And they're not exactly sure what's causing it.",
        "But in Europe, they've observed that as much as a 99 percent drop in the population of eels, and it's happening in North America too.",
        "There's actually, in the book, a chapter about these two brothers from eastern Massachusetts who tried to list the eels as an endangered species, Doug and Tim Watts.",
        "And you can find a lot on the Web about their work.",
        "They have a website.",
        "They think that one of the main reasons is hydropower dams - is that eels migrate back to the ocean in the fall, the ones that are ready to reproduce.",
        "And unfortunately, they run when the rivers are in flood, taking advantage of the rain from the hurricane season and they're trying to take the path of least resistance down the rivers back to the ocean and they expend as little energy as possible.",
        "And when they encounter hydropower dam, they feel the pull from these penstock tubes that bring the water to the turbines.",
        "And the power companies haven't figured out a way to keep them from going down these tubes into the turbines.",
        "And you can imagine a long, skinny fish has trouble getting through a turbine.",
        "It's like, you know, for a human sticking your hand in the window fan, they just get chopped up.",
        "Or even if they get nicked, you know, if they're even wounded a little bit, it really hinders them on a thousands-of-mile journey.",
        "So that's one thing.",
        "But the reality is it's probably cumulative effects from many things pollution, overfishing.",
        "A lot of our eels were going to Asia in the '90s.",
        "They're still being overfished in different parts of the world.",
        "There's a huge multibillion dollar industry driven by Japan's, sort of, lust for their slightly fatty flesh.",
        "But it can't be blamed just on overfishing.",
        "In North America, the predominant fishery for eels is for bait for straight bait.",
        "So it's they're not taking a huge amount in the States.",
        "But I would say hydro dams and possibly even global warming which is possibly changing ocean currents and confounding eels on their migrations.",
        "Because they're following these currents as if they were braids of rivers in the ocean, but possibly also disease and parasites, but really, they don't quite know.",
        "But there is a drop happening.",
        "Okay, Jack.",
        "Thanks very much for that question.",

        "But the style of fishing is a Native American tradition, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "These two big stonewalls that form a V, basically, in the river and the trap is at the vortex is all really set up for one in the fall when the eels migrate, you know.",
        "And they come down en mass down the river.",
        "So, in two nights, he can catch as many as 2,000 fish.",
        "But they've been you know, this traditional weir fishery hasn't really changed in thousands of years.",
        "Apparently, have evidence of people fishing the same way 5,000 years ago in Connecticut and Maine.",
        "So we were there to see this eel weir and how it works, and talk with Ray Turner.",
