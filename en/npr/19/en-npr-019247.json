        "Well, prepare eels?",
        "Well, in Japan, they say they steam it, but it's really grilling it.",
        "And they grill it over a wood fire and they dip it in water over and over.",
        "And then they put a sweet sauce on it.",
        "This is a typical unagi you'd get in the restaurant.",
        "And the sweet sauce is a mix of mirin, a sweet red sweet rice wine and soy, predominantly, I think.",

        "The eels that are exported to the Asia the only state now that allows the export of eels to Asia is Maine and they - because they haven't figured out how to reproduce eels in captivity, they have to catch the babies right when they're first returning from the ocean.",
        "And they ship the babies to farms in China where they're raised because it's cheap in China to raise them for the Japanese market.",
        "But if you eat eel in a sushi restaurant, for instance, in New York, that fish - there's a good that fish was born in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, caught in the mouth of a river as a baby in Maine, shipped to a farm in China, raised to edible size, about 18 inches, killed, cleaned, pre-prepared, packaged and shipped back to New York.",
        "You know, it's already cooked.",
        "It's - if you ask a restaurant to look at the packaging, they can show you, it's all in Chinese.",
        "But - so it's one of the least sustainable routes to market of any fish.",
        "And it's, you know, you talk about farm-raised versus wild fish, the eel is sort of a little of both because it's a wild-caught fish that's then farm-raised."

        "Also, it's really unusual because if - in the case of the North American eel, which is native from pretty much the St. Lawrence River in Canada down to Florida, around into the Gulf and all the way into Central America, every fish from every one of those East Coast rivers, as far as we know, goes to one place to spawn in the middle of the ocean.",
        "It's completely different, as far as I can tell, from any other fish.",
        "So you get a mixing of - whatever survived from that particular generation returns to that place to spawn.",
        "They call it a panmixia, which is basically a giant orgy.",
        "They all mix their collective, you know, eggs and milt.",
        "And so you could have an eel from - a female eel from the St. Lawrence River mixing its eggs with the milt from or sperm from an eel that spent its adult life in Florida, a male eel, and the offspring could end up in Maine.",
        "So it's sort of an interesting evolutionary strategy because you have all these adult fish that are tested in all kinds of climactic conditions, and they all return to one place.",
        "So whatever survives that particular year should be fairly adapted at surviving, you know, if there's rapid change, I guess, maybe they can survive it, because if you consider that eels supposedly have been around in this form for like 15 million years, they've survived all kinds of climactic changes."
