        "I think the justices in general try very hard to look at both sides of every case and oftentimes at oral arguments you hear a lot of jousting, not only between the bench and the lawyers, but also among the justices themselves.",
        "But let me say one thing about the legal issue in this case, which is that--I think it's interesting for people like Justice Scalia who are people who like to--judges who like to read the plain language of statutes and to go with the original intention behind statutes.",
        "This is a case in which the plain language of the statute protects persons from discrimination who are making and enforcing contracts.",
        "And there's no dispute here that Mr. McDonald in his individual capacity is the person who is making and enforcing contracts and, as his complaint alleges, was discriminated against by Domino's.",
        "And so the fact that he wasn't making and enforcing a contract that--in which he, himself, was the party but rather his corporation was the party to the contract...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...isn't a factor taken into account in the statute itself.",
        "And this statute was the first Civil Rights Act passed by Congress after the Civil War.",
        "It was passed in 1866...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...during Reconstruction at the very beginning in order to protect the economic equality and opportunities for newly freed blacks to engage in economic activity on a par with all other persons in the country.",
        "Right.",
        "And so to some extent, I think one can make a pretty good argument that the type of discrimination that Mr. McDonald alleges here falls within the purpose of the statute as it was originally conceived by Congress.",
        "All right.",
