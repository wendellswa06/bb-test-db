        "I think that, clearly, there's, you know, with some segments of the population and with, you know, town hall people and protestors showing up with signs, you know, depicting Barack Obama's, you know, witch doctor and every other kind of thing in between, there still are some people who harbor a lot of, you know, negative, racist views of black Americans.",

        "I think one of the important things to remember about \"\"The Cosby Show\"\" is what it did for black television and what - how it made it possible - legitimized the notion that black families could be as civilized as white families who were being portrayed in sitcoms at the time.",
        "And it created a kind of complete reversal of the relationship between black and white sitcoms.",
        "Well, as you mentioned in your introduction, it can consist of a variety of things.",
        "So, we kind of loosely defined it as any behavior that members or animals of the same sex engage in that animals of opposite sexes also engage in, in the context of reproduction.",
        "So, that could be anything from courtship to preening, to rearing young together, to actual copulation.",
