        "Now give us a few examples of the same-sex behavior in some animals.",
        "What do they do?",
        "What does it consist of?",
        "Bob Mondello is our man on film and on the Bond beat.",
        "And this contrast with other species such as Laysan albatross in which females form long-term pair bonds together and they actually build a nest together.",
        "They'll incubate an egg together and rear the chick.",
        "So there's a wide variety of different manifestations of the behavior.",
        "Now, I would think that in these cases the aim of these kinds of partnerships is often for reproduction, particularly in animals where they don't send flowers and check, quote poetry.",
        "What is going on?",
        "Why are the animals doing this if in many cases it's not going to lead to reproduction?",
        "That's a great question, and it does come up a lot, so it's good to clarify.",
        "And what we like to point out is that sex isn't always about sex.",
        "So, even in opposite sex interactions, sexual - or behaviors that look sexual on the surface can have other functions.",
        "They could function in pair bonding or they could be involved in dominance or aggressive interactions.",
        "So, the first thing to keep in mind is that it's not always about sex.",
        "And the second thing to keep in mind is that animals do a variety of behaviors, from aggression to altruistic behaviors where there's no apparent benefit to the actor, where it's not entirely clear how it leads directly to reproduction.",
        "So, we view same-sex sexual behavior in kind of the same framework as a behavior that may be sexual, but is not necessarily all about sex.",
        "Let me ask a loaded question that may be impossible to answer.",
        "Is this behavior aberrant behavior of some sort, or can we not address that kind of question?",
        "Well, no. I think it's important to discuss that question.",
        "And when we looked at the literature in the field, we found many, many, many examples of these sorts of behavior.",
        "So from that point of view, it's not aberrant.",
        "The question about what its ultimate function is - its evolutionary function is still a very open question, and there are lots of hypotheses out there about that.",
        "And so some people can consider it to be adaptive in some circumstances.",
        "But there's evidence that it's not adaptive in other circumstances, and that it may just be a byproduct of, say, selection on another trait.",
        "So - and that would vary from one species to another, depending on the particulars of why they're engaging in this behavior and exactly what the behavior is."

        "Precisely.",
        "And in addition to that, it could vary between different contexts even within the same species.",
        "So it just kind of increases the variety of behaviors that can be observed.",
        "What happens in fruit flies?",
        "That seems to be a far-removed example.",
        "What do they do in terms of same-sex behavior?",
        "So, fruit flies do engage in same-sex behavior in a kind of a wild setting, where males will court or attempt to copulate with other males.",
        "But the vast majority of research in fruit flies has been done in the lab.",
        "And these experience or manipulative experiments where, for example, researchers may knock out a particular gene that's involved in the recognition of sex-specific peptides or sex-specific pheromones.",
        "So if you remove that sort of gene or you alter it in a male fruit fly, that male fruit fly may subsequently court or mount other males as well as females, and in essence, it's because they can't really tell, you know, to whom they are directing their courtship advances.",
        "Right.",
        "So do you conclude - let's get back to the evolutionary question again, the evolutionary advantage and so forth.",
        "Do we assume that some of these animals engaging in same-sex behavior are suffering an evolutionary disadvantage as a result of that?",
        "I think that would be very difficult to tell.",
        "And again, you would have to have kind of an explicit framework of hypothesis testing.",
        "So, I mean, you could test - scientists can test different hypotheses for - that would explain the existence of same-sex behavior in animals.",
        "For example, same-sex behavior might mediate dominance interactions or it might provide practice for later opposite sex sexual encounters.",
        "Or, it may not have any apparent function or it may be a byproduct of other - of selection on other traits.",
        "And so by explicitly testing that, you can begin to get at some of those questions.",
        "Now, I've been saving up a question for you here, and I want to make sure we have time to address it.",
        "Okay.",
        "An obvious thing that I'm sure has occurred to many listeners - and certainly occurred to me when I read it - is what are the implication in this for human same-sex behavior?"

        "So the implications for human same-sex behavior - well, so first of all, our review - in our review, we attempted to distill all of the works that we were reading into the very kind of scientific essence of the data.",
        "We wanted to strip it of all the kind of political and emotional baggage just so that we could be as accurate and neutral in tone as possible.",

        "We have a section in the paper on just a sampling of the studies that have been done on human beings - and in fact there are loads of studies on human beings.",
        "And one of the conclusions that we came to is that research on other animals could benefit from using some of the same techniques that have been used on research in humans.",
        "What's an example?",
        "So an example of that is genome-wide scans have looked at the genetic architecture of sexual orientation in human beings with varying degrees of success.",
        "Right.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So it's kind of correlating, you know, a particular chromosomal location with the existence of the behavior.",
        "And to our knowledge, we certainly didn't find any evidence in the animal literature that people are using a similar approach now, with the exception of Drosophila research which has looked extensively at genetic pathways involved in same-sex sexual behavior.",

        "But what I would like to accomplish is to shift the perspective a bit and start considering these traits as evolutionary forces in and of themselves.",
        "So, for example, if you have a population of animals with a certain frequency of same-sex behavior in it, that same-sex behavior is going to change the social context that all of the animals in the population experience.",
        "And this will have kind of knock-on effects on evolutionary pressures on other traits, other social traits or maybe even morphological, or like anatomical traits."
