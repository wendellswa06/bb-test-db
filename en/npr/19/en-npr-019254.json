        "Reckless, outrageous and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as telling it like it is when it is actually just reckless, outrageous and undignified.",
        "And Senator Flake expanded on those thoughts in an interview with NPR.",
        "I think we know by, you know, nine months into the administration that the pivot that we all hope for is not coming.",
        "And before this becomes the new normal, I think we have to stand up and say this is not normal.",
        "And if we don't stand up now, I think we're going to lose that chance.",
        "Now, it is not exactly news that Flake is critical of President Trump.",
        "He has been that way since well before the election.",
        "But here's the other part of this story.",
        "Even as Flake said it was time to stand up, he said he is retiring from the Senate.",
        "He's not going to seek re-election in 2018.",
        "So where does this leave the Republican Party?",
        "Let's put that question to NPR's Ron Elving and NPR's Tamara Keith who cover Washington - both have for years.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Can't say that I have or at least not in a long time.",
        "I think we'd have to go back to the very last year of the Watergate crisis - that would be 1973 - to find a time when Republicans were using terms of this kind to question the fundamental integrity of a member of their own party in the White House.",
        "Fundamental integrity - are you telling me that this is about character rather than issues?",
        "It is about character, Steve.",
        "It's not about policy.",
        "It's not about politics.",

        "We've heard Republicans have plenty of quarrels between themselves, among themselves, over those kinds of issues before.",
        "It's just the era of Trump has completely discombobulated what had always been the party of unity and the party that we expected to fall in line.",
        "Discombobulated - always happy when we get that into our coverage here.",
        "Tam, what does Jeff Flake get out of retirement?",
        "Why not stay if he feels so strongly about the direction of the country and the president?",
        "Well, two things - staying may not have been an option for him.",
        "His re-election chances - he was definitely in peril in terms of re-election.",
        "Here's the other thing - if you look at his colleague from Arizona, John McCain - Senator John McCain - he was always a maverick until about a year before re-election, and then he'd sort of calibrate.",
        "Well, now, Jeff Flake doesn't have to calibrate for re-election.",
        "He can say what he wants to say and do what he wants to do."

        "But let me ask you about something else because Jeff Flake said he did not want to be complicit - did not want his colleagues to be complicit.",
        "So when we had our interview with him, we asked about two friends of Jeff Flake who are not going to retire.",
        "Let's listen to a little bit of that conversation.",
        "Is your longtime friend and past collaborator Vice President Mike Pence part of the problem?",
        "Oh, I'm a good friend of Mike Pence, and I think the world of him.",

        "Isn't the vice president doing the same thing, if that's what it is?",
        "Well, I have to hope that in their private moments he's trying to prevail on the president to change his behavior as it relates to members of Congress or Gold Star families or others.",
        "Is Speaker Ryan part of the problem?",
        "Paul is a good man with a tough job, and I think that, you know, certainly during the campaign on a number of occasions and a few times since, he's stood up.",
        "I think that we obviously need to do more.",
        "Ron Elving, what do you hear there?",
        "He has a tough answer to give on the Mike Pence question in particular, as all Republicans do.",
        "It is completely expected that the vice president will be utterly loyal no matter what his private thoughts may be.",
        "And certainly, Mike Pence has upheld that, most recently yesterday by coming out and casting yet another tie-breaking vote in the Senate to kill a rule that would've restrained Wall Street a little bit, a rule that came out of the 2008 mortgage crisis - something that would have protected the rights in court of people who had beefs with their financial institutions.",
        "He will have to be on the Trump line on every occasion.",
        "And Mike Pence, even as president, would probably look a lot like Donald Trump in terms of policy.",
        "In terms of policy."
