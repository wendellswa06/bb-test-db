        "Well, I have one sister.",
        "And my sister and I had sort of opposite reactions to our family situation.",
        "My sister wanted to make a lot of noise and get the attention that she felt she deserved.",
        "So she became sort of angry and acted out and would do things to kind of get, you know, her parents' attention because they weren't really paying that much attention to us because they had their own issues or problems.",
        "And I took the opposite route.",
        "I decided I didn't want to be any more of a problem to anyone in the family.",
        "And so I sort of removed myself by reading books and staying in the library and studying plants and insects in the backyard and just sort of building my own private world that felt safe.",
        "And I felt like I was doing something for my family by just sort of being a non-problem and not making any fusses and just kind of being quiet and peaceful.",
        "As I understand it from the book, you were warned by several people, including your sister and your mother, not to write about this.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Well, part of it was practical.",
        "My father, being a gambling addict, is always looking for money (laughter).",
        "So I think they were worried, well, what if he sues you?",
        "Part of it was that.",
        "But I think every family has a secret.",
        "Every family has darkness and heaviness that people would prefer to not talk about.",
        "And when you choose to become the person who's going to bring light to the dark family secrets, you can sometimes be perceived as the betrayer.",
        "And I think that my story's not unusual in that way.",
        "I think that there's a lot of people who can relate to that.",
        "So I think they were warning me in that sense, like, oh, well, do you really want all this on you?",
        "And I was so beyond that point when I started writing it.",
        "I just - I was so ready to do it, and I was so ready for all of the light to shine on the story.",
        "So it didn't - it didn't faze me.",
        "What about him?",
        "Has your father read it?",
        "Do you think he will read it?",
        "He knows about the book, but I don't think he's read it.",
        "And I don't know if he will.",
        "I imagine he would want to.",
        "But his reaction - I am sort of bracing myself for that, you know?",
        "I don't know.",
        "Most people who know him will say, well, he's going to be really upset because this is kind of revealing all of the things that he would like to hide.",
        "But other people say, well, he's kind of an ego maniac, so maybe he'll love it, you know?",
        "(Laughter) I don't know.",

        "The only time I've seen a white lung has been in somebody that had died.",
