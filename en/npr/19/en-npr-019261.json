        "This isn't what the State Department does for a living.",
        "It isn't part of their culture.",

        "They've done this on a much smaller scale.",
        "The State Department has its own security force that protects diplomats - the Bureau of Diplomatic Security.",
        "But that force of 2,000 covers the entire world.",
        "So Zakheim says in the short term the State Department should reach out to the Pentagon to come up with more inspectors, more auditors, to help oversee the contractor security force in Iraq - a contractor force that may include the company once known as Blackwater.",
        "It just renamed itself Academi.",
        "Our role in Iraq today is we do not have a role.",
        "That's company president Ted Wright.",

        "The goal with a long-form story is the exact opposite of that, right?",

        "That's the hope, is you want people to really sit and spend some time with what you're doing.",
        "Now there's also this setting in the app that lets the reader default to almost just a text-only view - right?",
        "- to make it easier to read.",
        "And you're not bombarded with ads and banners.",
        "But without people seeing and clicking on these ads, I mean, how does this stuff get paid for?",

        "We have really good relationships with all of the publishers that are in the app.",
        "And what we have found is that people are overwhelmingly happy to have their stuff featured in this site and on the app.",

        "No.",
        "I think that's changing, at the moment.",
        "I mean, I think there's a bunch of experiments that people are running, where they're trying to figure out pay models.",
        "So I don't know that anyone has figured out a sort of perfect business model that relies solely on long-form journalism - although I'd also say that I don't know that anyone figured that out before the Internet.",
        "I'm not sure there was ever a super lucrative business model around this kind of work."
