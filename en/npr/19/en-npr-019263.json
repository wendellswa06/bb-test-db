        "Well, I think any time you have the candidates up there like this, you're trying to get them to be a little bit spontaneous and give people a little bit of their personality.",
        "And kind of the dynamic between a candidate and his wife is, once again, a glimpse into that.",
        "And every first lady picks her own issues that she wants to spotlight, and she draws a lot of attention to them, like Michelle Obama with childhood nutrition and obesity.",
        "But that's not really the kind of thing that you look at.",
        "I mean, nobody votes for a president based on kind of what issues or how competent their wife will be.",
        "It is more a reflection of the man himself."
