        "The availability of credit to people to buy their own homes, the availability of credit to people to smooth consumption, you know, broadly that's a good thing.",
        "But clearly the last couple of years it's just gone crazy.",
        "And loans have been made that people couldn't possibly repay.",
        "Well, now, let me figure this out.",
        "You're saying that it has been, at least until recently, a very good thing that people had so many more options, that they could smooth out their incomes, they have all kinds of opportunities, because credit is available that should be a good thing.",
        "But is there something about the availability of credit itself that causes people to go off the rails and make bad decisions?",
        "Well, one of the things that worries me is evidence from what you might call behavioral economics or what you might call economic psychology about the way we sometimes make short-term decisions.",
        "And we seem to be hardwired sometimes to just make rash decisions in the short term.",
        "For example, economists offered their experimental subjects a choice of a snack.",
        "Do you want fruit or do you want chocolate?",
        "And depending on when they were offered the snack - do you want to eat it now or do you want it in a week's time - people would make different decisions.",
        "They would choose chocolate now, but if you said, well, what do you eat in a week's time, people would think forward, then think, well, fruit is healthier, I'll pick fruit.",
        "Oh, no way.",
        "As long as they don't have to eat it now?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Because what would happen is a week down the track, the economists who did the experiment would show up with the fruit.",
        "And you know, here's the fruit you asked for.",
        "By the way, would you like to swap for a Hershey bar?",
        "And then suddenly would go, yeah, I must have been crazy a week ago when I thought I wanted fruit.",
        "Give me the chocolate now.",
        "So is the analogy there that if you have to save and wait several years before you can buy a house, you might buy a house you can afford, but if you can buy any house today, you might buy something that's completely irresponsible and beyond your means or just risky; you don't know if you're going to be able to pay it off?",
        "Or you might decide to buy some clothes, a car, a hi-fi now.",
        "Because right now that seems like, you know, the thing you really want to do.",
        "But if you were to be asked in a week's time, if you were to see that designer handbag, if you saw the perfect pair of shoes, would you buy it?",
        "You'd go no, no, no. you know, I can't afford to spend money like that on shoes.",
        "But then when you actually get down the track and you're right there, you have the credit card, so you can buy it, you know, instantly with no consequences.",
        "The consequences come further down the track."

        "So one of the things that economists are trying to think about now is how do we help people to reflect that longer term perspective in the decisions they make today.",
        "One thing that they're doing, for example, economists have designed a pension-saving system called Save More Tomorrow.",
        "What they do is they've teamed up with companies and the companies offer their employees the usual choice, you know, would you like to contribute some of your salary to your pension plan?",
        "But it's not phrased in the usual way.",
        "Rather than saying do you want to do that now, they say, you know, nine months down the track, a year down the track, you're going to get a pay rise; at that point do you want us to send you a pay rise direct into your pension account?",
        "When people are given that choice, that's suddenly a lot more attractive.",
        "People are very keen.",
        "So everybody's who's always meaning to save next year is given the opportunity to actually commit to save next year?",

        "And I'd like to know, Mr. Harford, if the national savings rate went back up again from point four percent up to 10, 11, 12 percent, would we be better off?",
        "I think it depends how high it goes.",
        "The basic tradeoff is this.",
        "If you want to be richer in the future, the obvious way to do that is to save rather than spend now.",
        "But generally we get richer in the future because we get smarter, because technology improves and so on.",
        "So how much do you want to sacrifice your income now for income later when you're, you know, when you're richer?",
        "I think about my own experience.",
        "Fifteen years ago I was a student.",
        "And I was one of those rare students - I was studying economics, right, so, you know, we're all kind of perverse and a bit different - who actually saved money.",
        "You know, I got myself a job.",
        "I was really careful about the money I spent.",
        "Now, did I make the right decision?",
        "I made completely the wrong decision.",

        "And you know, now I wouldn't even notice.",
