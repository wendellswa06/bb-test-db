        "Now, sales of digital songs have gone up 49 percent.",
        "But according to Eric Garland, who runs a Web site called BigChampagne that tracks music online, digital hits, the ones with legs, tend to be purchased by older people, for themselves and their kids and grandkids.",

        "It is absolutely vital for the future of the music community that we don't allow these two industries to basically lock down the Internet in the same way that Clear Channel and several other large corporations locked down commercial radio."
