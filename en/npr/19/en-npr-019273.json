        "And finally, one of these employees actually filed a formal complaint with the EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a week ago, in which he formally complained about this.",

        "So there's a history of tensions there, you know, but it's not to say that everyone in that town is you know, is at odds.",
        "I mean, there are certainly a lot of folks both black and white of goodwill who wish that these problems didn't keep recurring, but there's a lot of other folks who basically - a lot of folks insisted there's no problems there, it's just outsiders who are stirring things up and you know, they claim that it if people would just leave Paris alone and they could deal with their own problems.",
