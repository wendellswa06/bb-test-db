        "They were not interested in speculating at all.",

        "Typically in an investigation like this, they'll scout the suspect's background, checking for any sort of notes that might have been left behind or anything written on social media, but the FBI believes he was working independently.",
        "Now, the U.S.",
        "attorney in Eastern Tennessee spoke at this news conference, and he called the shooting an act of domestic terrorism.",
        "He backtracked on that language later.",
