        "Do we have any idea where they were headed?",

        "They'd initially indicated after their first few hours of deliberations that they were 10 votes for guilty and two votes for not guilty.",
        "And as the deliberations went on, the prospect of a hung jury became more likely and the two sides began negotiating a plea agreement.",
        "And just as they finished that plea deal, the jury reached a verdict.",
        "And in fact, as they were finalizing the plea agreement, the bailiff was entering the courtroom with a note saying the jury had reached a guilty verdict.",
        "Of course, that verdict was never delivered because of the deal that had happened.",
        "This was the very same jury that I gather had sent a question to the judge - how many jurors would have to vote for a verdict to make it unanimous?",
        "Yeah, in a - in what's been a very emotional and very serious saga and a very emotional trial, that was one of the lighter moments.",
        "One of their first questions to the judge was how many votes does it take for us to be unanimous.",
        "And he informed them that all 12 had to concur with the opinion.",
        "This was a trial about two things - on the one hand, the guilt or innocence of Ed Graf and the other the validity of the kind of evidence that was used to convict him the first time - arson evidence.",
        "His - his story notwithstanding, there's been something of a revolution in how that evidence is viewed nowadays."
