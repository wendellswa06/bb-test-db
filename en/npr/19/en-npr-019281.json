        "Yeah, the Ed Graf case is really part of a complete overhaul in how we view fire investigations and fire science.",
        "Just about everything that fire investigators once believed were indicators of arson have now been shown to be unreliable.",
        "And many of the burn patterns and other indicators that fire investigators used for decades to convict people of arson have shown to essentially be junk science.",
        "We have a much better understanding of how fire behaves now.",
        "And arson cases are prosecuted under, you know, what is now probably true science.",
        "And that science would lead the experts to believe that the fire in the Ed Graf case was in fact accidental.",
        "And that's what some nationally-known experts testified to over the past two weeks.",
        "Ed Graf's case was championed by the Texas Innocence Project.",
        "What did they say about him suddenly pleading guilty?",
        "Well, I think there's a little bit of confusion because the director of the Texas Innocence Project was quoted in the Waco paper kind of saying well, the most important thing here is the science and not whether each individual person is guilty or innocent.",
        "The most important thing is that we reexamine the science and that the proper fire science was offered in the courtroom, no matter what the verdict is.",
        "So I think there was a little bit of hedging there.",
        "The reality is that Ed Graf is going to get out of prison because of the quirk in Texas parole law.",
        "But I think that the fact he got up in court and admitted guilt definitely rattled some people who for a long time had believed in his innocence.",

        "I think it's my responsibility, and our responsibility as an organization, to make up for that and make the sports world welcoming not just in that one hockey locker room, but in every locker room at every level.",
        "What do you do when an athlete gets in touch with you?",
        "Most of what I do personally is a behind-the-scenes thing.",
