        "Program director Cindy Zedeck says kids gradually cut back the amount of junk food they eat, so it doesn't feel like a big change.",
        "This isn't a diet, Zedeck makes clear – a word that they never use with kids or parents.",
        "You're really signing up for six months of learning how to improve your eating and exercise habits for your lifetime.",
        "It's not a diet that you're on and then you're off at the end of the six months.",

        "Those changes also include exercise.",
        "Kids set goals around playing or doing sports for an hour each day.",
        "Often the hardest part for parents, Zedeck says, is figuring out how to talk to their kids about weight.",
        "A lot of parents call and say that their child has very high self-esteem, feels very confident, is very active but they're overweight.",
        "So they don't want to bring up their weight because they don't want to make them feel badly about it if it's not a current concern for them.",
        "The last thing a parent wants is to saddle a child with a self-image problem or eating disorder.",
        "So instead, Zedeck encourages parents to tell their child that the whole family could stand to be healthier, and the program is something they can do together.",
        "Thea Runyan, the health coach, says often, though, there are plenty of clues that a child actually wants help.",
        "For example, Gabriel asked his mom if he was fat.",
        "Other kids complain they can't keep up during soccer or basketball.",
        "But Runyan says parents, out of embarrassment or nervousness or their own issues with weight or food, can dismiss the problem.",
        "I think what happens when this issue comes up at home is the parent is quick to say, oh no, nothing's wrong, everything's fine, you're wonderful, I love you; instead of listening and saying OK, they're actually asking for help.",
        "The program here at Stanford has an enviable success rate.",
        "Since 1999, about 80 percent of the kids who've finished have achieved their body weight goals.",
        "Although most of the families here were referred by a pediatrician, health insurers won't pay for it.",
        "Instead, the costs are largely covered by grants for low-income families, while others pay out of pocket.",
        "For Gabriel, he says being with other kids who are overweight and trying to get healthier has kept him going."
