        "Well, what kind of message does that send not only to Americans but to people throughout the world?",

        "James Stewart, we're here talking about your new book, \"\"Tangled Webs.\"\" One common thread that struck me and all the people that you write about is that they ended up making things so much worse for themselves by lying, to the point in several of the cases where it was lying, perjury, that became the only thing they were charged with."
