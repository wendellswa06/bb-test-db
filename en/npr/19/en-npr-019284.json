        "They've asked for them and haven't received them.",
        "And also, people are supposed to email the ballots back and then also send the paper ballots back in.",
        "But I'm not sure that everybody fully understands that.",
        "So I think there's been, you know, a certain amount of confusion about the process.",
        "So, can you assess at this point the effect that the storm might have on voting in New Jersey, whether it's going to affect the number of people who are able to cast their votes or couldn't get to the polls?"
