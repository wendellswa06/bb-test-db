        "We get a little worrisome.",
        "Is how Michelle Krebs, an industry expert at Edmons.com, describes the latest sales figures.",
        "If you looked at the consumer confidence numbers this week, it shows you people are very nervous about their jobs, about the economy, and they just aren't spending money.",
        "Especially on big ticket items like cars.",
        "Krebs adds that for the first six months of the year, the relatively large number of fleet sales, say for rental cars, disguise the very weak consumer demand.",
        "The automakers tried to put a positive spin on yesterday's numbers, noting that June sales were higher than a year ago.",
        "But that's not saying much.",

        "Oftentimes that was an open question when the conventions began in those days.",
        "Not so much in 1948 on the presidential level, because they had an incumbent Democratic president in Harry Truman.",
        "But the platform was an enormously open issue.",
        "And among other things, the liberals - the mostly northern liberals like Hubert Humphrey and some others - were pushing hard to have a meaningful plank about civil rights.",
        "Harry Truman actually had a fairly aggressive program for pursuing the issue of segregation in the country, but he knew that at the convention in the summer of 1948 there would not be a lot of support for that.",
        "And he wanted as peaceful a convention as possible.",
        "He wanted to try to hold the party together.",
        "So he opposed the minority plank through his surrogates at the convention."
