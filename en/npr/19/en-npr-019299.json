        "So mice have been used almost exclusively in tuberculosis research for the last 30 or 40 years.",
        "And again, that allows a lot more experiments to be done for the same amount of money because mice are so efficient and so cheap.",
        "But there are problems, and in that particular case, mice just don't get the same kind of tuberculosis that humans get.",
        "So the question is any animal model you use for disease is going to be similar to the human version of the disease in some ways and different in other ways.",
        "If all of your experiments are done on the same animal, those differences are just going to keep coming up again and again and again.",

        "We'd have to figure out how to do all the things, all the genetic engineering we can do with mice.",
        "We'd have to figure out how to do that with some other animal, and we're starting to learn some of those things for animals like the marmoset and even the rat.",
        "But another idea would be to say, OK, we have all these wonderful tools for the mouse, but let's invest more money into at least developing the science of the naked mole rat, the marmoset, the python, whatever - some other animals that might have some other secrets to share about the nature of disease.",
