        "Dennis knocked down power lines and trees, but after it had passed, one official after another reiterated that it had been nowhere near as bad as people expected.",
        "Still, Escambia County administrator George Touart pointed out that it was a major storm.",
        "Yet the website has the potential to inform the TV channel's coverage, as in March, when Brian Lienas, a reporter for Fox News Latino, appeared on the Fox News Channel itself.",
        "Lienas was describing results of a Fox News Latino poll.",
        "He noted Hispanic voters care more about the economy than immigration, but said that the latter issue defines their moral compass.",
        "Nine in 10 support the DREAM Act, Eighty-five percent support undocumented workers working in this country.",
        "So, and if you ask them whether they prefer the word illegal versus undocumented, a majority of them believe that the word illegal, the term illegal immigrant, is offensive.",
        "I met Lienas and two of his Fox News Latino colleagues in a glass-walled conference room, as we could see two pundits heatedly arguing in a Fox News TV studio just a dozen feet away.",
        "Fox's Latino is different than Fox News.",

        "Analysts say this is genuinely a shock-and-awe package.",
        "The details are still vague, but here's what's been announced so far: The European Union will itself guarantee about $80 billion worth of loans to countries in financial difficulty.",

        "The financial assistance by the commission and by the member states and the actions taken today by the ECB proves that we shall defend the euro, whatever it takes.",
        "Rehn's reference to defending the euro is in keeping with the language used over the last few days by many European leaders.",
        "They claim the euro has been under attack by speculators, and say its slide in financial markets has been irrational.",
        "The Swedish finance minister yesterday said the markets have shown, quote, \"\"wolf pack behavior.\"\" The European leaders felt they needed to send a strong message that no country in the euro zone would be allowed to fail.",
