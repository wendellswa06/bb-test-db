        "What's the importance of that change to the constitution and what is it?",
        "Well, the change to the constitution was initially promised to the Sunnis as a price for their participation in elections, and it was believed from the very early on to be absolutely necessary for keeping Iraq together and coming up with the formula that would make this country work.",
        "This is giving Sunni Muslims who lost a lot of power with the fall of Saddam Hussein some larger voice in government?",
        "That's correct.",
        "They initially boycotted participation in the political process in Iraq because of that loss of power.",
        "And these revisions to the constitution is meant to give them back some of those powers.",
        "Well, I have to note that although today was the deadline, we've already heard - actually yesterday - from Iraq's parliament that a committee set to study amendments to the constitution failed to agree on a number of issues and wants an extension.",
        "Well, it was to be expected.",
        "There does not exist in Iraq a framework for negotiations towards some kind of agreement.",
        "And the chaos in the parliament is not the reason why there is an agreement.",
        "It's actually a reflection of the absence of that agreement.",
        "They're an enemy of Turkey.",

        "I want to also mention that he's not the only high-profile prisoner to die in a federal facility.",
        "For example, the convicted mob boss Whitey Bulger was killed in a federal prison in 2018 just a day after he was transferred there.",
        "And I just - I understand that these individuals are not people who elicit a great deal of sympathy from the general public.",
        "But what would you say to the public to persuade them that they should take note of this and that it actually does matter?",
        "I guess the question is, why does it matter that people die in these facilities?",
        "When we lose sight of the importance of our Constitution and upholding our systems of justice, then we slide a little bit - not to sound dramatic, but we slide a little closer to anarchy.",
        "We in the criminal justice field have a moral, ethical and legal responsibility to uphold our systems of justice.",
        "And that's for the victims.",
        "I frankly don't really care about Jeffrey Epstein.",
        "But I care about our systems of justice, and these kinds of things just can't happen."

        "Good to be with you.",
        "So, this week, Secretary Henry Paulson announced he was changing the $700 billion financial rescue plan to focus more on providing consumer credit.",
        "So, yesterday, he came on NPR's All Things Considered and told host Robert Siegel he believed the government was making progress.",
        "I think in terms of the challenges, in terms of working through this economic downturn, let me tell you, it took a long time to build up these excesses.",
        "This is going to take a good while to work through this period.",
        "And the first focus, as I said yesterday, should be on recovery and repair.",
        "So, Errin, there are mixed reviews from politicians, from journalists, from the market to this idea of really changing around what the bailout plan is.",
        "But in general, do you think that we are moving in the right direction, or are there signs that we are moving in the right direction?",
        "Well, I think like Secretary Paulson said, you know, he mentioned this being about recovery and repair and confidence in the market, and so, he's indicated that this now may be the best way to right the market and get the economy headed in the direction that he would like to take it in.",
        "At the same time, you've got, you know, certainly consumers, politicians, journalists and other observers kind of balking what appears to be a bait and switch."

        "And I'm going to talk a little bit about the auto industry in a second.",
        "But first of all, overall, what do you think people in Detroit are looking at in the next four or five years in terms of changes to the city and changes to the economy?",
        "They're really, really very worried about what's going on with the auto industry.",
        "There have been phrases used, words used in the past several weeks that, you know, I've never heard in my, you know, 40-plus years here in Detroit, you know, questions about whether General Motors or Ford are going to survive.",
        "You know, back in the '80s, there was talk about Chrysler, but never General Motors and Ford.",
        "And that really has people here quite concerned about their livelihoods because just about everybody knows somebody who works for an automaker or has a relative who works for an automaker or in one way or another is tied to the automakers.",
        "So, people are really worried about whether the city of Detroit is going to be able to survive if General Motors goes away.",
        "A part of what's happened recently is the city council is asking for a bailout package now of $10 billion because they're so worried about it.",
        "So, I mean, that's the watchword of the day, is really - worry and anxiety.",
        "Well, let's talk specifically about bailing out automakers.",
        "Auto sales have dropped 5.5 percent, and there's a question about whether or not the government should step in, whether there should be an auto-bailout bill.",
        "There's a proposal in the Senate to loan $25 billion to GM and Ford and Chrysler.",
        "But a lot of politicians are saying, no, we can't spend this money, you know, whether it's - that they don't want to spend it on this or whether they don't want to spend any more money, period.",
        "So, what is the assessment on the ground in Detroit?",
        "Obviously, Detroit has a very vested interest in this.",
        "But what's the assessment on the ground of whether or not a bailout could help the automakers and thus help Detroit?",
        "I think just about everybody is biased in Detroit, obviously.",
        "I mean, most people think this would be a good thing.",
        "It's going to help the automakers get through this rough patch, but it's not as unanimous as you might think.",
        "I mean, I think there are a number of people who say, all right, bailouts aren't necessarily going to work.",
        "They're not bailing me out, you know, with my mortgage, they're not bailing me out with my small business.",
        "So, I think there is some anger there, too, at the same time.",
        "But I think most people understand that they want to keep the auto industry going, because that's their livelihood, you know, in some degree of separation.",
        "There are so many different things going on.",
        "It's like politics is like, not just a three-ring circus right now, it's about a 75-ring circus.",

        "And we see that other candidates are attacking him for this.",

        "The question is can he get in line with the modern Democratic Party without looking feckless and out of touch?",
        "And No. 2, if he ends up being the nominee, can he get there without having to move too far to the left in a way that would hurt him in a general election?",
        "And just briefly, though, I mean, there is a left wing of the party.",
        "And we're seeing two candidates really fighting for who will occupy the progressive spot, right?"
