        "Well, partly that the United States is looking for a way to extricate itself from Iraq, and also to put pressure on the Iraqi government to achieve desired goals without actually helping the Iraqi government with a negotiations process, with a regional engagement that would facilitate this.",

        "How do demands for benchmarks solve domestic political problems for Americans?",
        "Because it passes the responsibility for solving Iraq's problems solely to the Iraqi government and to Iraqi politicians.",
        "But it does not really put forward regional framework around which they actually could negotiate.",
        "It might be even more useful if the U.S.",

        "And certainly, things like - things that would be perceived as, you know, life-threatening are going to get a closer look and will be - and people will be calling for more swift action against people who would make such threats even if it is on a wall of, you know, quote, unquote, free expression.",

        "That's going to continue happening.",
        "And once Barack Obama is president, I think they should be taken the same way as threats against any president are taken - very seriously, very legally.",
