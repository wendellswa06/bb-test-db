        "I'm well, thank you.",
        "What's the difference between the traditional route and online?",
        "I would say the traditional route is what I experienced with my third child, through an agency called Bethany Christian Services, local.",
        "And the online I think gave us just much broader spectrum of exposure to birth parents and therefore shortened our waiting time with each of our children.",
        "So it sounds like you had a good experience.",
        "We've had four wonderful experiences, we really have.",
        "And this was an online agency you went through.",
        "Yes, we went with - the name is American Adoptions, and they're based in Kansas, and even though we are in Pennsylvania, we were able to do everything without ever meeting.",
        "And we matched very quickly with our children.",
        "It was a wonderful experience.",
        "It turned out to be wonderful, but the first time you did it, did you have any qualms?",
        "Well, the first time you do it, it's like - it's the big black hole.",
        "There's an awful lot of paperwork, and when I first began this journey of adoption, I really did not know anyone who had adopted.",
        "But now I know hundreds of families that have adopted.",
        "It is kind of nice to have the support.",
        "You would think that by using an online agency you may not have the support that you need, but I actually found it to be the opposite.",
        "I think they're just - you know, they've been there for you every step of the way: your paperwork, matching with the birth mother, you're showing your profiles and also seeing you through up to several years after you've adopted, if you have questions, with talking about adoption with your kids, et cetera.",
        "So having had that good experience, why did you decide later to try to the more traditional route?"

        "Well, you know, at the time we had two adopted children, we had two girls, and we wanted to have a boy.",
        "And the agency we were using was not offering gender-specific adoption.",
        "So we went with Bethany, a local agency, who was, and adopted our son.",
        "And then when we were going for our fourth child, by that time American Adoptions had gone and made it so that you could be gender-specific.",
        "But we had wonderful experience with Bethany, as well.",
        "And the difference, again, primarily the length of time.",
        "How - can you give us an idea of how much that was?",
        "Well, the length of time with my first child was about two and a half months.",
        "We matched with her.",
        "She was born in Florida.",
        "And our second child we only waited six days.",
        "And our third child through Bethany, actually we handed our paperwork and became activated and that very day got a call about our son, who was three months old and living with a local foster family.",
        "And three days later we had him at home.",
        "And our last child, I think because we already had three kids, I'm not sure how appealing we were to birth parents, but somebody picked us.",
        "It took about 12 months to match with our fourth child.",
        "And you understand, you've talked to hundreds of adoptive families, those first three experiences are pretty unusual.",
        "Actually, they're not.",
        "You know, maybe the third one, waiting one day, but that's primarily why I do the support group and I've given seminars in the tri-state area because I want to get the word out there to people that adopting domestically is not only not difficult but can be wonderful.",
        "And I think people often are threatened by possible relationship with the birth parent because you are, you know, sort of more local.",
        "But it's exactly the opposite.",
        "It's been very easy, and what a gift to be able to have a semi-open or open adoption with your birth parents.",

        "And I met someone who was going through a local brick-and-mortar agency in Maryland, very near to here, who was told the average wait, two to three years, but then it actually, he was told, would be longer because of the Internet, because birth mothers in Maryland were suddenly communicating with prospective adoptive parents all over the country and maybe, you know, letting them adopt their children instead of keeping it within this local area.",

        "I heard stories of, you know, adoption agencies getting calls from birth mothers in a panic attack in the ER room.",

        "And one of those experiences, we had a birth mom that pretty much used us for monetary support while she was having the baby, and then I don't believe she ever intended to place.",
        "And then the other experience was phone calls that we received from someone claiming to be from a fundamentalist Christian family.",
        "You know, it was kind of during that fundamentalist, all the news stories about all that.",
        "And so I'm pretty sure it was just someone taking advantage of some - I don't even know how many crazy emails we got from people claiming to have babies to place with us.",
        "And we went through an agency that also had an online website, and so we kind of felt protected, but we still kind of had those issues.",
        "And when we brought them up to our adoption counselor, he just kind of said, well, yeah, that's the way it is for everybody.",
