        "We did go through an agency, an independent adoption center, and we had a profile with them, and we also created our own blog on the Internet to reach out to potential birth mothers.",

        "And did you give information - and forgive me if I'm - tell me to shut up if I'm probing too hard - did you give information about your financial status, and did you give information about the kind of financial support you might be able to offer a birth mother?",
        "No, absolutely not.",
        "We really kept the information basic about our lives.",
        "And, well, I wanted to say just quickly that the experience of using the Internet and providing this blog, that was really, I think, essential for our birth mother reaching out to us.",
        "What I did want to say, and just mention this quickly, is I think we still need to have a conversation about the adoption process itself because we spent five weeks waiting for an adoption to happen in another state.",
        "And it was because of legal reasons and just a very complicated and lengthy process.",
        "And with - that part of the process was unfortunate, but I would say that using the Internet and networking with our birth mother that way was a really wonderful process.",
        "But with that, I would say that it was paramount that we had our adoption agency there with us to help guide us and know what was appropriate and not appropriate to put up on a personal website.",
        "I think that guidance is really important for adoptive parents, to protect themselves both legally and, you know, their own personal information.",

        "Is - as - whether that piece of legislation goes through or not, it does seem that there is more - there are more hurdles in the way of international adoptions, which can take a long time and be very complicated.",
        "And does that put even more emphasis on these Internet transactions here?",
        "Well, they're a little bit separate, but the answer is, the direct answer to your question is absolutely.",
        "This is the way people adopt.",
        "I mean, if you go online, most adoptions in America today are from foster care.",
        "So if you go online, you see pictures of kids - and this is some of the positives, right?",
        "This is people able - in Utah able to see a child in Mississippi and say I can give that kid a home, she has special needs, but I can do this."

        "And I just did not feel as safe in using the process for online adoption that my parents had used when they were looking to adopt me in 1985, where they had to, you know, make up their own piece of paper stating this is who I am and go to different agencies and so on and so forth.",
        "And I just felt like it wasn't as personal, that you didn't get this same connection that you had back in the day, where you actually had - you met these people, or you met with certain agencies, and you got the counseling, you got the support, you had different adoption groups that you could be a part of, which I continued to be part of for a long time after we were adopted.",
        "And then even a year later, they ended up adopting my brother because my birth parents ended up getting pregnant again and asked them if they wanted another child.",
