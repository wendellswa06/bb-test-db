        "But Mitchell says even though students know who John Lewis is, he doesn't think Lewis' support for Hillary Clinton will affect how people on campus vote.",

        "Some woman have been calling it, or been more comfortable with the term love addiction.",

        "I then, could tell.",
        "When there were people who were going to set this pattern in motion, I think part of what's really important - couple of things, it seems to me that there's trauma that is part of the origin of this kind of addiction - and I know Kelly can speak to that - that actually alters your brain chemistry, if you don't have a certain kind of attachment happening with your parents.",
        "And in all the groups, in all the readings and everything I've done, I certainly have them in my background, boy, have I heard it from other people, so I think that's an interesting thing factor in, because there does seem to be a neuro-chemical aspect to it.",

        "But then when you talk about crossing the line into vandalism or stalking, is that a part of a cycle of love addiction, or is that just some totally different.",
