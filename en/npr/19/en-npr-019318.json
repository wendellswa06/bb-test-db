        "Kelly, first what does that mean?",
        "What that means is - and Rachel is touching on this - there's a neurochemical element to this disease.",
        "In fact, love and sex addiction in this field is really commonly referred to as a brain disease, because what - what the addict is doing is compensating for low levels of dopamine and serotonin by the hyper arousal that comes from infatuation, from the hunt, from chasing, from flirting, and ultimately from sexual arousal, which is the most powerful neuro-pathway in the brain, other than fear.",
        "But if you mix both of them at the same time, fear and sexual arousal, you create the most powerful neurochemical cocktail the brain can handle.",
        "Which is why at times the system, when it's angry or frightened, sexual arousal is much more intense, which is what we see in relationships that do become abusive.",
        "We call them trauma-bonded, where the trauma that's happening, which is generally replicating something that happened in childhood, is powerfully addictive for the brain.",
        "Did you find yourself in, you know, in a state ever where these two strains of emotion were blended together, Rachel, the fear or anger plus the sexual arousal?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "A heady cocktail for damaged people.",
        "There is one partner I had, I don't know if I could use that term, but a lover I had who gets actually two chapters in this book because it was such - it was another kind of bottom, sometimes you'll hit several bottoms.",
        "And it was a way of entering into this incredibly sordid, also very experimental, really pushing boundaries, and by the way, I'm not anti-sex.",
        "I love sex, I think it's great.",
        "But it's - this is - and it's hard to tweeze this all apart, but for me it was just one pattern of another destructive relationships.",
        "But in this case I felt like through this other person who was a straight-up sex addict, as far as I'm concerned, I entered into that zone and it's a very drugged kind of feeling to be constantly aware that the world is just available on that level.",
        "I want to move on to something that we just touched on, which was celebrities - some of them going in rehab for sex addiction, David Duchovny, who's got this show, perhaps ironically called \"\"Californication,\"\" a great show, but going in for sex addiction.",
        "But other celebrities have talked about their addiction to pornography, and here's gospel singer Kirk Franklin talking about his addiction to porn.",
        "There's always that boy who's got the big brother, who's got the magazines up on his bed, and that's how it starts.",
        "And the first time I ever saw one, I was maybe like about eight or nine when I saw my first magazine and from there, I was addicted.",
        "Kelly, what's the difference between what we're calling love addiction, sex addiction, and then, pornography addiction?",
        "Great question.",
        "And what a wonderful quote you used, because what we find when we're working with people who do come - come to the terms of having this addiction is it did start as young as eight or nine years old, sometimes 11 or 12, sometimes three or four, where a child has come into contact with some - a sexually explicit material that the brain is not yet appropriately developmentally ready to handle.",
        "Which is the problem we're having with the Internet, where kids are being exposed to sexual material way before their brain is ready for that.",
        "It's beyond finding your brother's pornography.",
        "Although, that was generally what it would take.",
        "There's really no difference in the body between porn addition, sex addiction, love addiction.",
        "The body doesn't really care about the difference in the brain, love, sex gets merged.",
        "It's because it's the same hormones.",
        "Culturally however, we have a lot of shame attached to these different forms of addiction.",
        "So people have different access to them.",
        "Now, that the internet brings pornography into every home we're finding more and more women are finding that they're having trouble with their own compulsivity around looking at porn.",
        "Whereas before, they might not have actually had the courage to walk out into an adult bookstore or find a magazine, was not quite as easy as it might have been for boys."

        "As we draw this to a close, Rachel, what helped you?",
        "And what does this help mean for someone like you, who considers yourself a love addict?",
        "What does this recovery mean for someone like you?",
        "Well, there are a couple of points here I just wanted to mention, that this idea of trauma-bonding.",
        "When there is a chemical release, if you have a certain kind of traumatized brain as I understand it, it's bringing you up to a normal level.",
        "So whereas a healthy person experiencing that first blush of love might be feeling great, but for someone who's a love addict, who has that kind of background, if it's a brain disease and we can buy that, you know, it's really just getting you to a kind of - to a normal operating level.",
        "But, what we're all seeking, or certainly what I was endlessly seeking, was some kind of true intimacy and connection, and that's not the route to achieve it.",
        "So that was one of the biggest problems, besides which you spend so much time.",
        "So go - for me going into a 12 step meeting where other people gather who have the same kind of issues was - changed everything because it was - as we're talking about the brain, that perception changed, and also you're bonding with other people.",
        "And Kelly, very quickly, what do you think recovery means in a situation like this?",
        "Well, Rachel's correct.",
        "12 steps support is critical, but the reason for that is this is an addiction, and a person has got to enter a withdrawal period, as you would from any other addiction, which means a period of non-romantic activity.",
        "This does not however mean go into isolation.",
        "Woman do not get healthy in isolation, and you cannot recover from an addiction to romance, and to love without other people, but you need people that are non-romantic.",
        "Preferably same gender, preferably who can help you through this process because they're in it themselves.",
        "You also, need a therapist who understands trauma, who understands this addiction and will not further to shame that you're already feeling as you go through withdrawal.",
        "Withdrawal from this disorder is one of the more painful experiences that addicts will go through.",
        "Well, I had two and a half years of inadvertent abstinence, yeah.",
        "Well, I want to thank you both for sharing your stories.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Thank you so much for having me.",
        "Thanks for having us.",
        "That was Rachel Resnick, the author of \"\"Love Junkie\"\" a memoir about her addiction to love, and Kelly McDaniel, a sex and love addiction specialist.",
        "She also wrote the book \"\"Ready to Heal.\"\" And coming up next on News & Notes, we have got out text segment with Mario Armstrong.",
        "We'll look at companies and websites that lead you be an instant entrepreneur.",
        "Plus Justin Bua is known for his paintings of break dancers and DJs.",
