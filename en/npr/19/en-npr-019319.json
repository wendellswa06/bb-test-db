        "You might as well just get your lights turned off and pay the restoration fee, or you might as well write a bad check and incur bounced check fees which are sometimes up to 1,200 percent in terms of what would be called an APR. It's about giving people options and giving them financial literacy so they can exercise their choice wisely.",
        "Well, Niger, you bring up Ohio.",
        "Keith, I'm going to bring you into this, because in Ohio, there's a law that caps annual interest rates at 28 percent that's going to take effect in September.",
        "Payday lenders are hoping to repeal that law, and there's something called the Ohio Coalition for Responsible Lending that says the average borrower will take almost 13 payday loans a year, people who use payday loans.",
        "So, when Niger talks about financial literacy, that is something that you build up over time.",
        "For people who are already deep in the whole, do you think that it's important to put a cap on the fees?",
        "Or do you think it's OK if the businesses are allowed to charge what they want?",
        "I think, you know, it's OK, and Niger has spoke against the capping of interest rates that the governor just signed in to law in Ohio, and I think it's OK to put a cap on interest rates.",
        "The federal government, last year, passed a 36-percent rate cap on all loans to the military, and I think that is OK.",
        "And if you look at the history of the financial service industry, payday lending started in 1880, and most of the states by 1940 ruled against payday lending and started what they called the small-consumer loan law, which actually had user caps for most of the states, and well, all of the states, actually.",
        "For example, in New York, for example, has a 25-percent cap, Ohio now has a 28-percent, North Carolina has about a 36-percent, Washington, D.C., has a 24-percent.",

        "Jeff Duford is the lead curator.",
        "He's been examining all of this frame by frame.",
        "And the argument that the industry likes to make is the overdraft fee.",
        "For example, we have written against overdraft fee, in fact we called it- our paper addressed how much it would cost for an overdraft.",
        "We think that regulations should be, and if you go back in history, up until 1980 this industry did not exist, and you couldn't charge more than the usual rate.",
        "And what happened, I think that deregulation forced financial institutions in our community - I mean, CRA forced financial institutions in our community - deregulation said, when we go to those communities, take away all the rules, for example.",
        "So, they just eliminated the usual caps in a lot of states.",
        "And that was particularly targeted especially in low-income and minority communities.",
        "Well, Niger, we only have a little bit of time.",
        "As you give us your concluding thoughts, what would you like to see in general for poor communities, for communities of color, in terms of financial access?",
        "I think that's a very good point.",
        "Let me just very quickly, the problem that we have with caps, artificial caps, is that it becomes effectively a ban.",
        "For example, a 36-percent cap translates into a $1.38 of profit, if you will, that a payday lender would make on giving 100-dollar loan.",
        "No one can stay in business and pay the lights and pay staff for a $1.38 for every transaction for unsecured loans.",
        "So, it's - these caps are not caps at all, they're bans.",
        "And I would urge your listeners to read the Federal Reserve Bank Study of New York.",
        "Donald Morgan, a staffer, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, wrote that since payday bans have taken place in Georgia, and Brother Corbett's North Carolina, that the number of bounced check fees have gone up dramatically.",
