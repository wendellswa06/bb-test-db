        "Well, let's talk about Moqtada al-Sadr.",
        "Yesterday, it was reported that a key figure in the parliament aligned with him was killed in a bombing and that Sadr blamed the Americans for that.",
        "How fragile is Sadr ceasefire this days and could that killing spur him to call it off?",
        "Yeah.",
        "The ceasefire is very fragile.",
        "The other interesting question about al-Sadr is, how many of his own forces are former forces that he controlled?",
        "There is a lot of thinking and some of this is reflected in the National Intelligence Estimate that should he call off the ceasefire his former followers won't line up monolithically behind.",
        "And in fact, they could fracture in any number of uncontrollable groups, which is not necessarily a good thing either.",
        "Meanwhile, though, today's front page of the New York Times has a story saying life is a lot better in Baghdad.",
        "It had a picture of some of the blast walls being taken down because it's so much safer now.",
        "There are many, many fewer civilian deaths now than there were a year ago.",
        "What about this improvement in security?",
        "What does NIE say about that?",
        "The NIE says, as does a recent Pentagon report publicly released a couple of weeks ago, that, yes, security has improved.",
        "There is no doubt about that.",
        "I think the figures, the civilians deaths are down 77 percent between June and August 2008 as compared to the same period last year.",
        "American combat deaths are down quite a bit.",
        "The question is whether - is this sustainable?",
        "And whether the surge is actually succeeding in permanently turning a situation around or whether it's been sort of a stop gap.",
        "Frankly, at least one person we've talked to looks at the surge as sort of fixing - meddling their own mess that we created when we first invaded with too few troops.",
        "And so, it doesn't come down on one side or the other of whether or not the surge was a good idea, the NIE?",
        "No, no. It does not.",
        "But it warns about future possible problems.",
        "And one of those is a lack of security.",
        "A security that was put in placed at least partially by U.S.",
        "troops, by the surge.",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "And one other thing it warns about or talks about is, you know, there is now agreement in Iraq for provincial elections in January.",
        "Which is by and large, I think, most people would agree a good thing.",
        "They were supposed to have taken place this month.",
        "But in the past, we've seen elections in Iraq that have actually hardened sectarian lines and created more sectarian tension as opposed to improving things.",
        "The NIE, is we understand it says this provincial elections may do that.",
        "Why won't this report be released until after the election?",
        "That's an excellent question, Madeleine.",
        "To be quite frank with you, it's the one thing we couldn't find out as we try to get our hands on what in this still classified document.",
        "Some people told us that it's just not ready.",
        "But there is lingering suspicion that the White House and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence don't want to put out such an explosive report in the days leading up to the election where whatever they do it will be accused by both sides perhaps as being a political act.",
        "So, and this is well known there is another important report in NIE that I should mention of Afghanistan that is just about complete as well.",
        "That also warns of - even perhaps even more grimly than Iraq.",
        "National Intelligence Estimate it warns that conditions in Afghanistan are spiraling downward."

        "That's the way it sounds right now, but it's interesting that the actual team behind this sponsor is his old manager from the Discovery Channel days where he won seven Tours de France in a row.",

        "With critics questioning the validity of the proceedings that led to Saddam Hussein's execution, we take a few minutes now to revisit the trial.",
        "It was plagued by problems from the beginning, and the fact that it was televised only heightened public scrutiny.",
        "Defendants launched into tirades, three defense attorneys were murdered, and a judge was replaced.",
        "Michael Scharf, a law professor at Case Western Reserve, helped train the tribunal's judges.",
        "Really, everything that could go wrong in this trial did.",
        "It began with the human rights community allied against the tribunal because it had decided to have the death penalty as an available penalty.",
        "Also, they decided not to have an international trial but rather to do it in Iraq.",
        "And finally, there was a lot of countries around the world and human rights organizations that thought it was inappropriate to have a trial after a war that was seen largely as unlawful.",
        "So the tribunal was snake bitten from the beginning.",
        "But the real story is more nuanced.",
        "Throughout all these problems, the prosecution continued to bring witnesses and evidence into court and most of the trial was based on documents.",
        "And at the end of the proceedings, the tribunal issued a 298-page singled-space judgment.",
        "It's the longest ever written judgment in a war crime's trial.",
        "And in that judgment, the judges deal with every single issue raised with the defense.",
        "And most of these are dealt with the first time, unlike U.S.",
        "courts, where pre-trial motions are decided at pre-trial.",
        "They waited until the final judgment to deal with all sorts of weighty issues like the question of whether the judge was too biased to preside over the trial.",
        "And what you get when you read through this very long opinion is a sense that this trial actually did a credible job.",
        "I couldn't find as a law professor and an international law expert any major errors of law.",
        "The legal findings of fact were meticulously done.",
        "So if nothing else, they have written a definitive account of a period of history that needed to be written with credible evidence.",
        "Executing Saddam now means that he will not be held accountable for much greater crimes like the genocide against tens of thousands of Kurds in the Anfal campaign.",
        "Are the Iraqi people now deprived of historical accounting?",
        "This is my biggest disappointment.",
        "That would have required a legislative change because the Iraqi High Tribunal statute has a provision that says that the death penalty, if given, has to be implemented within 30 days after the final appeal.",
        "It wouldn't have been hard to get that legislative change except for the fact that the winds of public opinion had also changed in Iraq.",
        "And I think there was a general feeling that enough was enough.",
        "When you had to balance those two goals, the goal of having the accused face the victims and these other major atrocities versus the goal of just having Saddam Hussein removed from the scene, I think the Iraqi people ended up saying their best chance of peace would be an Iraq without a Saddam Hussein alive in it.",
