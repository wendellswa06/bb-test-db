        "Hello.",
        "Hi, I assume you're calling about the terrible bombing there.",
        "Yes.",
        "When the Murrah Building bombing happened, I was very young, 12 years old, and my mother was a nurse.",
        "And we were downtown helping out as much as we could after that.",
        "And when you asked, you know, what we learned from something like that, I think what's so surprising is that it seems like many of us learn very little.",
        "There was so much media and so much things that happened around that that the problem is, is that it doesn't answer any questions, and it doesn't - you know, you're still left wondering how something like that can possibly happen.",
        "And really I think the only thing you can hope to glean is how to grieve.",
        "How to grieve, and does practice help?",
        "Does practice help with grief?",
        "Yes, and it's - you know, it's one of those things that you think about that for the rest of your life, and you see things and experience things that you can't ever imagine you would have experienced.",
        "But it doesn't - you know, there are so few questions answered, and then even when they are answered, it's never - it's not enough.",
        "It can never possibly be enough to explain a tragedy like that.",
        "There is already talk in Colorado of seeking the death penalty.",
        "Obviously we are a long way from a court case, the first appearance in court today.",
        "But there has been that experience in Oklahoma.",
        "Did that change anything for you?",
        "No, not at all.",
        "I think that it absolutely changed nothing.",
        "You know, we've - for some people I think that that was gratifying I guess.",
        "But I know as far as I'm concerned, there was so much tragedy and so much loss, and more death didn't make that any better.",
        "Sasha, thanks very much for the phone call, we appreciate it.",
        "Thank you."

        "Joining us now is Ed Smith, he worked as an editor at the Denver Post during the Columbine shootings in 1999.",
        "He is now managing editor of State Legislatures magazine, with us by phone from his office in Denver.",
        "Nice of you to be with us today.",
        "Thank you, Neal, nice to be here.",
        "And I wonder, what did you learn from Columbine that seems relevant today?",
        "I think one thing we learned from Columbine was that 13 years later, I'm not sure that the answers we have are any more satisfying than the answers we had on that horrible day in 1999.",
        "You know, I think that there's something about people who would do something of this sort that we never probably get a very satisfying answer.",
        "And I think that maybe we need to look elsewhere, and that's what I wrote an op-ed piece about in Saturday's Denver Post, that maybe the best that we can hope out of something like this is to try to create a more compassionate community, to try to be better to one another.",
        "We're going to be reading excerpts from op-eds, I guess including yours, but some of them will argue for gun control, some against, some for various things and for others.",
        "But I thought you made an interesting point in your op-ed that this is not an occasion really to look at politicians or Washington, D.C., for answers.",
        "Well, I don't think so.",
        "I think that ultimately we have to look to ourselves if we want a better, more humane community.",
        "When I was a boy, and I was delivering newspapers in June of 1968, I saw that - opened one up one morning and saw that Robert Kennedy had been assassinated, and I think I've been waiting ever since then for somehow our society to change so these things don't happen.",
        "I don't think that's - I don't think that's likely, but I think that what is possible is that we as individuals and as communities try to come together and be more decent to each other, be more civil to one another, be more respectful of what other people think.",
        "And maybe that isn't the solution, but I think it probably would make us a better society.",
        "I wanted to read an excerpt from an op-ed by Dave Cullen, who wrote the book on Columbine, and the - he concluded in his article, titled \"\"Don't Jump to Conclusions about the Killer,\"\" that one thing we want to do is wait.",
        "You've probably been bombarded with facts and opinions about James Holmes' motives.",
        "You are probably wrong.",
        "I learned that the hard way.",
        "In 1999 I lived in Denver and was part of the first wave of reporters to descend on Columbine High School the afternoon it was attacked.",
        "I ran with the journalistic pack that created the myths we are still living with."

        "We were trying to answer the burning question of why, and we were trying to answer it way too soon.",

        "Two outcast loners exacted revenge against the jocks for relentlessly bullying them.",
        "Not one bit of that turned out to be true.",
        "But the news media jumped to all those conclusions in the first 24 hours, so they accepted - they are accepted by many people today as fact.",
        "And of course much of his book about Columbine is about what he did learn in the diaries of the two killers.",
        "And in a sense, Ed Smith, I wonder, we want to know more about this person and why he did it, yet there will be those who say wait a minute, you're glorifying this killer.",
        "I'm not sure it's glorifying.",
        "I think it's understandable that people want to understand why this happens.",
        "But when you open a window into madness, I'm not sure that you ever understand it.",
        "I'm not sure that all the explanations of why the killer in Norway a year ago committed that horrible slaughter that 20 years from now we'll really know more about why he did that any more than he simply lost his grasp on what the rest of us consider reality.",

        "Hi, Emily.",
        "Hi, well, I just agree a lot with Sasha, that in these cases we really don't learn things.",
        "I think it's more reminders.",
        "I know when I first heard the news, I just thought immediately about, you know, if my loved ones were connected with it or who I could possibly know who might be affected by this and just really about the fragility of life.",
        "So, his coach, the guy who won for him all these years in the past, he's gone to work for the Kazakhstan team, they've hired him, and so Lance is going to go ride for him.",
        "I feel like there's so many instances where, you know, just to cope, we have to move through life without thinking about death, but these awful events are just such a big reminder that, you know, not to be morose but death is imminent and that we really have to just appreciate every single chance we get and really, you know, let the people we love know and really just tell everyone and do all that we can for others and hope that that can create, you know, a better society, a better world where perhaps we can transcend these things so they won't happen anymore.",

        "News is still coming out, and I haven't really been able to access all of it because I've been traveling.",
        "But as far as I know, no. But there's still been such an outpouring of love from all of my friends and family towards, you know, everyone who was in Aurora that night, and I have tons of friends who went to the ceremonies last night and everyone on Facebook, you know, texting everything, has just been very concerned and very loving for each other.",
        "Emily, thanks very much for the phone call, and we certainly hope all your friends are OK.",
        "Yeah, thank you.",
        "Ed Smith one thing that has changed in the past 12 years since Columbine, the prevalence of social media.",
        "Well, that's absolutely true, and I think any of us who work in the media or work online are just immersed in that.",
        "I'm not enough of an expert to tell you whether that is going to make us a better, more compassionate society, the way the last caller was just saying, but it certainly allows people to be more in touch with one another about it and to maybe feel and connect with people more quickly.",
        "And when you talk about being a more compassionate, other than attending a memorial service in Aurora, Colorado, what are you talking about?",
        "I think I'm talking about trying to make a difference in our individual lives.",
        "Governor Hickenlooper was at the prayer vigil last night, and I thought he made a poignant point, which is that we want to remember these people, and one way that we can remember them, one way that we can make a difference, is simply to be better people.",
        "And we can all interpret that in different ways.",
        "But I think just small acts of kindness, compassion do make a difference.",
        "It makes us a better people.",
        "I said in my column that 30-plus years in the newspaper business, naive is not a word that people would use to describe me, but I think that it's not entirely naive to say that we need to take into our own hands making ourselves a better society and stop blaming other people, stop pointing our finger at others and say they're the problem or they're the ones who are supposed to come up with a solution.",
        "And speaking of history, you went a little bit past Columbine to the pre-Civil War era to look for lessons.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think that we are a nation that has gone through convulsions of vitriol toward one another.",
        "And certainly the pre-Civil War era is a time when that occurred.",
        "And it seems as though in the last 10 years or so, the last 15 years, that the level of discourse in our country has become so polarized.",
        "And the point I make in the piece is that we've begun to not just disagree with people, we've begun to think that how other people think, and if they don't agree with us they're not simply wrong, they're just - they don't really even have a right to exist.",
        "They're the other.",
        "And we - I think that's a bad place to go in this country, and it troubles me a great deal."

        "So I think that the people are looking for someone to blame, and certainly there's plenty of other places to have that discussion, but I think for my purposes, I'm simply suggesting that if we want to have a better society, it's our responsibility to make it a better society.",
