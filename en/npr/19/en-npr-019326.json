        "But anyway, the reason I'm calling is for two reasons is just to say this kind of thing has been happening in our country for a long time.",
        "This - whoever perpetrated that situation was fully armed, set the whole place on fire, you know, killed many police and firemen, which I witnessed.",
        "It was a terrible situation.",
        "The other reason I'm calling is because my primary memory of that situation was that a young couple, who were both medical students at Tulane University, left the safety of their apartment, which was a few blocks around the corner, to come to this horrific scene and see if they could help.",
        "And they did find my brothers and I cowering across the street from this assault on this Howard Johnson's, walking the firemen, climbing the building, being shot, running across the park, being shot, falling, people jumping, flames everywhere.",
        "And this young couple came down to find out what they could do, and they actually brought us to their apartment and took care of us until my parents returned - they were actually house hunting.",
        "We were moving to New Orleans at that time And just took care of us.",
        "And they called the radio station.",

        "They're OK.",
        "There were no cellphones then.",
        "No.",

        "And this is from an editorial in the Los Angeles Times by Paul Whitefield, an op-ed piece.",

        "Indeed, for all the famous grittiness and violence of the \"\"Batman\"\" movies, very few innocents perished onscreen.",
        "In real life, matters are tragically different.",

        "Sometimes people working on the outskirts of the law can protect those of us who live within it.",
        "Sometimes the law itself can prevent evil men from gaining the tools to wreak destruction.",
        "But often, the most important defense of civilization takes place only after tragedy has struck and innocents have perished and the real heroes are neither police nor politicians nor imaginary, bat-suited billionaires but the people whether in Columbine or lower Manhattan or now Aurora, Colorado, who carry one another through the valley of the shadow of death and by their conduct, ensure that the Jokers and James Holmeses of the world win only temporary victories.",

        "This was one of those demonstrations that have been called by Juan Guaido for what he billed as the biggest-ever demonstration in the history of Venezuela.",

        "But I have seen much larger crowds turn out for Guaido before.",
        "And so this was a smaller turnout.",
        "And I think the most noticeable thing about it is that the mood has quite substantially changed.",

        "Yeah.",
        "It's interesting because this team was born out of the ashes of another team called Liberty Sagutos(ph), which was the center of a big doping scandal in Spain in 2006.",
        "Then the team in 2007 had another doping scandal, with two of its star riders kicked out of the Tour de France for blood doping, which is injecting someone else's blood into your system to enhance your performance.",

        "The buzz here in Europe is people were really wondering if Lance can come back to the top levels to what it takes to win a race like the Tour de France.",
        "We're talking three weeks racing, every day 100 percent, that the winning and losing margins come down to percentage points.",
        "The big question is, is he capable of coming back from the three and a half year stop by the time he comes back to the Tour next year.",
