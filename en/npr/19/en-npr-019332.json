        "When there were people who were going to set this pattern in motion, I think part of what's really important - couple of things, it seems to me that there's trauma that is part of the origin of this kind of addiction - and I know Kelly can speak to that - that actually alters your brain chemistry, if you don't have a certain kind of attachment happening with your parents.",
        "And in all the groups, in all the readings and everything I've done, I certainly have them in my background, boy, have I heard it from other people, so I think that's an interesting thing factor in, because there does seem to be a neuro-chemical aspect to it.",
        "So, you were looking to fill in the blanks for things that you felt you didn't get as a child.",
        "Give me a specific of what you felt you didn't get.",

        "Parts of love addiction can become extremely dangerous, especially for women.",

        "I mean it's just fastening, it kind of seems to be breaking out, and I know Kelly feels like it's a particularly fertile time for learning about this.",
        "I'm not sure why it's coming up so much.",
        "But for women, and in my case, definitely the emotional component was crucial.",
        "And I'm sure there's a brew of romance, and what is love, and that that comes into play, but this - she's talking about the chemistry of arousal and the trance like state, there's no question that - that sexual component was braided together.",
        "And when I look back, which I was - I had to do in writing this memoir, I certainly was able to pick out that every single person that I became involved with, that was an enormous component of the relationship.",

        "What that means is - and Rachel is touching on this - there's a neurochemical element to this disease.",
        "In fact, love and sex addiction in this field is really commonly referred to as a brain disease, because what - what the addict is doing is compensating for low levels of dopamine and serotonin by the hyper arousal that comes from infatuation, from the hunt, from chasing, from flirting, and ultimately from sexual arousal, which is the most powerful neuro-pathway in the brain, other than fear.",
        "But if you mix both of them at the same time, fear and sexual arousal, you create the most powerful neurochemical cocktail the brain can handle.",
        "Which is why at times the system, when it's angry or frightened, sexual arousal is much more intense, which is what we see in relationships that do become abusive.",
        "We call them trauma-bonded, where the trauma that's happening, which is generally replicating something that happened in childhood, is powerfully addictive for the brain.",

        "I love sex, I think it's great.",
        "But it's - this is - and it's hard to tweeze this all apart, but for me it was just one pattern of another destructive relationships.",
        "But in this case I felt like through this other person who was a straight-up sex addict, as far as I'm concerned, I entered into that zone and it's a very drugged kind of feeling to be constantly aware that the world is just available on that level.",
        "I want to move on to something that we just touched on, which was celebrities - some of them going in rehab for sex addiction, David Duchovny, who's got this show, perhaps ironically called \"\"Californication,\"\" a great show, but going in for sex addiction.",
        "But other celebrities have talked about their addiction to pornography, and here's gospel singer Kirk Franklin talking about his addiction to porn."
