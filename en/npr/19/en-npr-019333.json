        "There's always that boy who's got the big brother, who's got the magazines up on his bed, and that's how it starts.",
        "And the first time I ever saw one, I was maybe like about eight or nine when I saw my first magazine and from there, I was addicted.",
        "Kelly, what's the difference between what we're calling love addiction, sex addiction, and then, pornography addiction?",
        "Great question.",
        "And what a wonderful quote you used, because what we find when we're working with people who do come - come to the terms of having this addiction is it did start as young as eight or nine years old, sometimes 11 or 12, sometimes three or four, where a child has come into contact with some - a sexually explicit material that the brain is not yet appropriately developmentally ready to handle.",
        "Which is the problem we're having with the Internet, where kids are being exposed to sexual material way before their brain is ready for that.",
        "It's beyond finding your brother's pornography.",
        "Although, that was generally what it would take.",
        "There's really no difference in the body between porn addition, sex addiction, love addiction.",
        "The body doesn't really care about the difference in the brain, love, sex gets merged.",
        "It's because it's the same hormones.",
        "Culturally however, we have a lot of shame attached to these different forms of addiction.",
        "So people have different access to them.",
        "Now, that the internet brings pornography into every home we're finding more and more women are finding that they're having trouble with their own compulsivity around looking at porn.",
        "Whereas before, they might not have actually had the courage to walk out into an adult bookstore or find a magazine, was not quite as easy as it might have been for boys.",
        "As we draw this to a close, Rachel, what helped you?",
        "And what does this help mean for someone like you, who considers yourself a love addict?",
        "What does this recovery mean for someone like you?",
        "Well, there are a couple of points here I just wanted to mention, that this idea of trauma-bonding.",
        "When there is a chemical release, if you have a certain kind of traumatized brain as I understand it, it's bringing you up to a normal level.",
        "So whereas a healthy person experiencing that first blush of love might be feeling great, but for someone who's a love addict, who has that kind of background, if it's a brain disease and we can buy that, you know, it's really just getting you to a kind of - to a normal operating level.",
        "But, what we're all seeking, or certainly what I was endlessly seeking, was some kind of true intimacy and connection, and that's not the route to achieve it.",
        "So that was one of the biggest problems, besides which you spend so much time.",
        "So go - for me going into a 12 step meeting where other people gather who have the same kind of issues was - changed everything because it was - as we're talking about the brain, that perception changed, and also you're bonding with other people.",
        "And Kelly, very quickly, what do you think recovery means in a situation like this?",
        "Well, Rachel's correct.",
        "12 steps support is critical, but the reason for that is this is an addiction, and a person has got to enter a withdrawal period, as you would from any other addiction, which means a period of non-romantic activity.",
        "This does not however mean go into isolation.",
        "Woman do not get healthy in isolation, and you cannot recover from an addiction to romance, and to love without other people, but you need people that are non-romantic.",
        "Preferably same gender, preferably who can help you through this process because they're in it themselves.",
        "You also, need a therapist who understands trauma, who understands this addiction and will not further to shame that you're already feeling as you go through withdrawal.",
        "Withdrawal from this disorder is one of the more painful experiences that addicts will go through.",
        "Well, I had two and a half years of inadvertent abstinence, yeah.",
        "Well, I want to thank you both for sharing your stories.",
        "Appreciate it."

        "He's helped to develop a PTSD therapy he calls Virtual Iraq.",
        "Hi, Skip.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "So the idea of a virtual universe is to simulate reality for the viewer.",
        "And, in this case, does that mean really simulating war?",
        "In order to treat PTSD effectively, we often rely on what's called exposure therapy, and that is to get people to revisit the trauma and to emotionally process those memories and the negative things that happened to them.",
        "As long as you avoid re-processing these memories or re-experiencing them in a therapeutic fashion, they're going to continue to haunt you.",
        "So that is why we go to the trouble and expense to create a virtual Iraq environment in which the person can ever so gradually re-experience what they went through in Iraq, but in a safe, supportive environment in the clinician's office."

        "So we put a pair of headsets on a person, and they're also sitting on a base-shaker platform, so they actually can feel vibration.",
        "We also have a smell machine that pumps smells into the space that are relevant for what the person is going to experience.",

        "We record all of these physiological measures of stress, as well as they're in full audio contact with the patient.",
        "The idea here is that you put a person in the environment at a level that they can handle with only a little bit of anxiety, and that eventually, that anxiety distinguishes or habituates, i.e., the person gets used to the environment, and then they're able to take on a little bit more.",
