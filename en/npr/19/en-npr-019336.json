        "So that's the issue for us.",
        "Senegal has signed since 1960 because written in our constitution since 1958 that we are ready to abandon partially or totally our sovereignty to join the unity government in Africa.",
        "So we have no problem.",

        "Now, Senegal's foreign minister, Mr. Cheikh Tidiane Gadio, also said that if it comes to past that not all the African leaders decide at this summit that they want one continental government, he envisages his country, Senegal, and maybe three, four, five others forging ahead and taking the lead to create this continental pan-African government and to allow the others to catch up later.",
        "He also added that there's not one country in Africa that has the power to stop Senegal doing it, if it so wishes.",

        "And I don't want to, you know, over - go beyond that data, but I think that's rather encouraging, considering that these were active-duty participants that had just gotten back, had tried other forms of treatment without any success.",
        "So, you know, we're feeling that we're on the right track, but we still have quite a bit more work to do in order to, you know, really validate that this is a successful treatment.",
        "But one thing to keep in mind is that the VR is a tool to deliver exposure therapy.",
        "And thus far, exposure therapy has been supported as the best-validated treatment procedure for PTSD of all forms of treatment.",
        "This was documented by the National Academy of Science last fall and in other sources, as well.",
        "So what we're doing is we're able to do this exposure therapy, but in a much more controlled and a much more provocative fashion.",
        "So I think we're resting on good ground, that we're operating from good theoretical principles and accepted treatment practices.",
