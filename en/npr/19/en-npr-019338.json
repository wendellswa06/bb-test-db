        "Still, I got to give it up to Pat.",
        "I mean, the guy really does love black music and he was willing to record classic R&B with the very artist who made the music.",

        "It's also got to be heard in any possible future unity government.",
        "Here is what he said.",
        "The African Union is a major political step toward emancipation.",
        "And human rights is the key to ending conflict - the conflict in Darfur, Somalia, Zimbabwe.",
        "The union must have the strength to resolve conflict without foreign intervention.",
        "Today is a great moment in Africa and world history.",
        "He also said, Farai, that Africa's moral authority would be determined, would be judged, by how it dealt with the conflict and crises on the continent.",
        "And of course, in the ordinary Africans: some pros; some against; some think it's a Utopian dream; some think it must happen now; some think don't trust the African leaders, look what they've done for us in the past - virtually nothing."
