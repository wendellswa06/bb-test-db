        "We have - when we look at our trend, we were under 20 percent free and reduced-price lunch count in '02, '03, and if you fast-forward to about six years later, we were up to 29 percent.",
        "And right now, Roseville area schools has 44 percent of the students on free and reduced-price lunch.",
        "So it's a really steady and consistent uphill climb toward that.",
        "About three percent more kids each year, two to three percent is what we see.",
        "Do kids know that they're on the free lunch program?",
        "It will depend on the family circumstances.",
        "I suspect most of the time they do.",
        "And do other kids know that kids are on the free lunch program?",
        "Hopefully not, but again it'll depend on circumstances.",
        "It's not through the district sharing the news, of course, but it depends on kid conversations with each other.",
        "And so there's no tipoff when you're standing in the cafeteria line?",
        "Right.",
        "Kids don't exchange money or anything anyway.",
        "They all go through the line and enter a number.",
        "Everybody enters a number.",
        "So there's no tipoff that way to the really best we can manage that.",
        "This is - there's usually a relationship between poor kids and academic performance.",
        "Is that slipping in conjunction with the poverty rates?",
        "We try really hard to avert that correlation, of course, but it's there.",
        "We know it is and has been for a long time in the research.",
        "But we work really hard to avert that.",
        "We get some special resources that help in the form of Title I dollars from the federal government and in the form of compensatory ed dollars from the state of Minnesota.",
        "So we are able to do more in those pockets where the poverty is greatest."
