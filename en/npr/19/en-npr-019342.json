        "So, you know, my mother would try to hide the fact that it was powdered milk by putting it in a real milk carton, you know, but, you know, we knew different.",

        "He lived on food stamps for most of his life until he was 12 or 14.",
        "So for us, it wasn't - we grew up with it.",
        "We knew - we know that there's a way out of it, and it just so happens that right now economically, so many people overstretched themselves for so many years thinking that the bubble was never going to pop, that there was always going to be food in the pantry, and now there's not.",
        "So you just have to learn to make concessions.",
        "I think...",
        "Angela, I'm just going to say we wish you the best of luck.",
        "It sounds like you're doing well, and I hope your husband can find a job in St. Louis.",
        "Well, I'm hoping his company can transfer him back to St. Louis.",
        "He's got a good job, and the last thing we want to do is see it go away.",
        "But the company just announced another layoff of another 37 people.",
        "Ouch.",
        "So yeah, so we're kind of sitting on the fence again.",
        "Well, good luck.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Yes, I realized that - well, my kids found out that we were kind of being pushed out when I - I mean, I work full-time, but I started not being able to have money to pay for their lunch.",
        "But I make too much to qualify for any reduced or - food.",

        "I was getting by for a while because I knew I couldn't afford the coats, but it came around cold.",
        "So I was like oh gosh, I've got to figure out how we're going to do that.",
        "How are you going to do it?",
        "Well, my son used a coat from a cousin, and the two, the two girls kind of decided - teenagers kind of like to be cute anyway, but they decided they didn't need a coat.",
        "I think they just didn't want to bother me to try to get it.",

        "Well, my two older, my 19- and 17-year-old, didn't - have not been doing well with it because it's more of appearance with teenagers, and the 19-year-old, but he did find a job, but he's in college, but he had to get because I was paying for it.",
        "We didn't qualify for any aid.",
        "So he did find a job recently.",

        "The kids in that situation, obviously you don't know these individuals, but kids in situations like that, this can leave scars.",
        "Absolutely, and again it just is telling how she mentioned that her oldest children are having more difficulty being able to cope with it really because it's a change in what they may have known previously.",

        "Every individual story is different, but is it more positive, do you think, for a parent to sit down with a kid and explain, age-appropriate obviously, or that kids realize it when there's no winter coat or no money for school lunch.",
        "Well, it's always good to prepare your children for what's happening.",
        "We even say if there's a death in the family and a child has never gone to a funeral, you want to talk to them about what they are going to see and what the experience will be like so then they have some sort of way to touch base with what you've stated and what they're experiencing.",
