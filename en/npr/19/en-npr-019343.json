        "And what is the best way to approach those kids in their new situation?",
        "Clearly their parents have an obligation to explain them to it, but what about the schools?",
        "Well, I think that there are a couple of things that can take place, and I'm going to speak to it particularly from an early childhood perspective because this is a period that's really critical for children's development and their later school success.",
        "So there's actually a good amount of research that shows that mental health consultation, which is when a mental health expert who has expertise around children zero to six years of age actually provides support to teachers, to social workers, to health professionals that may not be knowledgeable about children's mental health.",
        "But this individual that provides the mental health consultation, that really can help to improve children's development, their social and emotional function, their - and also their learning outcome, social and emotional function is related to learning outcomes.",
        "So that's one of the really important things that can take place in early childhood programs in schools.",

        "Well, in early childhood programs, they are available some of the time.",
        "I mean, part of the issue is funding, but there are some programs, for example Head Start programming, oftentimes they rely on mental health consultation, and there are other programs, early childhood programs, that when the funding is there, that's something that they can do.",
        "But it actually can be done with very limited resources.",
        "I did some work in upstate New York with a community-based coalition that worked on early childhood initiatives.",
        "And what this group was really interested in doing was holding a monthly meeting or every other month, having this early childhood mental health consultant come in, and to talk to the members of their coalition, and then also to - they would invite other stakeholders to attend the meeting.",
        "And so if it's done in that manner, it's very cost-effective.",

        "And are you seeing a surge in the necessity for these services?",
        "I would say that it's always been somewhat high, but there have been, in terms - I haven't got data that actually say that there's a surge, but I can speak to it anecdotally.",
        "And there have been some increases, as families are experiencing more economic hardship.",
        "Parents are more stressed out.",
        "So that affects their relationship.",

        "And that manifests itself in different ways in the classroom, so you may see children acting out more and having problems in the classroom.",

        "And when she's talking about those people going into that situation - that's you she was talking about, right?",
        "It is, actually.",
        "Many times, I do go into children's classrooms to be able to provide consultation services.",
        "For five years, I actually worked for the District of Columbia Public Schools doing that exact thing, and also worked hand in hand with Head Start in being able to provide consultation services as well as being able to provide psychological testing for children who were at risk of being identified with learning disabilities and emotional disturbance."
