        "Well, I have mixed feelings about late Salinger.",
        "I find the stories about Seymour, the supposed saint who committed suicide, of the Glass family, the older brother of the Glass family - I find Salinger sort of driven more and more to write less and less convincingly about why Seymour is a saint, throwing in lots of Buddhist and Eastern mysticism but not necessarily impressing me that this guy was a saint.",
        "And I think that Holden - that \"\"The Catcher in the Rye\"\" is underrated because people misread it, because people read it only as if it reflects the point of view of Holden Caulfield and therefore is naive and over-romantic and purist and looks down upon the world, where I think that Salinger is actually creating a character who is like that, and doing so with great fidelity.",
        "And maybe we learn something from the lesson of what it - where you end up if you reject the world for slight impurities or reject people for slight impurities."
