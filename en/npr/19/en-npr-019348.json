        "Dr.",

        "When an ambulance picks up a patient or several patients at a disaster, they're out of service for the rest of their area, whatever area they serve.",
        "And if you can consider someone being picked up as deceased, that ambulance conceivably is out of service for the living in that area.",
        "And unless they have special arrangements for coverage, you know, you wonder whether this is going to be taking care of the deceased-versus-the-living situation, and that becomes a huge ethical dilemma.",
        "And there's another situation, let me put it to you.",
        "A mass-casualty incident, a bus crash, a train wreck, that sort of thing, lots of injured people who need help.",
        "Yet also, sadly, lots of otherwise healthy people who got killed and whose organs might be very good for transplant.",
        "Dr.",

        "And there were different camps in the campaign - one camp which thought the leadership was not spending the money wisely and also not letting McCain be McCain.",
        "And as far as my reporting tells me, that was kind of the senator's view as well.",
        "He was upset with where he'd gotten to and wanted to kind of shake things up and try and get out back on the stump, where he can meet voters face to face and kind of recapture perhaps some of that energy from his first presidential campaign.",

        "He wasn't doing that well with social conservatives anyway on those social issues.",
        "The bet he's making is that social conservatives will pick him for other reasons - for the rest of his resume, and so this is a problem.",
        "Certainly Giuliani doesn't want to be talking about Vitter.",
        "But if he's going to win over the hearts and minds of social conservatives, it's going to be on those other issues, not by having an envoy like Vitter try to explain Giuliani to that constituency."
