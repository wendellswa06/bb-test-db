        "Well, there has not been a head-to-head prospective study published yet of comparing the two methods of CPR.",

        "Because I'm reading in an article here from \"\"The Lancet,\"\" which concludes that standard cardiac-only resuscitation is equivalent or superior to conventional bystander CPR in adult patients.",
        "Well, in that study - in the overall study with tests that they - that the researchers applied, there was no difference in survival with compression-only versus conventional CPR.",
        "The superiority was only found in what we refer to as a post-hoc analysis, so it was after the fact trying to tease out if there was a difference in a sub-group of patients.",

        "In addition, there have been a couple studies published since that study in Japan that have shown equivalent.",

        "So we know that they have not been compared head-to-head yet.",
        "There's not been a study published.",

        "You say, there was that overhaul in 2005.",
        "Why newer guidelines now just a few years later?",
        "Well, these guidelines were published for a couple of reasons: One, we knew that, still, less than 30 percent of victims of cardiac arrest were receiving any form of bystander CPR.",
        "We know CPR works and can double or triple survival from cardiac arrest and yet bystanders were hesitating to act.",
        "When actual bystanders were questioned on why they didn't act, the most common reason was that they were afraid of doing something wrong.",
        "So we felt that we really had to reassure bystanders that doing something was better than doing nothing.",
        "And then, there were a couple of studies published that showed that against a historic control, compression-only CPR produced equivalent survival to conventional CPR.",
        "So the science advisory was issued for bystander CPR for adults who collapse suddenly."

        "So, that's…",
        "Just as important though is, even when we are able to get an advanced airway in, it's part of our big push or what we're really trying to do is decreasing the severity and frequency of respiration once that airway is made, because we're really finding that it's decreasing the refill on the heart.",
        "And we're losing ground every time somebody pushes real hard and takes up space in that chest.",
