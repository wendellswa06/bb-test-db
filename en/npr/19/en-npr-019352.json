        "He's expressed reluctance to take tough action, though Congress is nudging him in that direction.",

        "Most all U.S.",
        "presidents pursue a two-track policy with Russia - confrontation on some fronts, cooperation on others.",

        "James Dobbins worked on Russia issues at the State Department for decades and is now with the RAND Corporation.",
        "We need a policy that confronts them where we need to and cooperates with them where we can.",
        "Yet, according to Dobbins and others, Trump has not moved decisively in either direction.",
        "The Russia investigation makes it difficult, if not impossible, for Trump to launch any big joint ventures, and he's resisted taking tough actions despite Russian interference in last year's election.",
        "Longtime Russia hands point to several things Trump should do to address the downward spiral in relations.",
        "First, choose your battles carefully.",
        "We must work together in areas where we have common interests that are fairly narrowly defined.",
        "Georgetown professor Angela Stent has met Russian leader Vladimir Putin every year for the past 13 years as part of a small group of American experts on Russia.",
        "She's set to see him again in October.",
        "She urges engagement with Russia on several key fronts, including cyberattacks.",
        "The cyber area, for instance, is one where we have to try and sit down with the Russians and talk about rules of the road.",
        "On other issues, like Russia's military involvement in Ukraine, she's pessimistic."

        "You have to have realistic expectations about where cooperation is possible.",
        "We may have a common interest that we would like to see the situation resolved, but I think we have rather different ideas about what a satisfactory resolution of that crisis would be.",
        "A second important goal is restoring stability to this multifaceted relationship.",

        "and Russia have agreed to a ceasefire in the southwest corner of Syria, though it's only a small part of a much larger conflict.",
        "On the other hand, Townsend says, Russia is trying to intimidate NATO members in Eastern Europe, and this includes a major military exercise planned for next month.",
        "And so we, the United States as well as NATO, have put troops up in the Baltics and in Poland to deter the Russians up there.",
