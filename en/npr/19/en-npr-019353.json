        "So they weren't aware of any of this going on.",

        "Arthur Caplan, that's sort of outside the structure that we were talking about in terms of emergency rooms and ambulances, but nevertheless the same kinds of ethical conflicts.",
        "Same kinds of ethical conflicts.",
        "So the moral principle in America is operated by trying to help those who need organs for transplant is that you have to be announced dead by people independent from those who come to get the organs and you don't want to cross what's called the dead-donor rule, or if you rule the dead donor alive.",
        "People shouldn't be present from organ procurement until somebody is pronounced dead.",
        "One of the difficulties from the ambulance situation is the people who are going to have to do the pronouncing now, out in the field of death, are probably the people that are going to involved in taking the human body back for purposes of procurement.",
        "So the line gets blurry.",
        "That's why I'm much more comfortable if this system was set up to say, we're only going to start with people who have a donor card where we find it, or we're going to ask people, survivors or family members, if they think the person might have wanted to be an organ donor.",

        "In fact, if you go to one of the websites where you can become a donor, organdonor.gov, it will say you should tell your family what your wishes are, fill out one of these cards, and in many states, the family will have to sign some sort of permission slip to allow procurement of organs.",
        "It is obviously preferable for the family to be involved in the decision and to know fully what's going with their deceased person or their nearly deceased person.",
        "And I can really feel for that physician who had to make the call on brain death, because sometimes the call is not that easy to make.",
