        "Well, we expect - we hope that if we can get twice as many people to - bystanders to do CPR, we can get twice as many victims to have bystander CPR, we think we can save tens of thousands of lives.",

        "What's even better for Barack Obama is the fact that he has gotten his money from as many as over 100,000 different donors, which means that he has gotten a lot of small contributions, which means that these same folks can come back and give him another contribution, and which means that he has a good chance to raise $100 million in 2007.",

        "I'm a Republican, of course, and everybody knows that.",
