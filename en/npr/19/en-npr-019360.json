        "It got good - good notices, not so good notices, but the audiences were wonderful.",
        "It was - both nights we did post-performance discussions, something that I like, where we have my whole group of about, oh, I guess 25 individuals, from the composers to the dancers to Janet, my associate director and Bjorn Amelan, my creative director, all on stage talking about this thing that we've done.",

        "But don't ever forget that this man is responsible for unspeakable murder, torture and violence throughout Mexico and beyond and despite some of his glorification in the press.",
        "But the best part about Chapo to talk about is his notorious great escapes, and he made two - the latest in the summer of 2015.",
        "That was the most daring and amazing.",
        "It was through a tunnel that began in his prison cell shower, dropped down to a tunnel that ran a mile long.",
        "He jumped on a modified motorcycle and went through that mile-long tunnel and out to freedom.",

        "But I can tell you what some of the speculations were is what - that the Mexicans wanted to give him over to the United States while President Obama was still in power, not to President Trump today, but also maybe that this was a signal to President Trump that they are ready to negotiate, and this was their prize to him on his first day in office.",

        "You see, Orozco says he's gay, and homosexuality is against the law in Nicaragua.",
        "But Canadian officials turned down his request for asylum because they weren't convince that Orozco is gay."

        "Then, he made it to the United States illegally and he was caught and was supposed to be deported, but he ended up staying with a Christian family there as well.",

        "On what basis then did Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board conclude that he's not gay?",
        "Well, he filed a refugee claim and then there was a hearing that took place in which there was one member of the Immigration and Refugee Board there.",
        "And it was hearing by videoconference and that person decided that he just didn't prove that he was gay.",

        "It seems odd for all of us to think how do you prove that.",
        "Speaking to his lawyer now, tells me it's things like, for example, if you're trying to plead refugee status on the basis of your religion, you show your - if there's some, sort of, card, if you have pictures, pictures from meeting with a group -well, he says that it's the same if you're trying to put it on the basis of your sexual orientation.",
        "So, for example, he could have shown pictures if he went to the gay pride parade here in Toronto, for example, or apparently at the time, he had an Internet profile on some gay Web sites that could have been provided.",
        "Different things like that.",
        "At the time, however, he had a different lawyer who never gave any of that information."
