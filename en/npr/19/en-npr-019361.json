        "No, no.",
        "Still, I wondered if Walter had any regrets, like did he ever wake up in the middle of the night and think, `Maybe that capon was a little dry.",

        "Like did he find a Post-it note on his whisk saying, `Pack up your pots and pans and get out'?",
        "There's an individual who's the chief usher of the White House, which is basically the day-to-day general manager, if you will, who asked me to come to his office and said that the first lady decided that she was wanting to make a change, to go a different direction.",
        "You know, I was happy that we made her happy for four years and took care of the Clintons for nearly seven years.",
        "It was a great honor to do it, and whomever gets in there next is going to have a great honor also.",
        "Chef Walter Scheib is currently writing a book about his White House experience.",
        "He also wrote a recipe for those who have recently been involuntarily separated from their jobs.",
        "It's called seared scallops with red curry and gingered vegetable ribbons in the manner of an old friend.",

        "So we know that it's technically possible to protect our city to make our area survivable.",
