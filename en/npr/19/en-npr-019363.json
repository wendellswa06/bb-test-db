        "The, you know, vast amount of scholarly material and media representations cover every possible angle, or so it would seem.",
        "What do you think there was to add to that body?",
        "I don't think I was setting out to add.",
        "I was actually setting out to investigate something which is - I wanted to say.",
        "It's very important that your listeners understand that this work was as much about Lincoln as it was about making art because we realize that I am a formalist.",
        "I am a person that comes from a generation that taught us the greatest thing that you can give to an audience is an awareness of their perceiving mechanism.",
        "Therefore, this piece was about how we get information, what a dance phrase is, what a song that has a certain emotion, like \"\"Glory, Glory Hallelujah,\"\" how that song can, over the course of 90 minutes, morph because of who is on stage dancing, because of the lighting, because of the way people move.",
        "Yes, it was about Mr. Lincoln, but there isn't a devil of a lot that I can add to Mr. Lincoln other than something about seeing Mr. Lincoln through the mechanism, the flesh and bones, of this very contemporary art ensemble and the aesthetic that is mine, my associate director Janet Wong(ph) and all the people working."

        "I love very much Lincoln's sense of humor, which was really hard to get at.",
        "We have a little bit of slapstick, and I think it's pretty funny, where the singer, Clarissa(ph), is on the phone, and she's refusing to listen to Lincoln and listen to what her collaborators are doing, and there's this whole argument about her liberty, her freedom, to speak on the phone when she wants to, which is sort of trying to mimic the kind of folksy, down-home, disarming way that Mr. Lincoln was able to get across very complex ideas.",
        "Do you know that story about the shepherd and the sheep and the wolf?",
        "That's in the center of a piece, and I won't pretend to do Mr. Lincoln's language, but he's saying something to the effect that the sheep is grateful to the shepherd for keeping the wolf from its throat.",
        "The sheep thinks the shepherd has supported his liberty, while the wolf thinks the shepherd has thwarted his sense of liberty, and Lincoln, in his very kind of acerbic, dry way, obviously these two disagree about what liberty really is.",

        "I read Carl Sandburg, \"\"The Prairie Years and the War Years,\"\" back when I was in high school, and I think that's the definitive, so far anyway, that I have read on Lincoln, and what stood out in my studies was Lincoln's humor.",
        "Even though he was a melancholy man and a very melancholy time in our history, he was able to use humor to kind of ease the burden, I think, of what he was going through.",
        "That's very interesting.",
        "And it's very interesting that Mr. Jones was just mentioning that."

        "Yeah, and I also realize that he did not set out to free the slaves.",
        "I mean, it was an economic decision, the Civil War, but the fact that he even considered doing it, I mean, I thought, you know, a lot of people in his situation would have taken the economic tact and just forgotten about those half-human Africans, you know what I mean?",
        "But it makes him very human, though, doesn't it?",
        "He's disarming.",

        "I'm just a plain guy, you know.",
        "Well, he was the real deal, but now it's almost become an affectation, that you have to be just a guy you want to go have a beer with.",

        "He labored with his body.",
        "He did what any modern person would probably consider arduous and even degrading labor.",

        "Whoa.",
        "Who is this?",
        "A philosopher-critic, I suspect, right?",
        "Well, dance - that's just the question.",
        "Is dance an elite activity for beautiful, young bodies, or is it a democratized endeavor that anybody is allowed to do?",
        "These are questions that we have been wrestling with for at least the last 100 years of modern dance, and the verdict is still out.",
        "Right now, I think we're in a very conservative period where dance is something, as you would see on television, people doing competition and doing sexy, sultry moves together, and/or is dance something that is done only in marginalized corners of the culture and is almost related to, like, taking cod liver oil, something that you know is good for you, but you sure don't like to take it.",
        "That's a very astute observation.",
        "For us, we would like to have it be a picture of a community of people who yes, they do sweat and struggle together, but you get the sense that they are putting their disparate selves at the service of some kind of vision.",
        "Is it about beauty?",
        "Is it about a view of the social contract that we would like to have as opposed to having?",
