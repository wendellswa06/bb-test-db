        "Merce Cunningham, who just died recently, was known to say, dance can't be abstract because bodies are not abstract and dance is based on bodies.",
        "So these were incredibly thoughtful men.",
        "Oh, no, no. There are thoughts -conceptually, there are thoughts.",
        "I think what I was trying to say in that is that there's an assumption sometime is that dance is the thing which few - a couple of your callers back was sort of trying to poke us that.",
        "It is the thing that is an anesthetized event which unfortunately oftentimes is for an elite.",
        "I think Michelle Obama when she spoke at American Ballet Theater shortly after the inauguration was trying to say something about making the dance more available to all people.",
        "Yes, that is one of its goals, but I think the dance has something - if you think about the body as a site of all knowledge, and the body is a terrifying thing.",
        "Now, can you embrace that what is beautiful in the body and what is terrifying in the body?",
        "The body is prey to all the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, one of them being gravity and another one being old age.",
        "So, dance is actually something that we have to approach with much more respect in the sense of what can it do, what can it say about our condition?",
        "And one way I like to do that is to meet with that other most tangible intangible which is language and the fact that you and I both say liberty but we mean different things or blue and we both mean different things or red and we both mean different things.",
        "How can that language against a field of dancers be brought forward and our attitudes being expressed?",
        "I know we're short of time."

        "Well, I think multiculturalism is basically a political accommodation of minority groups such that people come to enjoy civic equality without a presumption of cultural assimilation.",
        "So if we wanted a contrast with another kind of equality, I think it would be fair to contrast it, say, with the civil rights movement of the US as led by Martin Luther King Jr., where there was an understanding that, oh, well, we're all the same under the different color of skins that we have, and all we want to do--all black people want to do is to join the existing American mainstream, the white mainstream.",
        "Whereas multiculturalism recognizes that there are genuine differences between groups of people--they are ethnic, cultural, historical, religious and so on--and that these differences represent histories and heritages that people can be proud of if they're given the opportunity.",
        "And how did this line of thinking develop historically over the past generation?",
        "Well, in many ways, the politics of it actually arises through the social movements, the new social movements of the 1960s, that emphasized identities, identities like black, you know, black pride, black power, black is beautiful, feminist movements that emphasized female identities, gay pride movements and so on.",
        "So instead of flattening out difference, we need to respect and welcome difference and, indeed, give it some kind of public prominence.",

        "There is a general philosophical principle in France that they refer to as (French spoken), their understanding of secularism, of the separation of state and religion.",

        "We see this as part of the natural diversity of society.",
