        "Haarlem\"\" is the story of an African-American man who goes off to the Netherlands in search of a mother whom he has no memory of ever having seen but he's troubled with something else.",
        "The fact is that he's a recovering alcoholic and he finds most things that many of us take for granted very challenging to his sobriety.",
        "So \"\"Haarlem\"\" is a tale of a lost family recovering itself and, of course, it's a tale across two continents, bringing Harlem together with Haarlem.",
        "Often, when you see writers, particularly their first few books, they tend to write about the places, perhaps, they're from, or a favorite vacation spot, and they stay to that.",
        "You, in fact, have been, through your writings, all over the globe.",
        "Does that speak to who you are?",
        "I think it speaks to who all of us are.",
        "I am very lucky in that I have traveled a great deal and I count travel as being very high on my list of priorities in life.",
        "But more than that, as I travel, I really have a look around, and I'm always thinking about how people live, how people think, what's different from the way that we are brought up here in the United States, and, then again, what's the same.",
        "And I find that so many of the problems we face dealing with issues of social inequality, racism, sexism, all of those things are prevalent all over the world.",
        "So as I write I think I try to reflect many of our own real-life issues through the lens of the way other cultures look at them.",
        "All right, now let me tell on myself, and I hate to admit this, but often I am the ugly American.",
        "What has saved you from that?",
        "Well, you know, it's very ironic.",
        "But as an African-American woman, I travel incognito, and this is what's so funny about it.",
        "When you travel overseas, no one perceives a black woman on the streets as being American.",
        "They see you and they think, `Well, she's from the Caribbean, she may be from some part of north Africa,' and often people are very surprised when I open my mouth and say, `Well, I'm from Detroit.",
        "So I have passed some ways imperceived as I go along cultures, and I think the other thing is, when you've grown up in America, in my generation, which is the generation of the civil rights movement and the black power movement, you come to really think of the world in terms of social inequality.",
        "As you travel, you're always looking for how issues of race, how issue of poverty and privilege are handled.",
        "So that when you go out into that world, what fascinates and excites you is the way that these cultures are dealing with exactly these things.",
        "Why the Netherlands?",
        "Was it, in fact, because Haarlem was there and there was the unique name connection, or was there another reason that you picked the Netherlands?",
        "The Nether--you know, Amsterdam is an amazing city.",
        "Like New York, it's a city within many cities.",
        "And when I traveled in Amsterdam, I was surprised to discover this city of Haarlem just a few minutes away, and Haarlem is so different in character from Amsterdam, and I think that when I traveled in America, in the Harlem, I was struck by, again, how Harlem and New York is a city within a city with its own life and world in the same way that Haarlem in the Netherlands is just outside of Amsterdam.",
        "It's so very different from Amsterdam.",
        "And in writing the book, they paralleled each other.",
        "It just made sense to have this character, Abel Crofton, who lived in Harlem, America, but finds his soul in Haarlem in the Netherlands.",
        "When I think about some of the things that you've talked about through the years, the sexual identity, racial identity, sibling rivalry, all the things that often we don't like to admit to in public, why do this?",
        "You know, that in itself is a--you're asking me personally why I write about these things.",
        "I think that as an author I sometimes see entirely too much passivity, entirely too much of a willingness and a reasonableness and a willingness to accept the way things are in today's generation.",
        "And I think, as an author, I'm constantly feeling a need to somehow discuss the fact that we're wondering.",
        "What did you like most about Abel as you finished him?"

        "I think so many men try so hard to project an outward shell that's impenetrable.",
        "And I choose to believe as a woman--I choose to believe that beneath that shell is a real human being and that if we invest in that human being, we can find it and, man, can we really nurture and make that man, you know, come into his own.",
        "So I love Abel for being willing to take the risks, and I think by the end of the novel he has taken the greatest risk of all, which is the risk to dedicate himself to love.",
        "Well, Heather Neff, it's wonderful talking to you, fellow Detroiter, and one of the things that is, I think, unique about many of your characters is the layers that you do give to them.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And it's always nice to try to figure out, as often those who read novels do, the further back stories that they like to build in their minds, and you give a great launching pad for them.",
