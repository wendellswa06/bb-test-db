        "The anti-war group is much better organized and very obviously, with the elections last fall, especially in the House, a lot of those sort of folks were getting elected, the veterans themselves.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And, well, both parties, I think, were looking for Iraq veterans and Afghanistan veterans to run in this past election cycle, and given the roles they gave them in the debate, those who were successful in the debate in the House of Representatives, you could see the attraction.",

        "But what is disturbing to me is that these people who went and are now speaking out against the war are taking on a really angry sort of tone, led by people like James Webb, who is, of course, a Marine Corps hero - to my generation at least.",

        "Col.",
        "COERR: Right, and he's one of our heroes and always has been, but he's so angry, and he's so anti-administration, and he's so anti-this-war that I think the good points those folks have sometimes gets lost in sort of the background noise.",

        "Lt.",
        "Col.",
        "COERR: Well, I think the discussion needs to be: What is it that we as a country are all about?",

        "All these people, of course, are volunteers.",
        "That seems obvious, but people kind of forget that in the sort of greater cacophony of the media, and all these people knew what they were getting into when they signed up.",
        "I myself do a lot of work down at the Marine Corps recruit depots right here in San Diego, and I see these young kids, fresh out of high school, getting ready to go.",
        "And the drill instructors are making no pretense about where these kids are all going.",
        "They understand it, and the fact that re-enlistment rates are above quota for the Army and the Marine Corps among people who are there in Iraq I think is instructive as to what these people really believe.",

        "That should be obvious to everybody.",
