        "It called for engaging all the regional partners in the area.",

        "And in looking to send a message to the president, not that we need to leave Iraq tomorrow, but that we need something that gives us political consensus in this country.",
        "Because without political consensus, we're going to have a hard time maintaining support for the war.",
        "And, you know, what we're trying to say is to get that message to the president: This strategy's not working.",
        "And that adding 20,000 more troops is basically stay the course more.",
        "It's rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, but the Titanic's still headed to the iceberg.",
        "And we want to see a strategy shift.",
        "And that coalition is not about being for it or against it.",
        "It's about opposing the president's strategy that we have right now, because we need a bipartisan consensus or we're going to have disaster.",
        "And we cannot let this come down to, you know, cutting the money off or staying the course.",
        "These are false debates.",

        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "If we want to have the same ratio of troops in Iraq that we had in Bosnia, which was one for every 50, then we would have to have 320,000 troops on the ground - which, by the way, is not what we had even in the first Gulf War when we had 380,000 troops on the ground, not including forces from the coalition.",

        "And, you know, this administration, their policy has been the high-end weapon systems, not an increase in the size of the army.",
        "It took six years for this president to grow the size of the force.",
        "And prior to the invasion, you know, they canceled the deployment order of cavalry division out of Fort Hood, Texas.",
        "So we went in what we called light, with about 120,000 troops.",
        "And that just wasn't enough to stabilize the country.",

        "You know, the third infantry division's on its third tour in Iraq, so 90 percent of our army's allocated to Iraq.",
        "So, unfortunately, we don't have an army that's large enough to send that many troops into that country for, you know, with a rotational basis.",
