        "Well, first of all, I like to say, welcome home from Vietnam.",
        "That's about 40 years late.",

        "Some of the members of the council are asking why do we deem to do this now?",
        "And we've got a very good answer for that, and that is that we do not have confidence that Iran's program is exclusively for peaceful purposes and until we are confident, we don't want Iran to develop the most sensitive nuclear technologies.",
        "The draft sanctions resolutions now circulating is not a dramatic departure from two previous security council resolutions.",
        "Ambassador Sawers says more Iranian individuals and companies will face travel bands and asset freezes.",
        "And it's also empowering member states to search Iranian planes and ships that call at their airports and ports, if there is a reason to suspect they might be carrying proliferation-sensitive activity.",
        "Now these are measures which have been issues before, in the context for example of North Korea, and they have had an effect.",
        "But the language and the sanctions in the draft are softer than western diplomats had hoped.",
        "Ambassador Sawers says the U.S.",
        "intelligence estimate, that said Iran halted a nuclear weapons program back in 2003, made it tougher to agree on more punishing steps.",
        "The NIE gave a rather, if I may put it this way, some false reassurance about Iranian intentions, because it focused on one particular dimension, i.e. whether there was a weaponization program under way.",
        "Mike McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence, told senators this past week that if given more time to think about it, he probably would have written the unclassified version of the NIE a bit differently to emphasize other parts of Iran's nuclear research.",
        "There are three parts to a nuclear program.",

        "So what are we doing here?",
        "Sick doesn't believe the goal of zero uranium enrichment is feasible now that Iran is firmly on that path.",

        "That didn't happen last Thursday, but that could have been because there were lots of police around.",
        "So they're keeping that up at least until this Thursday which would be the two-week anniversary of the last attempted attack, which of course, occurred two weeks after the original deadly attack on July the 7th.",

        "My sense is that both sides, to some extent, in these exercises play lip service to the idea of greater cooperation, but, you know, really getting those communities to cooperate is another matter when it comes to hunting down people and giving information on, you know, people of your own tribe or family or whatever.",
        "We do understand that last week, on the other hand, the people in the Somali community were responsible for helping the police find one of the suspects from the July 21st unsuccessful bombings--the guy that they arrested in Birmingham.",
