        "I absolutely believe that there is a war on police.",
        "There are a number of factions that are waging the war on police, and one of the leading factions is the Black Lives Matter movement.",
        "And what is the nature of this war?",
        "Well, the movement - Black Lives Matter movement - has four basic objectives with respect to diminishing law enforcement.",
        "They want to disenfranchise the law enforcement from the community.",
        "They want to defund law enforcement.",
        "They want to diminish their involvement in the community and their stature, and they want to basically dissolve law enforcement.",
        "And the reason is because police officers are protectors of the rule of the law, and the Black Lives Matter movement is a black nationalist revolutionary Marxist movement that is tied into a much larger international movement referred to as One World One Struggle.",
        "Have you ever actually interviewed anybody connected to the Black Lives Matter movement - their objectives?",
        "Yes, I have.",
        "Like, name one.",
        "I have emailed members of the movement and have listened to their responses.",
        "I've had dialogue with them.",
        "And I think the most telling things are the research we do where we pulled up the actual videos of the founders of the movement going out and giving speeches and talks to various community groups.",
        "So tell me how you then extrapolate from that that you think that there is a war on police.",
        "Well, the Black Lives Matter movement has done everything consistent with having a war on police.",
        "The rhetoric is violent.",
        "You know, the most recent killings - the killer stated that part of the reason that he was inflamed enough to kill the police officers was because of the rhetoric from the Black Lives Matter movement."

        "So what should people do who object to the way the police have conducted themselves in their communities?",
        "What should they do in your view?",
        "Well, they have a constitutional right to protest and to protest peacefully in the streets, and to work with their legislators, work with their leaders to bring about, you know, effective change in policing.",
        "I think we need to keep in mind - we have problems in law enforcement brought about by the community, such as drug involvement, gang involvement, weapons violations.",
        "Do we need to continue to evolve forward?",
        "Absolutely.",

        "It would also make it easier to fire administrators, like those who doctored records to cover up huge backlogs of patients.",

        "Sean Carberry, NPR News, Kabul.",
        "Not that we needed any more proof, but the economy has been growing slowly.",

        "to Japan to Europe, central banks are pumping cash into their economies in what some call an unprecedented effort to push down interest rates and stimulate borrowing and investment.",

        "The amount of money central banks around the world are adding to the global economy is counted in the trillions of dollars.",

        "It's bad for consumers, says McCaughan, and it's bad for businesses and job creation.",
        "It's a perverse effect of something that was intended to improve employment.",
        "But not everyone agrees with McCaughan's analysis, and in the past week, oil prices have fallen again.",
        "Harvard economist Ken Rogoff says given the sluggish global economy, he thinks the risk of inflation from too much central bank stimulus is very small.",
        "And, he says, the potential rewards are worth the risk.",
        "Yes, we don't want to be a banana republic, where we have rampant, runaway inflation.",
        "But make no mistake: this is a very risky situation.",
        "The aftermath of financial crises - and Carmen Reinhart and I have studied 800 years of them - is long and ugly, and it could be far from over."

        "Rogoff says the massive central bank injections of cash should be seen as an insurance policy against slipping back into recession.",
        "The thing that makes the road back so difficult, says Rogoff, is the large hangover of consumer and government debt.",
        "Here's one way to think about what's happening: The central banks have filled a huge reservoir with cash.",

        "Uncertainty about the outcome of the election and the fiscal cliff has businesses paralyzed, says Wilcox.",
        "And he also says the Fed has pushed rates so low that it's much harder for banks to make a profit.",
        "It's definitely less profitable for us to make loans today.",
        "That's because the difference between the interest rate the bank pays the folks in Grand Rapids for their deposits and the rates it can charge for business and home and car loans has narrowed.",
        "That reduces the incentive for banks to lend, says Peter Fisher of the Wall Street firm BlackRock.",
        "How hard are the bankers going to work lending?",
        "You can lower the interest rate by sort of engineering it down to kind of try to get the people downstream to borrow more.",
        "But if they're not interested in borrowing, I think you ought to be trying to get the bankers to lend more.",
        "And if you keep pushing interest rates lower and lower, you discourage lending, says Fisher.",
        "It's just not worth the risk of giving someone a loan if your return is too low.",
        "In fact, Fisher believes the most dangerous unintended consequence of the Fed's low rate policy is that instead of boosting lending and the flow of money through the economy, it's restricting the flow.",
