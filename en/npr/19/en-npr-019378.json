        "But what the FBI is doing, Aarti, I mean, is talking about one phone, right?",
        "So, I mean, can you explain why Tim Cook is using such dramatic language and talking about how unlocking this one phone will make all Apple customers this vulnerable?",
        "Yeah, let's take an analogy that's been floating around.",
        "Say the iPhone is a safe in a bank.",
        "OK.",
        "So, you know, police want to get into the safe - see if there's drugs there or something.",
        "So they ask the bank to help crack the combo lock or, you know, give them unlimited time to crack it themselves.",
        "Well, here's where that analogy falls apart.",
        "In the physical world, you're just cracking the combo for a specific safe in a specific bank.",
        "When that safe is digital, when it's software inside an iPhone, it's code that's shared by every single safe - every iPhone.",
        "So when you figure out how to crack that code, you've created a master key.",
        "And yeah, you know, you can say we're just going to use it this one time.",
        "But you can't control if that really happens or if it falls into the wrong hands.",
        "Tim Cook basically saying, you create this master key, and you can say all you want that you're going to be able to hide it, but someone might get their hands on it.",
        "Right, exactly.",
        "Sound like a legitimate argument.",
        "But what's the other side say?",
        "You know, he's right about the way encryption works.",
        "That's just factually correct.",
        "But when he says that there is no precedent, you know, that's not really true.",
        "Cook wrote in that letter to customers that day the California court decision came out, he said, quote, \"\"we can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack.\"\" You know, well, back in the 1990s, the company Microsoft wanted to use a certain kind of strong encryption.",
        "But U.S.",
        "regulators said no; if you want to sell overseas, we think your software is so strong it's basically a weapon, and we're going to ban you from exporting that weapon.",
        "So Microsoft had to basically weaken its product so they could enter into foreign markets.",
        "So that definitely impacted privacy and exposed customers to greater risk.",
        "OK, so debate for precedent there is one part of this.",
        "How does this get resolved?",
        "You have this deadline looming tomorrow for Apple to respond to this court order.",
        "That's right.",
        "They have to respond by tomorrow.",
        "And, you know, they'll make their legal case.",
        "But Cook also suggested last night that maybe there's another way to address the situation."

        "Right now, a lot of U.S.",
