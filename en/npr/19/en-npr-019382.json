        "Well, I think that what happened in between when this crisis broke out and when Obama and his NATO allies decided to act was that the military situation changed on the ground.",

        "Well, the United States has already put quite stringent sanctions on Libya.",
        "What else was there to do in Libya?",
        "There was a lot to do.",

        "That's two different things.",

        "But in my conversations with both Arab intellectual leaders and with Libyan opposition figures American troops on the ground is absolutely unacceptable.",
        "Do you think that anything that the president is talking about can actually be made to happen without troops, Phyllis Bennis?",
        "I think that there is clearly a difference between having troops on the ground and having this kind of military engagement.",
        "But I think as far as people in Libya and in the Arab world and the rest of the world, the distinction is not all that great.",
        "What we're looking at is already mission creep.",
        "We first heard that this was going to be just a no-fly zone, then it was a no-fly zone with airstrikes against imminent attacks on civilians.",
        "Now it's airstrikes in places like very distant military bases, airstrikes on barracks where there are Libyan troops not engaged in fighting, and in fact we've seen what we've saw in Iraq in 1991 that was called a turkey shoot, where retreating fighters and retreating tanks were attacked by French and U.S.",
        "warplanes.",
        "Richard Haass, who is president of the Council on Foreign Relations - we heard from him earlier - he said on our program that he doesn't see any reason to be confident that the people who are opposing Mr. Gadhafi are people that we would be happy to see heading a government in Libya.",
        "That we don't really know who they are or what they stand for, and we might not like it if they succeed.",
        "Do you have that concern?",
        "I think that like all of the other parts of the Arab spring, this uprising is of a wide range of people across Libya.",

        "They do a massive readjustment.",
        "And after the election, I think what we're going to see is these groups spending more money just about issues before Congress, you know, more of this call your congressman, tell him whatever.",

        "All during the warm-up in Ohio, for example, the volunteers were urging people in the crowd to sign up, send a text message, join their neighborhood campaign team.",
        "And what the Obama team hopes is that these will be the people who will then volunteer to sign up new voters, to staff phone banks, to go door-to-door.",
