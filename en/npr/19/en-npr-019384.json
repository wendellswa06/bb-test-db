        "They either said they were busy, they're complying with the law, or they didn't call us back at all - and they don't have to.",
        "For most of these groups, there's almost nothing required in terms of donor disclosure.",
        "They can keep their funding sources comfortably hidden.",
        "But from sifting through the public files at two Pittsburgh TV stations, we did learn a few things.",
        "We learned that these groups are spending amounts of money that were unimaginable just a few years ago.",
        "One group can easily spend $100,000 or more at one station in a few weeks.",
        "Multiply that by four or five local stations in each area, and five or six groups spending at that level, and the amount of money flowing from secret sources to fund attack ads across the nation is easily in the hundreds of millions of dollars.",
        "In our two days in Pittsburgh, we saw ads attacking candidates of both parties, but the ones attacking Republicans were all from Democratic candidates or party committees, groups that have to disclose their donors.",
        "We did not see one ad from the supposedly nonpolitical groups that attacked a Republican.",
        "Here those are all aimed at Democrats.",
        "We know that this year, in the wake of Citizens United and other court decisions, corporations and rich donors can give as much cash as they like to these groups."

        "There were about 14,000 people at the arena in Columbus, Ohio, which is, you know, a good crowd by any estimation for May of a presidential year.",
        "But certainly, there were still empty seats, and they didn't have to turn anyone away as they sometimes did in 2008.",
        "Now, these rallies are coming on the heels of a disappointing jobs report.",
        "The economy, of course, will be or is expected to be the number one issue in the campaign.",
