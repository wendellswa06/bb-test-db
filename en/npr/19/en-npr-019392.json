        "Realistically, the Republican Party, would it be fair to say, has no leaders at this moment in time?",
        "Well, there are certainly leaders in Congress and governors and others, but there's no one person who is viewed as the leader.",
        "But that's not all bad because I think having a chorus of voices will actually be therapeutic and helpful to the party.",
        "There's going to be some new leadership that will emerge, hopefully with new ideas and new energy reflecting the changing nature of the country.",
        "Now, that leadership may well emerge from the governors that you're meeting with down in Miami.",
        "Governor Sarah Palin is an obvious name that comes to mind.",
        "Certainly seems open to seeking national office in 2012.",
        "What about her?",
        "Well, I think there's going to be a lot of governors, lots of members of Congress, hopefully people from the private sector, business leaders like Meg Whitman, who are going to be part of this, I hope, Republican renaissance.",
        "Governor Palin, I'm sure, will be part of that.",
        "Well, let me get away then from a particular person and just say, would she - the profile that she created during this last election - would that be the right profile for the party leadership?",
        "I don't think there's any one profile.",
        "I think if you start to just focus on identity politics, the party has to be bigger and broader than that.",
        "Governor Palin and many other governors will be certainly part of it.",
        "But I don't think it's going to be settled in on one person anytime soon.",
