        "So as Queen Elizabeth is watching the race, at least two people back home in London were watching her.",
        "Philip Somerville and Rachel Trevor-Morgan are the queen's hat makers.",
        "Between them, they created more than 16 hats for the six-day royal trip.",
        "And they didn't know whose creation her majesty chose to wear to the derby until she appeared this afternoon.",
        "We really never know.",
        "You see, we aren't told everything.",
        "It's very much a secret.",
        "The monarch is, of course, famous for her elaborate hattery.",
        "They're all very wearable.",
        "They aren't too big.",
        "And there are a variety of colors.",
        "As she said to me one day, remember that I'm not a young girl of 40.",
        "And so one has to be tasteful about the type of hats that the queen is wearing.",
        "Still Rachel Trevor-Morgan hopes to give the queen a fresh look.",
        "There's a white straw hat with black lace overlay, which I think is very new and unusual for the queen, and I'm very excited about the fact that she will be wearing that at some point.",
        "The millinery process begins actually with the dress.",
        "Somerville and Trevor-Morgan are given sketches and fabric swatches of the queen's new outfit and come up with several hat designs for her majesty to choose from.",
        "She often has her own ideas for modifications.",
        "And then there are the fittings.",
        "So much time and artistry goes into every hat, but the stakes are especially high at an event like the Kentucky Derby.",
        "It's very exciting.",
        "My finger's crossed that it might be one of mine.",
        "We've learned that some bookmakers even put odds on what color hat the queen would wear and whether it would have feathers.",
        "Well, no feathers.",
        "She's wearing a green straw hat, with a pinkish red scarf wrapped around it."

        "Would justice be served by the execution of Saddam Hussein before a verdict in the second case in which he's being tried, the one about the Anfal Campaign against the Kurds, as in northern Iraq?",
        "Well, Dr. Najmaldin Karim is president of the Washington Kurdish Institute.",
        "He's joining us by phone from Greenbelt, Maryland.",
        "And I gather, Dr. Karim that a lot of Kurds think that the prompt execution of Saddam Hussein would not be a case of justice being served right now.",
        "I believe that executing Saddam quickly will be travesty to justice.",
        "I fought Saddam myself in the ‘70s.",
        "I have had immediate family members killed by Saddam Hussein.",
        "Many close friends or relatives have disappeared.",
        "Saddam deserves punishment for Dujail.",
        "There is no question about it.",
        "But Saddam committed much more heinous crimes after Dujail.",
        "Before pursuing that a bit more, I want to ask you this - some people object to the execution simply on the grounds of their objections to the death penalty.",
        "Do you have any misgivings at all about executing anyone at this point in Iraq, including Saddam Hussein?",
        "I mean that's a personal - I mean when it comes to death penalty, I have my own views on death penalty.",
        "But the issue here is I think Saddam will be executed sooner or later.",
        "But executing him now, it will be travesty.",
        "What about those victims, what about history?",
        "If after World War II, the Nazi criminals were executed and didn't go through the Nuremberg trials, the new generation would not be able to know exactly what happened in World War II.",
        "And I think this is very important for survivors of those who perished during the Anfal campaign.",
        "Your objection is not simply a matter of fixing guilt to Saddam Hussein, it's spelling out what happened.",
        "The man can only be executed once, obviously.",
        "But the point is you feel there should be a trial documenting what happened in the Anfal campaign.",
        "Yes.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And in addition to serving justice to those who perished, I think that the trial can reveal also who was complicit in helping Saddam Hussein.",
        "There were people and countries who were aiding Saddam Hussein during those years, and I believe that going through with the trial with him there can reveal some of those facts.",
        "Can't there be, in addition to the trials that have taken place so far, some commission or forum or formal investigation into the Anfal campaign and the attempted genocide of the Kurds, that would establish an historical record and wouldn't necessarily require a continuation of the trial of Saddam Hussein?",
        "I think, being from the Middle East and from that part of the world, once the culprit is gone, then the tendency to go through any type of commission to document those crimes and atrocities that were committed will be very, very unlikely.",
        "Was this a case of the Iraqi courts not considering Kurdish sensibilities enough?",
        "Do you think that people said Saddam Hussein should not be executed for a campaign against the Kurds because that might not seem as legitimate to the majority Arabs of Iraq, a reason to execute him as a crime against Iraqi Arabs?"

        "There may be some Arabs who think that way, but in reality, I think that's even more the point why the trial should go on, because having the truth come out and what happened during those years when Saddam committed those crimes, will and most likely convince those who thought that this never happened.",
        "So for the trial to occur and for these facts to come out, I think it will be very helpful for them to understand what a criminal, what a beast Saddam Hussein was.",
        "Well, Dr. Karim, thank you very much for talking with us.",
        "Well, yes and no. In one sense, this was one of the reasons that she was a threat, because she didn't fit standard gender roles.",
        "On the other hand, except for her gender, she fits very much into the history of the period: the powerful monarchs of the East who were trained in not only the art of ruling, which would include commanding a fleet and going into battle and things like that, but also were educated people who were scholars and wrote treatises.",
        "But the thing that's unusual about Cleopatra is that no woman had ever done these things before.",

        "He fell in love with Cleopatra.",
        "He spent a great deal of time with her in Alexandria.",
        "Was it a real romance, or was it more of a strategic partnership, at least from her perspective?",
        "I think it was both.",
        "I think when they first came into contact, they both had an agenda.",
        "She, as I've said, wanted to keep her kingdom strong.",
        "Here's the most important Roman.",
        "It's a good person to be connected to.",
        "He, as the senior Roman commander in the East, was very busy untangling the mess that had occurred after the assassination of Julius Caesar, when Brutus and Cassius, the assassins, had gone to the East and had disrupted everything.",
        "So one thing Antony has to do is to summon all of the powerful people of the East to his headquarters in Tarsus to make sure they're on board.",
        "And obviously, one of these is Cleopatra.",
        "But clearly, it goes into a personal level very quickly, and nine months later, she has twins.",
        "I think it was a genuine romance.",
        "Duane Roller, how profound, do you think, was Cleopatra's role in the collapse of the Roman Republic, which, as you know, many historians date to the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at Actium in 31 B.C.",
        "and then, of course, the rise of the Roman Empire?",
        "I think she was very profound.",
        "I think history probably would've gone in slightly different directions had it not been for Cleopatra because she became the catalyst for Roman comprehension of a need to control all the Mediterranean."

        "But ironically, when the Roman Empire is established, and Augustus becomes the first emperor, he adopts many of the characteristics of Cleopatra, even the use of the color purple as the imperial color because that was Cleopatra's personal color.",
        "So in a sense, she helped create the Roman Empire and also brought about the fall of the Republic.",
        "She's a central figure in all of this, there's no denying that.",
