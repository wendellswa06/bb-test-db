        "Good morning.",
        "Now, can you really diagnose schizophrenia or manic depression in teenagers or preteens accurately enough to justify the use of this very powerful drug?",
        "We're doing a much better job diagnosing both schizophrenia and manic depressive disorder, or as we sometimes call it, bipolar disorder, in teenagers, less clear probably in preteens, but we're still much more aware of the criteria for diagnosis, and we're more effective in doing it.",
        "How effective then have you discovered Risperdal to be in treating schizophrenia and manic depressive illness in young people?",
        "Well, of course we don't have sufficient studies; that's why we're so pleased that the FDA has both done this approval for unlabeled treatment, but also that there will be follow-up studies and more attention to outcome research.",
        "Unfortunately, there's not been enough research on treating children, and children are not just small adults.",
        "They have different metabolic states, different response to therapies, and consequently they need to be studied more carefully.",
        "You know, I mentioned side effects in Risperdal has some pretty significant ones in adults: serious fatigue, diabetes; there's even a study linking it to death in elderly people with dementia.",
        "What kind of side effects does it have in kids?",
        "Well, Risperdal has a range of side effects in kids that are probably fairly similar to those in adults.",
        "We're always concerned about issues such as sedation, if kids are too sleepy or too tired to be part of their family environment or part of school.",
        "We're concerned about waking and the possibility of diabetes and obesity that is related to diabetes.",
        "We're also concerned, some of the more rare side effects.",
        "And the main thing is to monitor kids closely and for parents and families to work closely with the psychiatrist and the pediatrician about their kids' health.",
        "Well, you know, there's always concern about giving strong medication to kids.",
        "Are there not other treatments for adolescents with these problems?",
        "These days, with the Taliban long gone from Istalif, the presidential election seems to have brought out my friend, the potter Abdul Wahkeel's reflective side.",
        "Over the years, I've visited him often, and he's rarely spoken about the years of war.",
        "This time, in his home, surrounded by his children, he opened up with a sense that the worst is finally behind them."

        "You know, and they came and they destroyed everything here.",
        "They set the whole village on fire.",
        "The Taliban took a terrible revenge against the village, and also the farmers in the valley who'd put up such resistance.",

        "This area, all was surrounded by the Taliban.",
        "With that, Abdul Wahkeel gestures toward his oldest son, Omar, who's now 18.",
        "Omar doesn't remember the moment, but Wahkeel tells how, in the late 1990s, he hoisted the boy on his back and, avoiding landmines and rockets on both sides, walked with his extended family along a narrow dirt path for hours, finally ending up in Kabul.",
        "(Through translator) And we just sort of were a displaced people in Kabul.",
        "In the capital, Wahkeel found work pushing a cart until 9-11.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED AUDIO)",
        "(Through translator) We still have the road problem because it's not a paved road.",
        "Other than that, it's good because the pottery bazaar has attracted attention.",
        "On their days off, foreigners working in Kabul come here to shop for pots.",
        "And also in the summer, a lot of families come here to picnic and they also buy pots.",
        "When we visited this spring in 2014, a new generation of small boys were selling wild tulips along the road.",
        "The road to Istalif is now paved, a good thing for trucks carrying ceramic pots.",
        "And for some years now, Istalif has had electricity, though Wahkeel mostly throws his pots using his foot to operate the wheel."
