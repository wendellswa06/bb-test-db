        "Supreme Court?",
        "It's an unbelievable day for all of us because when I first graduated from law school, I clerked for a judge and she was the second federal woman district judge in the country.",
        "So, for us to be at this point and having a Latina on the Supreme Court, it is incredible.",
        "I would have never thought it at that time.",
        "Well, what went through your mind when you were watching Sonia Sotomayor take the oath today?",
        "Unbelievable pride.",
        "It is one of these things that all of us who have gone through the experience of law school at the time that we did, we just look at her and it is absolute pride and we are so happy.",
        "And her experiences, seeing her mother, what her mother had to go through as a single mom raising her two children and making sure that she provided for them and that they got the best and that they absolutely took advantage of the best, I think that's what really inspires all of us when we look at those experiences because all of us, many of us have had those experiences.",

        "I mean, I understand that Hispanic women are still vastly underrepresented in this profession, right?",
        "But what it does mean is that it really sets the bar very high for Latinas who are thinking about law school, and that's what this really means.",

        "Do we have a handle on the extent of the problem - how often flash-bangs cause serious injuries?",
        "Well, I looked hard to find out whether I could really quantify the scope of flash-bang injuries, and I found 50 people who were severely injured or killed in the past since 2000.",

        "Yeah, including several police officers who had them explode when they were holding them.",

        "They put very strict limits on the use of flash-bangs after a woman was killed in a heart attack when they threw a flash-bang into her house about 10 years ago.",
        "But other departments that I wrote about, like, for instance, in Georgia and in Little Rock, were throwing them on almost every raid.",

        "I haven't heard from other police departments about whether they're reevaluating use of flash-bangs.",
        "The problem is that with policing it's a very decentralized business.",
        "There are 18,000 police and law enforcement agencies in the United States, and there are no national standards for anything that they do, so they all get to make their own decisions on the use of these things.",
