        "But now, every time I sit down to play it, it takes me there, back to the Steinway grand in my little college in Western Massachusetts.",
        "It was the early 1980s, more or less the middle of the road of my life so far.",
        "And at this point, it was clear to everyone who had a sense of hearing that I would not be having a career as a concert pianist for reasons I am reminded of every time I sit down to play this piece.",
        "This knotty, little passage in the B section that I've always struggled with, I still do.",
        "The reason is because I still gloss over it without bothering to work out the kinks, so I can enjoy the luscious parts toward the end that come more easily.",
        "Maybe if discipline had been my strong suit, I might have had that chance at a career.",
        "(Soundbite of \"\"Solace\"\")",
        "By this point, I had also noticed that I would not be marrying the woman to whom I was engaged.",

        "As I played, she was standing in the doorway at the far end of the room.",
        "She was crying.",
        "It had nothing to do with the quality of my performance.",

        "It will dislodge any repressed pain and force it from your body, through your tear ducts when necessary.",
        "This piece had been with us for years and it was reminding us then of the good times and making it clear once and for all that they would not be coming back.",

        "He's thin and he's fit and he's obviously determined to make this trial into a platform so he can just assert the idea that he's the one who's the victim of injustice.",
        "The first thing this morning he refused to give the judge his name.",
        "He said, you know who I am.",
        "And when the judge asked his occupation he said, I'm the president of the Republic of Iraq and commander of its heroic armed forces.",

        "Well, they're really accused of murder on a huge scale.",
        "I mean, just the scale of this is unbelievable.",
        "There were tens of thousands of murders, men, women and children.",
        "The allegations are that they were by the most inhumane methods, including spraying poison gas.",
        "And this trial is also seen as a way to show the Iraqi people that former officials really will be held accountable for crimes.",
        "Now in Saddam Hussein's first trial, the trial where he's accused of crimes against the Shiites, that trial was criticized by human rights and legal groups for being badly run.",
        "Based on the first day of this trial, does it seem like anything's different with this one?",
        "Well, things got off to a rocky start today.",
        "The presiding judge apparently got mixed up this morning and he ordered the first witness to be called before the opposing sides even gave their opposing arguments.",
        "Plus, he also had a hard time controlling Saddam Hussein, who's still a master at getting the floor.",
        "Well, what have prosecutors said about how they hope to prove this campaign against the Kurds?",
        "Well, the chief prosecutor in his opening remarks paid particular attention to the orders that Saddam gave to his cousin, Ali Hasan al-Majid.",
        "He's the man who's nicknamed Chemical Ali for his alleged use of poison gas.",
        "Ali's one of these six other defendants and all of them were top-ranking advisors and military officers.",
        "It really looks as though the prosecution will try to follow the chain of responsibility up through these defendants and then on to Saddam."

        "And he's also very concerned about the potential of ISIS foreign fighters coming back to his part of the world.",
        "And so his solution is strengthen the state in Syria.",
        "And he points to Libya and Iraq and other weakened or failing states as a cautionary tale for Syria.",
        "I think President Obama rightly diagnoses that what has energized people to support ISIS in Syria is the brutality of the Assad regime against the Syrian people.",
        "Do they both have legitimate arguments to make?",

        "He cannot stay in power in Syria.",
        "As long as he does, ISIS will thrive.",
        "On the other hand, I do think that what Libya's gone through, what other parts of the Middle East where weak governments have been in place or challenged - I think that's a cautionary tale.",
        "And so to me, that speaks more to the question of how do we transition Assad from power.",
        "How do we do that in a way that tries to keep some state institutions intact and operating but bring in the full range of moderate opposition forces that are more representative of the Syrian people?",
        "Well, if you see a way - and if President Obama sees a way - to have some sort of transition, to remove Assad from power and he truly believes that that is the way to end this civil war, does he have to work with the Russians?",
        "I think we will have to work with all of the countries that have played a serious role in Syria, including Russia - Iran as well, and others in the neighborhood.",
        "I think part of Putin's move here, in terms of putting additional Russian forces into Syria, is actually also positioning for those negotiations.",
        "He wants to have a stronger hand over the ultimate outcome of a transition.",
        "One of the ways to improve his hand is to put Russian forces on the ground unfortunately.",
        "Can Putin be trusted?"
