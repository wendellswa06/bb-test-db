        "On January 17th, 1946, a psychiatrist named Walter Freeman launched a radical new era in the treatment of mental illness in this country.",
        "On that day he performed the first ever transorbital or \"\"ice pick\"\" lobotomy in his Washington, DC office.",
        "Freeman believed that mental illness was related to overactive emotions and that by cutting the brain, he cut away these feelings.",
        "Freeman was equal part physician and showman, and he became a barnstorming crusader for the procedure.",
        "Before his death in 1972, he performed ice pick lobotomies on no less than 2,500 patients in 23 states.",
        "One of Freeman's youngest patients is today a 56-year-old bus driver living in California.",
        "Over the past two years he's embarked on a quest to discover the story behind the procedure he received as a 12-year-old child.",
        "His story, My Lobotomy, was produced by Piya Kochhar and Dave Isay.",

        "We went into a room, and there was a stretcher there.",
        "He came in with something of a flourish, and he had his valise.",
        "And the first person was brought in and strapped down, given an electroshock.",
        "He had an instrument.",
        "To me, it looked like a nail, a great big nail.",
        "It was silver."

        "He was accused of doing many wrongful things, although in the end the court cases against him had nothing much to do with those activities of how he became rich and wealthy.",
        "Some of the charges against him were really almost farcical in the end, which is not to say this wasn't a guy who didn't do anything wrong, but in the end it was a case that told us an awful lot about politics in Putin's Russia.",

        "Well, explain that a bit.",
        "I mean just how did Mikhail Khordorkovsky run afoul of Vladimir Putin?",
        "Well, you know, to this day there remain many different theories about what actually transpired.",
        "What we know transpired was that he publicly challenged Putin at a meeting in the Kremlin when the oligarchs were gathered and he complained about a state company that was muscling in on oil territory, and basically he was trying to say, no, the rules of capitalism should be abided by and, you know, we don't want this interference from the state-run company.",
        "Putin took umbrage at that.",
        "All the oligarchs were aware that this is something that really offended the president.",
        "At the same time, there were elections taking place for the Russian parliament.",
        "Khordorkovsky, along with the other oligarchs, was openly financing multiple political parties and candidates in those elections, and so one of the stated reasons was that he was too nakedly trying to pursue political ambitions without directly doing the bidding of the Kremlin.",
        "As you communicated with Mikhail Khordorkovsky as he was in prison, how did he describe the conditions at the prison camps in Siberia where he was being held?",
        "Well, look, this is not Stalin's gulag anymore, but at the same time, there's just absolutely no question that conditions in Russian prison camps are absolutely horrendous, as bad as you can imagine.",
        "They sent Khordorkovsky as far away from Moscow as they possibly could.",
        "He faced violence from the other prisoners.",
        "He faced informants.",
        "In Siberia, and I've been there, it can be negative 40 degrees.",
        "It is unbelievably, horrendously cold.",
        "It is broiling hot in the summer.",
        "These are primitive work camps in the middle of the Siberian taiga.",

        "What's his future in Russia?",
        "You know, it's a fascinating question.",
        "One striking thing is that in order to receive a pardon in the Russian system, as in many systems, it requires at least an implicit if not an explicit acknowledgement of guilt.",
        "That was something that Khodorkovksy was very resistant to doing.",
        "This time, he's changed his mind.",
        "It required him to write a letter to Putin seeking his clemency.",
        "Does that mean that when he emerges that he will just quietly perhaps come to live here in the West to join his son?",
        "The resources, considerable financial resources that Khodorkovksy still has have been devoted to financing a real vocal opposition to Putin here in the United States and elsewhere in the West.",
        "And it will be very interesting to see if he picks up the mantle.",
        "He became a very articulate social and political critic of the regime from his perch in prison camp.",
        "Will he choose to continue with that political mantle, or just live a little bit of the life that he was denied for the last 10 years?",
        "We don't really know yet.",
