        "(Laughing) That's true of almost everything these days.",

        "And in fact, President-elect Obama has said he's targeting even a much higher number of Republicans.",
        "Yeah, he would like to have the bill supported on a broad bipartisan basis.",
        "So, you know, we all understand the need to do something and to do it quickly, and I think how it's ultimately crafted will determine how many Republicans support it.",
        "Could we go back for a moment to talk of the deficit?",
        "Which is a record deficit, $1.2 trillion, for this budget year.",

        "I'm asking, would you consider Social Security cuts, cuts in Medicare?",
        "The two huge systemic spending problems we have long-term everybody is aware of; Medicare and Social Security are simply unsustainable.",
        "I expect the current economic crisis will actually show down our willingness and ability to tackle those issues, but they're there.",
        "Well, it certainly makes it less appetizing, let's say, if there are more people unemployed, to talk about cutting Medicare or cutting...",

        "Well, you know, Americans are clearly tired of hearing about ethical issues in Washington.",
        "My colleagues, my Republican colleagues, I think, to a person, would prefer a fresh start that allows the people of Illinois to choose their new senator.",
