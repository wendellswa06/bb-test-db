        "Basically it's a meeting of self-described climate skeptics.",
        "These are - you know, for 20 years, ever since the global warming concept has been evolving in a big way in the science community, there's been a very vocal, mixed array of people who either outright reject the science, who accept that humans are influencing the climate, but it's inconsequential, or in some cases who are paid to be there, to sort of oppose regulations on pollution or emissions, and so it's a mixture.",
        "And what I sense this year - there was a little of this last year too - is they're realizing they have such a varied array of scientific explanations for what's going on with climate that they felt the need to sort of sync things up, to square up their own stories in some sense, because otherwise they're in danger of losing credibility.",
        "And what do you think has caused this change?",

        "What is his argument?",
        "Well, Russell Seitz is a physicist and kind of an independent thinker who's been studying climate and energy for a long time.",
        "He was at the meeting last year, gave a talk about the possibility of still burning coal; if you choose the right coal deposits they're - there is less CO2, less greenhouse gases produced per unit of energy.",

        "He had a strong sense that the political framing of the issue supersedes the need for the science to be accurate, so he's kind of frustrated.",
        "There's another scientist also who's chosen not to go to these meetings, John Christy.",
        "He felt this kind of event where you're sort of mixing policy and politics and ideology and science was again kind of counterproductive.",
