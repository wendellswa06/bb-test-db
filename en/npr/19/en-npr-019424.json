        "That was audio from \"\"Fox News,\"\" CNN, and Reason TV.",
        "It was rough to go through that, but a couple of good things came out of that for me.",

        "Not only did the court uphold the health care law, but the decisive fifth vote came from Chief Justice John Roberts, who concluded that ultimately Obamacare was not a mandate, but a tax on those who don't get insurance.",
        "Verilli had insisted on making that argument and had to fight some on the White House staff who didn't want to characterize the law as a tax.",
        "White House officials ultimately bowed to his view, in large part because they'd come to respect his judgment.",
        "Verilli entered the administration in the Justice Department in 2009, but was soon snapped up by the White House to serve as deputy counsel to the president.",
        "That White House connection prompted some concern among Republicans when he was nominated to be solicitor general - concern that Verrilli would be too political.",
        "Verilli says that, in fact, the effect was exactly the opposite because the White House politicos knew him.",
        "So they largely left me alone and let me run the office in the way I thought best - exercise the authority of the office in the way that I thought was best for the United States.",
        "I think it's a little ironic, but I do think my ability to have that degree of independence came from the fact that I worked there before I came over here.",

        "He died of a heart attack at the NBC studios in Washington, D.C.",
        "His colleague Tom Brokaw announced the news to a stunned array of journalists, politicians and fans.",
        "Joining me now to remember his life and work is Michele Norris.",
        "She is the host of All Things Considered, here on NPR.",
        "You have also seen a lot of her this electoral season on \"\"Meet the Press.\"\" Also with us is Gwen Ifill.",

        "Thanks, Farai.",
        "Good to be with you, Farai.",
        "So I want to start off by asking each of you, how did you meet Tim Russert?",
        "Gwen first.",
        "I would say I met Tim Russert 20 years ago, covering my very first presidential campaign, and he had just taken over as bureau chief for NBC News in Washington.",
        "At the time he hadn't had a lot of journalism experience, in fact none, and when took over, there were lot of arched eyebrows about whether he was up to this job and whether he deserved it, and whether he had appropriate journalism background.",
        "I didn't get to know him really well until I went - I started doing \"\"Meet the Press\"\" when I was working for the New York Times as an occasional panelist.",
        "And then he wooed me to come to work full-time for him at NBC, covering politics, covering congress, covering campaigns, and basically talked me out of my cushy job at the New York Times and over to NBC News, where he promised that I would be able to do the job I wanted to do, and he kept every single promise he made to me.",
        "So we became friends, he became my mentor, he became my boss, and he became just my cut buddy to talk political gossip with.",
        "So I'm missing him a lot today.",
        "Before I get to you, Michele, Gwen, we have heard that he's mentored several people of color, including Suzanne Malveaux, who is now of CNN.",
        "What do you think he found in you and Suzanne and the other people he mentored that he really wanted to do, not just for you, but for journalism?",
        "He found people who could tell him things he didn't know.",
        "He was a proud Irish Catholic son of Buffalo, New York, with his blue-collar roots, which have been widely documented.",
        "But he understood that he didn't know about other people's experiences, and it wasn't like he walked in and said, tell me about black people.",
        "It was that he knew if he surrounded himself with enough different kinds of voices who might see something different than he would see in a set of circumstances, that he would learn something new.",
        "And he was always kind of excited just to hear something put in a different way, or someone bring a different approach or say, or if - he loved you if it seemed like you also from a lower-middle-class or poor background that you could bond over your sameness as much as your difference.",
        "So I always found him to be - his curiosity to be the driving force which led him to bring different kinds of voices into our coverage.",
        "Michele, you bravely went on All Things Considered to talk about Russert just hours after he had past away.",
        "And for people who were not, perhaps, as big political junkies as we are, explain why this man - who was a named to Time's list of the 100 most influential people world-wide - but why was he so influential?",
        "I think he was influential because of who he was when he sat on that chair on Sunday Morning, and the kind of questions that he asked, and the respect and the integrity that he brought to that process.",
        "But I think there was something else, that he was - you know, Gwen noted that he came from Irish working-class roots, he never forgot who he was.",
        "And if you - I just remember running into him, for instance, traveling back and forth on the shuttle, between New York and Washington, D.C., and if you were late for a flight, woe to you if you were walking down the hallway with Tim, because he was stopped every fifteen seconds.",
        "And he made time for everyone.",
        "He came across not in anyway that was grand, but as someone who was very much the common man, someone that people could relate to.",
        "And I think he tried very hard to take the political process and make sure that it was understood by the folks who were sitting around in union halls and in bars and in classrooms back home, in Buffalo, where he came from."

        "He knew there was a place for that.",
        "In fact, he told people he knew that some people have that job, and he had a different job.",

        "I don't think any politician or everyone on \"\"Meet the Press\"\" ever felt like they were treated with a soft hand.",
        "And he had enough time that he would grill, and it was a great frustration to his producers, because they'd say, you have ten minutes Tim, and Tim was gone for 14 if indeed he was getting the answer.",
        "Sure, there are a lot of shortcomings in what we do, in our business, and my great fear and grief is that that is going to be a bitter shortcoming with Tim's loss, because I think he absolutely goes down with the reputation of being someone who really grilled, who was really tough.",

        "I would invite them to sit down and watch his interview with President Bush, where he asked a simple question, was this a war of choice or a war of necessity?",
        "I would ask them to sit down and look at his interview with David Duke, where when David Duke said, I'm not running on race, I'm running on the economy, and he asked a series of respectful questions, measured questions.",
        "He didn't necessarily bore down or beat him up, but he made clear that David Duke said he was running on economic issues, but actually knew very little about the economic issues that actually touched the lives of people in Louisiana.",

        "I will miss - I just miss him in general, but I'll miss the way he asked questions, I'll also miss the joy that he brought to the process.",
