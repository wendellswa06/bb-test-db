        "So it is a bit of a show game that's going on.",
        "But the fact of the matter is, despite whatever argument you may hear out there, millions of people out there did vote, and they, in fact, feel that they have been disenfranchised because their votes quote, unquote \"\"are not being counted,\"\" which runs counter to the argument that the Democrats obviously ran on and certainly campaign on from 2000 to the present.",

        "One thing I brought up with Ron Elving, of NPR, is whether or not we can see any trends in terms how white voters vote based on the population - how many African-Americans there are in states.",
        "Do you think that that makes a difference in how things play out among white voters?",
        "Well, it sure does.",
        "I mean, it depends.",
        "I mean, obviously, states like Kentucky and Oregon have lower African-American populations.",
        "However, states like Pennsylvania, as well as Ohio, and some other states that Senator Clinton has won have significantly large African-American populations.",
        "So to make the argument that Senator Obama has a structural problem right now with some blue-collar white Americans, that is factually correct in certain states, to be very clear.",

        "I know that's a huge question, but do you see any trends that you can point to?",
        "Yes and no. First of all, Senator Obama has done very well with white voters across the broad spectrum.",
        "He's had trouble in certain regions of the country, where perhaps for socio-economic reasons, voters tend to go with the familiar, meaning Senator Clinton.",
        "But I think overall, Senator Obama has done quite well with the white vote, when you consider that John Kerry, Al Gore, and even Bill Clinton had trouble attracting white male voters.",
        "Still, in Bill Clinton's case, he was able to win the presidency twice.",
        "Al Gore, he won the popular vote.",
        "And 2000 and 2004 was a very close election.",
        "I would argue that Obama doesn't have a, quote, unquote, \"\"white problem.\"\" Obama has a regional problem and winning certain states in Appalachia that may not be as attracted to his message of change and a new direction than they are, say, in other parts of the country.",
        "Senator Obama would not be leading right now in both the pledged delegates and superdelegates had he not been able to capture a large segment of the white vote.",
        "And according to the Los Angeles Time, on May 8th, in terms of a national poll, Senator Obama is behind Senator John McCain only four points.",
        "Senator McCain has 45 percent of the white vote, Senator Obama 41.",
        "So - and 41, if you can get 41 percent of the white vote as a Democrat, since the Democratic Party is has not won the white vote since 1964, you can win the election.",

        "Well, it is a mess.",
        "I mean, there is no question about it that it is a mess.",
        "I mean, obviously, a lot of people out there will try to put some lipstick on the pig, but the fact of the matter is is that millions of people in Michigan and Florida, despite what their state legislator did, despite what, you know, the delegates or whatever the case that the DNC did, these folks came out and voted.",

        "So, as a black woman, as I am, how do you think sexism plays out and racism?",
        "I mean, are the ways that they're express apples and oranges, or are they playing out similarly with the two candidates but in, you know, obviously, racism on one hand, sexism on the other?",
        "I think, first of all, there has been both.",
        "And this has been a historic campaign season, with two unconventional candidates, one woman, one black man.",
        "There is no question that sexism as well as racism have reared their ugly heads once again.",
        "Subtle forms, but still, of course, they're part of the undercurrents in American politics.",
        "But to somehow suggest that sexism or racism alone has defined this moment, when, in fact, the two finals are people who traditionally don't get to the finals.",
        "So I think we need to look at and not just the ugly forms of racism and sexism that I've seen throughout the campaign season, whether we are questioning whether or not Obama is black enough, and then he is too black.",
        "And we spend six weeks talking about if he is as angry as his minister as he, you know, is he out of the main stream, a patriot, or some of the ugly misogynistic terminology used to characterize Clinton's clothes, her hair, her sound of her voice.",
        "There is no question that we've seen both in this race.",
        "But I also think that we need to celebrate this moment.",
        "This has been a historic election season, record turnout, record participation, record amount of money raised, and that is because we have two equally qualified candidates running for the office.",
        "And there is no reason to stir up any additional resentment.",
        "Let's talk about racism.",
        "Let's talk about sexism.",
