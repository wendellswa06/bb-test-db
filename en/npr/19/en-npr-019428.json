        "Well, let's look at the demographics on both races, Democratic and Republican.",
        "Can we say anything about the trends by race, by first time voter, any trends among voters for the Democratic or Republican races?",
        "By and large the Democratic demographics were what we've seen in the past.",
        "In Maryland in particular we saw again where the African—American vote was overwhelmingly for Barack Obama, but he did not do comparably well among whites.",
        "Now, we did see a deviation from that in Virginia, which was the largest state that was voting yesterday.",
        "And in Virginia we saw for the first time a substantial portion - in fact about half - of the white vote going for Barack Obama.",
        "He also won among white men.",
        "He did not win white women, but if you look at all men, he carried two-thirds of all men and he carried 60 percent of all women in Virginia.",

        "It was not a one color success story.",
        "It was a multicolored — he even did better than he's done anywhere else among Latinos.",
        "So Virginia is really, if you will, the marquee state for the Barack Obama coalition that he wants to put together.",
        "What about independent voters?",
        "Independents or particularly first time voters seemed to have come out.",
        "Yes.",
        "In fact, first time voters are largely a creation in this particular cycle of the Barack Obama campaign.",
        "That's why they came out.",
        "It isn't just because they are suddenly interested in the political process; it's Obama.",
        "And in Virginia in particular Obama did so well among independents that he was the reason largely that Mike Huckabee threatened John McCain at all in Virginia.",
        "Otherwise McCain would have counted on five to 10 percentage points more from independents who were being attracted over to the other side by Barack Obama.",
        "Before we let you go, there are so many ways to crunch the delegates on the Democratic side.",
        "But specifically in terms of delegates that the two candidates have won, in the primaries and caucuses, how are they standing now?",
        "Yes, it's sometime called earned delegates.",
        "In that category Barack Obama is opening up something of a lead.",
        "In fact, at this point he even has a lead overall.",
        "But he has about a hundred delegate lead among what some people call earned delegates; that is those that are the result of a primary or a caucus.",
        "But because he still has a deficit of about 80 among those superdelegates who are going because of their position in the party or because they're elected officials, those people still are favoring Hilary Clinton, although about half of them haven't committed yet.",
        "And that cuts Barack's overall lead down to about 20.",
