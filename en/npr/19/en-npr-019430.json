        "Not at all.",
        "I mean, remember, in magic, you're trying to convincingly create the impression that something impossible is happening, and this means that it has to be perfect.",
        "You know that - I believe that if a singer is slightly off pitch for two notes of a song, you readily forgive that singer.",
        "If a magician is slightly off pitch, it completely destroys the whole effect because the moment there's a little bit of a flaw in what you're seeing, it no longer looks impossible.",
        "It looks like something sneaky is going on.",
        "So it is - I - not so long ago, I put a new piece into the \"\"Penn and Teller\"\" show in Vegas that I rehearsed every night after the show, worked on, developed for 18 months before the first performance.",

        "It's, you know, if you practice enough, you get the, you know, the mechanics of it.",
        "And like Teller was saying, I was actually a magician in, while I was living in England, who participated in the eye tracking that one of the universities was doing.",
        "They took videos of myself and some other magicians.",
        "And through that, I could see almost like a - a robot could do some sleight of hand in the rudimentary way, you know, get it, but where I've found, you know, the most difficulty and the most rewarding when it comes - when it gets right is in the, you know, like mind reading, or it's the same magic without any props because there's only your, you know, your words and the perception that, you know, you're altering their perception just with the words and, you know, through, you know, body language and stuff like that.",
        "It's been, you know, the most difficult and the most rewarding.",
        "And as I've performed in America and in England, I've seen some of the slight language differences have actually come up between, you know, performances and altering things."

        "And I note also that in your piece in the Smithsonian, you write about the importance of laughter in the illusion.",
        "So talk to me about where laughter fits in, the audience's laughter.",
        "Well, in - a little discovery that I think maybe Penn and I made on our own, but I'm sure magicians have discovered over the centuries is that laughter disables your ability to think critically for at least a moment.",
        "So if I do some move that might be slightly suspect to the audience and immediately afterwards there's a laugh, I can be pretty sure that they're going to forget any attention that they were going to give to that move.",
        "Even if it comes afterwards?",
        "Even - and especially if it comes afterwards, but it's that - it's - once you charge somebody up with emotion, you're putting them into a state where their critical thinking or what, you know, what Kahneman would call system-two thinking, that reflective thinking becomes harder.",
        "And you have to keep in mind, this also - I'm making this sound like this sinister thing, you know, that, oh, we're trying to get away with - well, maybe when the car salesman is telling you a joke just at the point where you were about to, you know, open the hood and look at the engine, and you go, oh, this is a nice guy.",
        "I'll buy this car from him.",
        "Maybe there, it's sinister, you know?",
        "In magic, you come in expecting and hoping that the person is going to amaze you and/or make you laugh.",

        "Yup.",
        "It's sturdy enough to pave parking lots and driveways, but so porous, looks just like a rice crispy treat.",
        "So rainwater trickles right through it, down to the ground below, rather than running off and flooding storm drains and sewers.",
        "It also allows you to actually feed the trees that may have roots running down there and all kinds of stuff underground, returning the water.",
        "There are other sustainable paving ideas out there, too, like cement that sucks up greenhouse gasses.",
