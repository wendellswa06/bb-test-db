        "Finally today, on Thursday, tens of millions of us celebrated Thanksgiving.",
        "And it's not just a day that celebrates food.",
        "It's also the beginning of a holiday season that focuses on food.",
        "And when we say food, be honest - we usually think first about the meats - the turkey, the ham, the brisket - you name it.",
        "But, for many people, meat is no longer the center of attention.",
        "According to The New York Times, the percentage of vegans in the U.S.",
        "has risen to 6 percent from 1 percent in just the past three years.",
        "And they have more options than ever.",
        "Now, that wasn't the case back in 1992 when Bill Muir went vegan.",
        "He says that back then, it was hard to find vegan food, especially once he joined the military and was deployed to Afghanistan as a combat medic.",
        "He writes about all of that and more in his new book \"\"Vegan Strong,\"\" and he's with us now from NPR West in Culver City, Calif.",
        "Bill Muir - or Sergeant Vegan, as he likes to call himself - thanks so much for joining us.",
        "Thank you very much for having me.",
        "Could you talk a little bit about why you decided to go vegan to begin with?",
        "So for me, I accidentally kind of walked into this whole thing.",
        "I gave up meat for Lent back in '92 kind of as a joke.",
        "I was a punk rocker, a little bit rebellious then.",
        "And people said that I was going to die.",
        "People thought that it was going to be the end of my life just not eating meat.",
        "And I - after the end of Lent, which is only 40 days, I actually got healthier, and I felt great, and I thought, maybe there's something to this.",
        "And around that time, too, I started thinking about what I was doing and what it all meant, and I decided that I was doing this for the animals, and I realized that it was also very good for the environment as well, and for my health.",
        "And one of the, I think, most surprising things about your story and, frankly, what got my attention is the fact that you maintained a vegan diet when you joined the army, when you went through basic, when you were deployed in Afghanistan.",
        "What was that like?",
        "Well, it actually depended on what I was doing at the time.",
        "During most of my training other than basic training, like when I was - I was a paratrooper, so I got paid to jump out of perfectly good airplanes.",
        "And, during that training, it was, hey, eat what you want to eat.",
        "Go where you want to go - other than, obviously, you have to jump out of planes still, and you still have to train.",
        "OK.",
        "But it wasn't always easy.",
        "I mean, basic, for example, or boot camp, as it were, was particularly difficult.",

        "Why was it so hard?",
        "Well it's just the lack of vegan options was really, really difficult to deal with.",
        "And I probably was working out I would say about 18 hours a day on 1,500 calories or less.",
        "And so what was the attitude there?",
        "The attitude was that you're here to learn to conform and no variation - you eat what we give you.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And, to be honest, it wasn't like what I thought it was going to be where someone was standing and yelling in my face that I have to eat this, I have to eat meat.",
        "Nope - none of that.",
        "So that's why I was able to maintain being a vegan.",
        "It wasn't like people were trying to hold me down, push food in my face.",

        "Government forces have been trying to pierce Tamil Tiger defenses in order to reach some tens of thousands of civilians who are being held by the Tamil Tigers for months now serving as a buffer against government assaults.",
        "There are reports of some of these civilians wading across a lagoon, essentially wading across the frontline to get to safety.",
        "Have you confirmed that?",
        "Yeah, well, that's pretty much the way a lot of people have escaped.",
        "There were about 130,000 who escaped the same way shortly after April the 20th.",
        "And as of this afternoon we have begun getting reports of thousands of people, once again, wading across the lagoon, which suggests that government forces have managed to get close enough to be able to give these people a chance to break out of the combat zone.",
        "But, still, many left.",
        "And you're saying that the civilians who are on the other side are being held by force by the Tamil Tigers.",
        "We've had good indications of that for months now.",
        "Civilians who have escaped have told us many, many stories of being forced back or shot at as they were escaping, with people being killed as they were trying to escape.",
        "It's pretty clear that the - that at least for a very large proportion of the people in there, they were there against their will."
