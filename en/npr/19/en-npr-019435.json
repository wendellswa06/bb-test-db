        "Obviously because he's taken the weight off the rears and the horse has to stand somewhere.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Are there any indications that the horse is in pain or uncomfortable?",
        "Actually, I talked to Doctor Dean Richardson at University of Pennsylvania's veterinary school today and he says the horse is fine.",
        "He's bright-eyed.",
        "He's taking mints and carrots out of people's hands.",
        "So he seems pretty happy.",
        "He's not in any pain at all.",
        "And they have said the whole time that they're only going to treat the horse as long as he is well and eating.",
        "It's one of those things that people do feel such an intimate connection to, because the people around the animal have been very forthcoming and many people are logged on following his recovery - very, very closely - and have developed an attachment to the horse as a fighter.",
        "Very much so.",
        "The vet himself is just - sounded so tired and so frustrated.",
        "In fact, he said that's an understatement, because this horse has been - I mean, on the Web site, thousands and thousands of hits every day.",
        "There's a place where you can send postcards to the horse on the Web site.",
        "So both for his owners, the people taking care of him, and the people that have been following this story.",
        "It's been kind of close to the heart, especially for those of us who love horses.",
        "Which sounds like you do.",
        "Yeah, that would be me.",
        "And I've had one for years.",
        "So if they can't manage to have Barbaro pull through this, what's the prognosis?",
        "They're really not sure.",
        "There is a risk of complications from this procedure because the problem is the cannon bone that the brace is supporting might break.",
        "And if that breaks, they may actually have to do something - to go so far as to putting him down.",
        "But right now they're waiting to see if there are complications from this procedure."

        "What they're hoping to see is that this so-called external brace can hold for six weeks or so to give that hoof - I'm sorry - that leg time to heal so that they can finish treating the abscess.",

        "And Julie, why don't you explain a bit more about what exactly the president's proposal will be?",
        "Well, it's kind of a tax swap.",
        "Some people would pay more and some people would pay less.",
        "Now right now, the tax system treats health insurance premiums differently depending on how you get your health insurance.",
        "If you get it from your employer, you don't pay any taxes on it no matter how much it costs.",
        "If you're self-employed, you can deduct your premiums from your income tax.",
        "But if you work for a company that doesn't offer health insurance or you don't qualify for the health insurance that your company offers and you buy your own, then you're completely out of luck.",
        "Now President Bush wants to let that last group also deduct the cost of their insurance, and to pay for it, he made employer-provided insurance over a certain amount taxable for the first time.",
        "The cap would be $15,000 for family coverage and $7,500 for individual.",
        "Now that's more than the average currently, but it's not that much more than the average.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "The winners would clearly be the 17 million Americans who currently buy their own coverage now and don't get any tax benefit and then hopefully some number of uninsured who could afford insurance with this new tax break.",
        "The losers would be those with very expensive health insurance.",
        "Now the administration's been talking about executives and highly paid professionals, but really it's just anyone lucky enough to have generous health insurance, which could include moderately paid people who have given up wage increases to get better health benefits and certainly some union members.",
        "And if you look at how this might work over time, would that change the number of people who are affected?",
        "Indeed.",
        "It certainly could and that's one of the criticisms that we're already hearing.",
        "Administration officials say the top amount will be indexed, but probably not to medical inflation, and medical inflation tends to rise much faster than regular inflation.",
        "So we could quickly end up with the same situation we have now with the alternative minimum tax, which was put in to make sure that millionaires paid their income taxes and now we see that it's hitting many, many thousands of middle income households.",
        "So the pool would broaden, essentially.",
        "Indeed.",
        "It sounds, Julie, like there will be a fair amount of political push back on this.",
        "Why don't you give us some sense of who's lining up for the president's idea and who's lining up against it?",
        "...and it's hardly - it's just barely been presented in print at this point."
