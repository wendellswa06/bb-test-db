        "President GEORGE W.",
        "BUSH: It is time for Iran to make a choice.",
        "We've made our choice.",
        "We will continue to work closely with our allies to find a diplomatic solution.",
        "But there must be consequences for Iran's defiance and we must not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.",

        "Ambassador to the U.N.",
        "John Bolton says the Security Council will not be considering possible sanctions against Iran until at least next week, after the foreign policy chief of the European Union meets with Iran's top nuclear negotiator.",
        "Amid talk of nuclear weapons, diplomacy, and Iran's intentions, we hear very little about what Iranians are thinking.",
        "To get a glimpse of some of the political discussions within the country, we turn to Michael Slackman.",
        "He's correspondent for The New York Times in Tehran.",
        "It's a very diverse society here.",
        "I mean I think it's dangerous to talk about all Iranians.",
        "Certainly, he's very popular among a segment of the population, but his popularity is waning a bit because he was elected primarily on an economic message.",
        "When he ran for president he promised that he would see to a redistribution of their oil wealth.",
        "That's what people are looking to him for, not really to get into conflict with the rest of the world.",
        "That said, I think he has really struck a chord not just among his initial followers but among all Iranians who feel that indeed the United States does have no role in telling and dictating to Iran what it should do with its nuclear program, or any program for that matter.",
        "Earlier this week, Michael Slackman was at an unusual press conference called by Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which highlighted what Iranians on the street had been telling him, that their biggest concerns have to do with the economy.",
        "The neat thing about Iran is, despite having an increasingly authoritarian government, there is real civil society politics.",
        "I'm not sure exactly what you call it, but people do expect the government - not necessarily the leadership but the government - to deliver on real pocketbook issues.",
        "In this press conference you're talking about, the president - this is the one where the president of Iran called out the president of the United States for a face-to-face debate.",
        "It was clear they wanted this to be another kind of political coup for them.",
        "What seemed to emerge from the trip to Baghdad and the uncompromising statements that followed is that Mr. Bush has made himself a hostage to history resting his legacy on this war.",
        "This is Daniel Schorr."

        "Right.",
        "What was it again?",
        "I think it goes to that old saying that you can find a statistic to prove any argument.",
        "I think you can quote a sentence or two of this document and find that you can prove either of those points of view.",
        "So to that end, yes, we're hearing the president and his aides cite passages about Iraq.",
        "The judgment that Iraq has become a cause celebre for jihadists and that abandoning Iraq would hand those jihadists a victory.",
        "The president's camp says that underscores what they have been saying all along, that Iraq is central to the war on terror and that the U.S.",
        "needs to stay the course.",
        "Democrats read this differently.",
        "Democrats are citing that same line about Iraq become a cause celeb for jihadists and they say this bolsters our view that invading Iraq was a huge mistake, that the war in Iraq overall has made Americans less safe.",
        "Can you find language in this NIE that would back up the view that the president has stated many times, which is that the U.S.",
        "is winning the war on terror and that Americans are in fact safer now than they were before?",
        "Well, I think we bear in mind that this report is written as a neutral intelligence assessment, so it's not designed to answer those questions neatly.",
        "But my reading overall, this paints a bleak picture.",
        "I think the single most important sentence, we may look back and view it as being, and I'll quote here, \"we assess that the underlying factors fueling the spread of the movement outweigh its vulnerabilities.",
        "In other words, the terrorist movement is likely to grow more quickly than the West's ability to counter it.",
        "You know, clearly there are some relatively positive points.",
        "The report cites counterterrorism efforts have, and I'll quote, \"seriously damaged the leadership of al-Qaida and disrupted its operations.",
        "But overall I think it would be hard to read this document and walk away thinking the U.S.",
        "is winning the war on terror.",
        "There is, though, language in this document that would seem to support the president's argument that the U.S.",
        "should stay the course in Iraq, as the administration puts it.",
        "There's language that says if terrorists think they have won in Iraq that that would inspire more fighters to continue the struggle elsewhere.",
        "Right.",
        "And the White House has singled out that line that you just quoted.",
        "There's another passage later on that makes a similar point in a different way.",
        "It says, \"should jihadists leaving Iraq perceive themselves and be perceived to have failed, we judge fewer fighters will be inspired to carry on the fight.",
        "So again, yes.",
        "These are lines that the White House is arguing supports its position in terms of staying the course, that the original decision to invade Iraq was the correct one."

        "Have the reports predictions come to pass since that killing?",
        "Yeah, it's a good point.",
        "The report actually writes about a specific scenario, the loss of key leaders in quick succession, and it judges that that would cause the broader movement to fracture and that the resulting splinter groups might for awhile at least pose a lesser threat to the U.S.",
        "We clearly haven't seen the exact scenario described there unfold, of course, of losing key leaders in rapid succession.",

        "Well, he was arrested back in September of 2004.",
        "State security agents nabbed him in a Pizza Hut restaurant in Shanghai, and this was after the New York Times had just reported that then President Jiang Zemin was going to retire his last post as head of the military and complete the transition to the new president, Hu Jin Tao.",
        "And the New York Times correctly reported this in advance and it apparently angered the Chinese government and Zhao was arrested shortly thereafter and he's been in prison for almost 22 months now without a trial.",
        "So did Zhao Yan get a leak from a government official that tipped him to this?",
        "Both Zhao Yan and the New York Times say no. He did not receive any classified information on the retirement of President Jiang Zemin.",

        "Was it open?",
        "Were Zhao's attorneys able to present a defense?",
        "Well, it was far from open because it was deemed to involve state secrets.",
        "It was held at an intermediate court in Western Beijing and defending Zhao was a very prominent attorney named Mo Shaoping, who has defended some of China's best-known political dissidents.",
        "And we also understand that Zhao defended himself in court.",
        "He pleaded not guilty.",
        "But we also understand that no witnesses were called.",
        "That's not how the defense wanted it.",
        "They had requested that the bureau chief in Beijing for the New York Times take the stand as a witness, and the court shot down that request.",
        "The trial went on for eight hours.",
        "There was no verdict, and it is now up to the judges to deliberate and they have close to a month to do that before they render their verdict.",
        "This is the same friend?",
        "For breakfast, I would often have Frosted Flakes.",
        "So they had cereal that was vegan, but, of course, they didn't have soy milk, so I would have my cereal either plain, or then I started branching out into using orange juice or fruit cocktail.",
