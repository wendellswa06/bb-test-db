        "They think consumers should be more responsible for their own health spending, at least know how much more that it costs, through things like health savings accounts.",
        "So if you give incentives for there to be less generous health insurance, and this would clearly be one, that maybe that would have a downward pressure on this.",

        "Democrats read this differently.",

        "But my reading overall, this paints a bleak picture.",
        "I think the single most important sentence, we may look back and view it as being, and I'll quote here, \"we assess that the underlying factors fueling the spread of the movement outweigh its vulnerabilities.",
        "In other words, the terrorist movement is likely to grow more quickly than the West's ability to counter it.",

        "The report cites counterterrorism efforts have, and I'll quote, \"seriously damaged the leadership of al-Qaida and disrupted its operations.",

        "should stay the course in Iraq, as the administration puts it.",
        "There's language that says if terrorists think they have won in Iraq that that would inspire more fighters to continue the struggle elsewhere.",
        "Right.",
        "And the White House has singled out that line that you just quoted.",
        "There's another passage later on that makes a similar point in a different way.",

        "So again, yes.",
        "These are lines that the White House is arguing supports its position in terms of staying the course, that the original decision to invade Iraq was the correct one.",
        "There's also speculation in this report on the impact of the killing or capture of certain terrorist leaders, Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in New York and this report was done in April and since then, of course, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed.",
        "Have the reports predictions come to pass since that killing?",
        "Yeah, it's a good point.",
        "The report actually writes about a specific scenario, the loss of key leaders in quick succession, and it judges that that would cause the broader movement to fracture and that the resulting splinter groups might for awhile at least pose a lesser threat to the U.S.",
        "We clearly haven't seen the exact scenario described there unfold, of course, of losing key leaders in rapid succession.",
        "You know in terms of what we can say about the impact of Zarqawi's death, his group has continued to carry out vicious attacks.",
        "Most notably a few weeks ago we had the murder and mutilation of two U.S.",
        "soldiers south of Baghdad and Zarqawi's group claimed responsibility for that.",
        "On the other hand, there are growing indications that some Iraqi tribal leaders may be fighting back and saying we won't support you.",
        "Overall in Iraq, we saw very high levels of violence this summer and fall, but that's not necessarily the work of Zarqawi's group."

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "But if you look at the archaeological, the earliest archaeological materials that we know from the western side of the Western Hemisphere, all down the west side of North America and South America, there is a technology, a way of making stone tools that really has an Asian flavor to it.",
        "And it probably fits with genetic and other evidence that much of the ancestry of the Americas derived out of Siberia, biologically and technologically."
