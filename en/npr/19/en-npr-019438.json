        "On the other side of the continent, some of the earliest archaeological evidence that we have actually has a - and this includes Clovis - has a technological signature very similar to the Solutrean culture of primarily France and Spain that dates between about 21,000 and 16,000 years ago.",
        "Those - that technology is so similar that it's awfully hard to imagine it having sprung up independently in two different places.",
        "So then you have the question of: How do you bring a culture across the North Atlantic?",
        "A, we know that if anyone got to the Americas before about 13,500 years ago, they almost certainly had to come by boat because the entire span of Canada, from the Pacific to the Atlantic, was under an ice sheet.",
        "So people had to have come around that.",
        "If they came down the Pacific Coast, they're bound to have used boats along - probably along the near shore.",
        "We know that people in Japan were plying the waters of the Pacific by 33,000 years ago in boats.",
        "We know that people arrived on the Solomon Islands and Australia by 50-or-so-thousand years ago.",
        "That had to have involved watercraft of some kind.",
        "So boat technology has a great time depth in human technological history.",
        "The nature of the waters of the North Atlantic and the North Pacific is such that they support one of the most enormous biotas in the world.",
        "The numbers of fish, sea mammals, seabirds and even land mammals - if you want to include the polar bear - those food masses make the Serengeti Plain look like a desert.",
        "Yet you say this theory is not very well accepted?",
        "That's true, but - and it's because nobody has very thoroughly and systemically put together all the various lines of evidence.",
        "That's about to change later this year.",
        "Dennis Stanford of the Smithsonian Institution and Bruce Bradley of Exeter University in England have a book that's in the final stages of editing at the University of California Press putting together the oceanographic, archaeological, ethnographic evidence that really tightens up that hypothesis.",
        "And they simply presented it as a hypothesis, but I find it a very compelling one.",
        "1-800-989-8255.",
        "It is a really interesting theory.",

        "It's extremely courageous, considering the environment you're doing it in.",
        "My question was why Clovis points have never been found in Siberia, but yet Solutrean - which you already addressed - points in the Iberian Peninsula and Southern Europe are virtually indistinguishable.",
        "My second question would be: Have you read \"\"First American\"\" by Chris Hardaker?",
        "And I would get off the air.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I'm aware of Chris Hardaker's work, but I haven't read it.",
        "So I will sidestep that part of the question.",
        "The - I think the reason we don't find Clovis in Siberia is that it never was there, that this was a different tradition of tool-making.",
        "It shows up in east -northeastern Asia, and all the way down from Alaska to southern Chile and into the interior of the Americas quite some distance.",
        "I believe that that is a trip of - a movement of technology out of northeastern Asia and down the western side of the Western Hemisphere.",
        "Okay...",
        "It could involve both.",

        "Well, by the time of Clovis, I think people have been here quite a number of thousand years.",
        "The Freidkin site certainly suggests that.",
        "The Monte Verde site in Chile suggests that, one to 2,000 years older than Clovis.",
        "So by then, people had spread from the coastal margins, all across the interior of the Americas.",
        "And the earliest discoveries of Clovis almost exclusively were at places where Clovis points were associated with skeletons of mammoths.",
        "And mammoths are very big animals, and they're very big bones.",
        "And people would spot these in gravel quarries or in erosional gullies and so forth and so on.",
        "And they would attract their attention, and they get poking around, and they would find artifacts associated with those bones.",
        "The artifacts that you've uncovered that you say are thousands of years older than Clovis, when you look at them, are there any signs on them that might point to a coming of Clovis later?",
        "That's a debatable question.",
        "I sort of lean toward the fact that most of the Freidkin artifacts don't suggest a continuity with Clovis.",
        "But the - professor Waters and his research group at Texas A&M feel like there are more similarities, and that they may have an antecedent to Clovis represented there.",
        "Well, this will be a debate that'll go on for some time, I'm sure.",
        "Well, I'm working on a site just literally 300 meters from the Freidkin site.",
        "That's the Gault site.",
        "It is an enormous Clovis site - the largest, the most prolific Clovis site in the Western Hemisphere.",
        "I've been working on it for 20 years.",
        "We're nearing the end of our fieldwork and beginning to do the analysis.",

        "...a little preview?",
        "It, too, has stuff older than Clovis that we've found and not yet reported.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And we'll wait for you to come back and talk about it, because it looks like we - as you say, we are opening up the debate one more time."
