        "It might play better in Oklahoma, but if you can tie these independence-minded, sort of, moderate Republicans in Massachusetts to the more conservative - significantly more conservative, Republican Party nationally, that's a recipe for success here.",
        "Ken?",
        "Jim, we keep talking about Brown and Coakley, and I guess we all agree that Markey and Gomez are not Brown and Coakley, but the Democrats learned a lesson, I guess, in 2010 when they were caught napping with that election, and of course not - they're not suffering from overconfidence this time with President Obama, Bill Clinton, all the big-gun Democrats coming in to campaign for Markey.",
        "O'SULLIVAN: There's no question that that was a formative election for a lot of the Democrats here.",
        "These guys ended up with eggs on their faces.",
        "It was embarrassing; it was humiliating.",
        "They'll talk about it now.",
        "They're pretty candid about it.",
        "They'll say, look, that was - we lost that one.",
        "We fumbled it away.",
        "There's no excuse for us to have blown that like we did.",
        "And they're determined not to let it happen again.",
        "That's why you're seeing what I think could be a historic GOTV, get out of the vote effort.",
        "I think that you're seeing President Clinton, President Obama, the first lady, Vice President Biden is here on Saturday I believe.",
        "They are just sort of grimly set on not blowing this one.",
        "And I mean frankly, if you look at the numbers, there's no reason they shouldn't win.",
        "The registration is such, and special election turnout is such, that if you blow a special election as a Democrat in Massachusetts, it's really on you.",
        "Is there any national figure who would help Mr. Gomez?",
        "We saw Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, of course.",
        "John McCain was there, too.",

        "I'm not sure that there are any Republicans who would have a substantial impact.",
        "It's really about the persona, and you need a cult of personality to develop around this candidate if it's going to work.",

        "Jim, Boston Globe had like a 12-point spread the other day, and...",

        "Thirteen points, yeah, and we're hearing that Gomez has it maybe closer, six, seven.",
        "Do you have a guesstimate what's going to happen?",
        "O'SULLIVAN: I don't.",
        "I mean if you're Gomez, you really want to be a lot tighter than that at this point just because of the infrastructure advantages that we've talked about that Democrats have.",
        "Their voter turnout operation is far superior.",
        "They're better organized in the state.",
        "They've had, like we've said, a succession of big-name figures.",
        "Gomez is absolutely not where he wants to be and hasn't been able to sort of illuminate the race in a way that would transcend something that's beyond just Republican versus Democrat special election.",
        "Has the national Republican Party come in on Mr. Gomez's behalf?",
        "This was seen as an opportunity, maybe, certainly given the Scott Brown example, and also a template maybe if the party is going to say we're a big 10 party, we're going to be - we like independent-minded people from New England that this would be an opportunity.",
        "O'SULLIVAN: Right.",
        "And it's been somewhat of a mystery to people around Gomez why they haven't played more.",
        "I think they understand that it's a gamble.",
        "You don't want to spend big and lose.",
        "But certainly as the party goes through its sort of post-2012 ruminations, you would think that Gomez as a Latino candidate who's a little bit more moderate, a little bit more centrist, can talk - he has shied away from criticizing the president harshly.",
        "You would think that they want to take this for a test run.",
        "I think people around Gomez are a little bit surprise that they haven't played more here.",
        "There was also an effort to get a pledge from both camps that neither would solicit outside money.",
        "Well, the outside money that's come in has come in on Mr. Markey's behalf.",
        "O'SULLIVAN: Oh, significantly.",
        "And that they - you're referring to the people, the so-called people's pledge, which both Brown and Warren took.",
        "And it's - I won't go into the details, but it frustrates and throws up disincentives to outside groups coming in and spending money.",
        "And Markey pushed for that.",
        "It was - sort of curiously, it was his opening attack right after the primary.",
        "He pushed Gomez to sign this pledge, and Gomez resisted.",
        "The result of that has been that Markey has been able to benefit from all this outside money while Gomez is getting heavily outspent.",
        "We're talking with Jim O'Sullivan, the political reporter for The Boston Globe.",
        "He's at the offices of the newspaper there.",

        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And you've said that this - this is an affliction, the infrastructure problems, as you've described it for Republicans in Massachusetts.",
        "It's the same all over in New England.",
        "Is the party in any better shape anywhere else?",
        "O'SULLIVAN: Well, Massachusetts is a little bit different than the rest of New England.",
        "It's, you know, the party is down in New England.",
        "There's no question.",
        "It's a - they're largely bereft of Republican figures up here, and it's a problem.",
        "It's a regional thing, and it's something that the party if they want to continue to play in New England.",
        "They've have success here in the past.",
        "In Massachusetts alone, we had 16 straight years of Republican governors from Governor Bill Weld for two terms to Governor Cellucci, and Jane Swift was not elected but was acting, and then Mitt Romney."

        "So that race, I think, was seminal for a lot of Republicans up here who look and said, jeez, you know, he's running against the guy with real problems.",
        "He's a popular, likeable Republican.",
        "He's a moderate Republican, and he can't pull it off.",

        "He's been fundraising for Gomez.",
        "He talks favorably certainly of Gabriel Gomez, but then again, he went out today and said that he could, quote, \"\"absolutely,\"\" unquote, beat Ed Markey, which is not particularly helpful, I don't think.",
        "I'm not sure how many politicians are out there that Senator Brown doesn't think he could beat.",
        "But he's not come out strongly for Gabriel Gomez.",
        "He hasn't been out on the trail for him in any significant fashion.",
        "He's really sort of relegated to the sidelines in this.",
        "And Scott Brown benefited himself, A, we mentioned those very good ads that he ran, but he was also a well-spoken candidate who didn't commit gaffes and did well in the debates.",
        "Mr. Gomez apparently has, well, inexperience has shown.",
        "O'SULLIVAN: No, I think that's right, and I think, like I said, both of these candidates have been underwhelming in the debates.",
        "I think you also can't overstate how much a man of the moment Scott Brown was where there was - remember, it was late 2009.",
        "There was a real sense of dissatisfaction with the Obama administration.",
        "There was - he was also running against a candidate who by her own admission ran a weak campaign.",
        "Some Democrats here would go farther and say she ran a terrible - Coakley ran a terrible campaign.",
