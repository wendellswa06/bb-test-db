        "We're in such a strait at this moment where partisan issues between the parties seemed to have stratified and ossified might be a better word.",
        "Well, I think all those -ifieds are applicable.",
        "In this particular case, we have a wonderful statistic to sum it up.",
        "In the last election, the district that voted for Barack Obama to be president voted 95 percent Democratic for their House seats.",
        "In other words, the people who wanted a Democratic president, wanted a Democrat representing them in the House.",
        "And on the Republican side, same deal, 95 percent.",
        "So we have a House of Representatives in which the parties are almost totally, almost utterly partisanized.",
        "They're almost utterly at odds with each other, at the opposite extremes on almost every issue.",
        "As we were just talking about the politics in Massachusetts where structural issues make it very difficult for a Republican to win statewide, and Jim O'Sullivan of the Boston Globe was telling us in a lot of congressional districts too.",
        "But that could easily be said of Democrats in a lot of Southern states.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There - it's almost reached a point where in some states there's not much of a point in running in the party that doesn't have any kind of standing.",
        "State of Kansas, for example, it's become very difficult for a Democrat to get elected to office in Kansas at practically any level, but particularly, of course, at the statewide level.",
        "And this is true of many of the Western states.",
        "And, of course, because every state gets two senators, even the ones that have the smallest population, this winds up giving us an absolute base of Republican senators from, primarily, bigger states in terms of geography, smaller states in terms of population.",
        "And that hard base of Republicans represents a smaller and smaller percentage of the total number of people in the country but remains essentially a stalwart base for the Republicans in that chamber.",
        "Ken just looked over and sort of asked for a permission to ask a question.",
        "Does he do that on IT'S ALL POLITICS?",
        "No, never asked for a permission.",
        "I never asked permission.",

        "I just want to say that, Ron, I'm a big fan of your work.",
        "Now, but - I was kidding about that.",
        "But what's real or true, a lot of people blame like redistricting for the kind of partisanship we have today.",
        "They talk about cable TV, that the MSNBCs and the FOXs of the world preach to the converted.",
        "But what about somebody who may be independent-minded, he or she always has the risk of being taken down in a primary by the more extreme left or right.",
        "That's right.",
        "And we have increasing numbers of landslides in November for House elections and Senate elections, but particularly House elections.",
        "It's lopsided in November.",
        "And so the fear factor - and all members of Congress have a huge fear factor - they're always afraid that their career is going to come to some abrupt end - has transferred itself from losing to the other party in November to losing in the primary in the spring or the summer or the early fall to a member of their own party who comes along and is more doctrinaire and orthodox and beats them.",
        "Most extraordinary example we've had recently of course was Richard Lugar in Indiana, long-time senator.",
        "Six-term senator?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Six-term senator.",
        "He was knocked off by a guy most people in Indiana probably didn't know very much about before he got the nomination.",
        "He was defeated in his primary, and then the guy who beat him in the primary lost in November.",
        "Yeah, but, of course, there were a lot of other reasons why Lugar lost.",
        "We talk about residency, the fact that he didn't show up a lot.",
        "But former Congressman Bob Inglis of South Carolina whom we used to have - we've had on Political Junkie on TALK OF THE NATION many times, he was a true, true dyed-in-the-wool conservative, and yet in the primary, he was not conservative enough.",
        "That's right.",
        "There were other people who could come along and say, well, Bob Inglis, you were there in Congress when bad things happened.",
        "I believe also they went after him for voting for CARP, the toxic gas relief program, the emergency bailout for the banks.",
        "After President Bush asked him to, yes.",
        "Well, and very specifically and personally asked him to as Bush did to get that through in the fall of 2008.",
        "Like Inglis as a second language.",
        "As a second language one could almost say.",
        "This is why I play the straight man on the podcast."

        "It's a well-worn role for all of Ken's partners.",
        "But at any rate, this is the kind of thing that produces real change in the way legislation gets done and real change in the way the country gets governed.",
        "There are experiments in redistricting to have it done by bipartisan or nonpartisan basis.",
        "Given the experience of Republicans though in Arizona and in California, are these going to get any traction?",
        "The Republicans object to the way it's been done in Arizona and California, which did not help the Republicans much, and they expected in both cases that it would.",
        "And the supposedly completely nonpartisan commission seemed in the end to more or less lean Democratic or help the Democrats win more seats.",
        "Pretty much the only state I've seen where it's been done and most everyone has been pleased with the result, more or less, was Iowa, a much smaller, much less complicated state than California.",
        "So it's a little hard to imagine how it's going to take over in a Florida or a Texas or places where it's always been on an extremely partisan basis.",
        "Do you see the idea that some Republicans are pushing now?",
        "There are places like Maine, for example, where you win the presidential votes on the number - on the basis of - per congressional district, not winner-takes-all in each state.",
        "Maine - I think Nebraska is the other place who does this.",
        "They already do it, and we did see in 2008 that the Omaha-based district of Nebraska split from the rest of the state of Nebraska, voted for Barack Obama, not by much but by a little, so Barack Obama got one vote out of Nebraska in the Electoral College.",
        "But that's pretty unusual.",
        "We really don't see that in presidential elections very often, but if you did the country that way...",
        "There was a proposal to do it in Pennsylvania.",
        "Yes, and if you did the entire country that way, you would wind up with something very much like the House of Representatives' margin for the Republicans and Mitt Romney would be the president today.",
        "So that's why at least on a partisan basis, some Republicans would argue this might be fairer at least for them.",
        "Ken."

        "Well, I was going to say, I mean, actually, what happened is because so many of the Democratic base is concerted in smaller districts and more urban districts whereas the Republicans are fewer or less populated but spread out all over.",
        "So - but I mean, if you think of that - if you had that in Texas though, I mean, then the Democrats would obviously have a shot at getting electoral votes in Texas.",
        "If you had that in California, Republicans would have a shot of getting that in California.",
        "But everybody knows that the way it looks right now, this would be to the Republican advantage.",
        "I don't think there's any question.",
        "The Republicans, as you say, largely on the basis of the natural distribution of their vote, do better when you go by this particular system.",
        "That's why in, say, Pennsylvania, for example, the Democrats came out narrowly ahead in the statewide vote for the House of Representatives in last November's election, not by a lot but by some, and they wound up with only a third of the seats in Congress from Pennsylvania.",
        "The Republicans with a minority of the vote actually got two-thirds and the same thing happened in North Carolina.",
        "No one thinks that's great.",
        "No one thinks that's a wonderful result, but it is partly gerrymandering done by highly partisan legislatures and governors, and it's also partly the fact that the Democratic vote is so concentrated in the urban areas.",
        "And we should, of course, note by - gerrymandering is a bipartisan game.",
        "Maryland is the outstanding example.",
        "Most recently, again, Republicans didn't lose the congressional vote that badly and they have, what, one of Maryland's six seats.",
        "They're hanging on by a thread in just one district.",
        "You can do this, either party can do it.",
        "Both parties love to do it.",
        "You can draw the map using highly sophisticated computers and computer software so that you perfectly distribute your own vote to beat the other guys in almost every district.",
        "Ken?",
        "Ron, what lessons - and we always talk about the lessons of 2012 that the Republicans ignored or disparaged the Latino vote.",
        "They lost the Asian vote overwhelmingly.",
        "Female voters were against the Republican Party for an assortment of reasons.",
        "So we think that the argument was that the Republican Party learned something, but then you have a vote like the abortion vote in the House yesterday.",
        "What did they learn out of 2012?",
        "I believe they learned they don't want to run against Barack Obama again because they think that Barack Obama had a unique appeal to voters under 30 who were more numerous than voters over 65.",
        "That, too, is unusual.",
        "And they went 60 percent for Obama.",
        "They think he has an unusual appeal, obviously, to African-Americans but also to Hispanic and Asian-Americans and that that will not be replicated for another Democrat in 2016.",
        "They don't think that anyone else is out there who can do that.",
        "That's an open question.",
        "And even if, let's say, Hillary Clinton, the odds-on favorite if she runs, should be the Democratic candidate in 2016, sure, she might not have the exact same appeal to some of those minority groups that Barack Obama had or to the young voters, but she will probably have a stronger appeal yet to women and a stronger appeal yet to many white voters.",
        "So there probably isn't a magic formula in all of this except that, and as I think you've said, most Republicans who have really thought about this very much think the answer is they have to broaden their appeal so that at least they don't get an overwhelming anti-Republican vote from Hispanics and Asians and African-Americans.",
        "You also spoke about the use of sophisticated computer demographics for redistricting more and more in get-out-the-vote efforts.",
        "And Republicans say they learned from Barack Obama who managed two brilliant get out the vote efforts."

        "Yes, really something beyond what we'd ever seen in the Democratic Party before.",
        "So, yes, you can credit some of it to Obama's particular appeal to these groups.",
        "You also have to take your hat off to the people who were working for him.",
        "They work constantly pretty much straight through from 2006 - late 2006 all through '07 and '08 straight through his first term in the office so that they could be there to bring people to the polls for his re-election in 2012.",
        "It was a well planned out, beautifully orchestrated effort by some people who are very talented and whether they can reproduce it for another candidate is kind of the holy grail for Democrats.",
        "But that is one the lessons of 2012 also because the Republicans, even though had so much money and even though they had these out - so-called outside groups, they spent most of their money on TV, whereas - and not get out the, you know, building organizations within the states.",
