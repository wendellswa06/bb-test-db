        "Virginia is going to be interesting if not necessarily as a national bellwether as we've treated it in the past - and at times, we've even treated New York mayoral election as a bellwether for the whole country.",

        "There is a strong social conservative, very highly orthodox, aggressive social conservative.",
        "He's going to divide the electorate, to some degree and his supporters are going to be strong for him.",
        "On the other hand, the Democrats have Terry McAuliffe, a guy who's primarily associated with the world of raising money for candidates and supporting and organizing for candidates, the Clintons, in particular.",
        "And I'm Luke Burbank.",
        "Cam - sycamore.",
        "And he has not been elected to public office before.",
        "And his personality maybe is not going to drive quite so much of a Democratic loyal base.",
        "But on the other hand, maybe he can make himself acceptable enough so that people who don't like Ken Cuccinelli or who are repelled by the Republican lieutenant governor nominee, E.W.",
        "Jackson Jr., who is fiery conservative, fundamentalist preacher, those people will repair, perhaps, to the standard of Terry McAuliffe as an alternative.",
        "And as we look ahead to 2016, the off-year elections, the Democrats, again, have a difficulty with numbers in the Senate.",
        "The great number of Senate seats that are up are being defended by Democrats.",
        "They have an opportunity to lose their slender majority in the United States Senate.",
        "Thirty three seats, I believe, on the ballot, perhaps one or two more by 2014.",
        "The Democrats are defending 20, at least.",
        "Once again, the odds are stacked against them.",
        "Twenty one.",
        "Actually, because of the special election, 21 Democrats, 14 Republicans.",
        "So there you have it.",
        "It's 3-2, and it's, you know, it's tough to win if you're always playing defense.",
        "On the other hand, the Democrats manage to defy even longer odds in the year 2012 when they were more or less expected to lose six or seven seats and wound up gaining two.",
        "The big question - the big asterisk on 2012 was they had a presidential election to drive turnout, as we've talked about.",
        "We can't expect that kind of Democratic turnout in 2014.",
        "What you would expect in 2014 would be a return of the electorate that voted in 2010, the great, if you will, Tea Party revolution against Barack Obama.",
        "If we see another one of those in 2014, pretty hard to imagine that the Democrats don't lose control of the Senate.",
        "They will probably lose a couple of seats under the best of scenarios and they could certainly lose four, five, six, if it's another Tea Party-type turnout."

        "There is a poll coming tomorrow from Stanley Greenberg and James Carville, well-known Democratic pollsters, in which they're going to contend that the playing field is much larger than anyone imagines that many more seats in 2014 in the House are going to be contestable.",
        "It's a tough sell.",
        "It's a tough sell.",

        "The difficulty, of course, for the Democrats in 2014 is that - well, I should say the difficulty for the Republicans to gain more seats as we expect them to do because it's the six-year itch...",
        "(Unintelligible)",
        "...is because, first of all, they picked up 63 seats in 2010 so there's not that many vulnerable Democrats left to be picked off.",
        "That's right.",
        "But on the other hand, because of the redistricting we've been talking about, there's a kind of a bastion here in which even if the country's sentiment is not violently anti-Obama as it is sometimes been anti the incumbent president in the six-year itch election, 2006, with George W.",
