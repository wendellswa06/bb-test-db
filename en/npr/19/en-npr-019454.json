        "Eakin says he shouldn't have had to sue the agency to get Bud Kelder identified, that this should have been routine work.",
        "JPAC officials maintain the reason the process can be slow is they take great care to not just make a positive ID, which is easier now with DNA testing, but to identify and return as full a set of remains as possible so families can have closure.",

        "It seems much more challenging, though, to evaluate how effective a charity is at meeting its goals.",
