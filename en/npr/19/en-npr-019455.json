        "And the specter of it is always hovering, especially in times like this when you hear stories of people for whom this is very real and present.",
        "So, as a columnist, sometimes you write a column and you throw it up there and you think, mm, I wonder if anybody will respond.",
        "How was the response?",
        "Oh, I got a ton of response.",
        "And it was so interesting to me the diversity of answers.",
        "So, you mentioned, you know, one guy who said he wouldn't sell his tools.",
        "That was really smart, you know, that's like the guy who said, I wouldn't sell my fishing pole.",
        "You know, this is something that you can work with, you could actually make a living with.",
        "But the guy who wouldn't sell his Harley Davidson, well, that's pure romance.",
        "You know, that's - it's also transportation, but it's symbolic.",
        "He went on to say it represented something romantic to him - freedom.",
        "And then a woman who wrote in and said she wouldn't sell her, quote, unquote, \"\"perfectly sellable bassinet\"\" that her two children, who are now 12 and 13, had slept in when they were babies, that she had sold all the other baby stuff, but she held onto that because that to her was just redolent of those warm, sweet-smelling bodies.",
        "And then, one woman said she'd never sell her framed icon of Our Lady of Guadalupe, you know?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So it really ranged from very practical items that people could make a lot of money for, a lot of jewelry - people mentioned wedding rings, charms, bracelets.",
        "Do they have a - you mentioned the diversity of people and of items.",
        "Can you find a common denominator?",
        "That is a tough question.",
        "No, I really can't.",
        "I think there would be two camps - one which would be things that were so useful that letting them go would make it harder for you to make money, so your tools, for example, or your transportation.",
        "One guy said he wouldn't sell his bicycle because he would always want a cheap way to get around.",
        "So there was that category of stuff, the useful stuff.",
        "And then there were the sentimental items.",
        "Now, some people wrote in and they had sentimental items that, you know, they would have a tough time selling anyway.",
        "So the fact that they didn't want to sell them didn't represent all that much.",
        "But there were people who wrote in - a guy who had a 400-year-old very valuable painting that he claims he'd never sell.",
        "Now, if he were hungry, I bet he would, but I think he would hold onto it for a long time.",
        "So, useful was one category, sentimental was the other category.",
        "We're speaking with Mary Schmich.",
        "She's a columnist for The Chicago Tribune.",
        "She wrote a piece that was titled \"\"What Would You Never Sell, Though Desperate for Money?\"\" And, well, we're just kind of taking your question today, Mary.",
        "We'll be honest about it."

        "How were you proposed to?",
        "Well, it's the youth that's associate with it and it's the time in my life when I was young and it was the change in my life.",

        "And they're both almost naked-like, but in a very tender fatherly pose of a young boy.",
        "And it's just something I've never seen when looking at art things.",
        "I'm sure there are some out there, but it just seems to me I always see the mother with the child.",
        "And it's just - was such beautifully done in such a way that it just - it's one of the things I actually had to have.",
        "I don't do that very often, but I had to have this thing.",
        "And they had to write to the artist and she was able to sell me the proof.",
