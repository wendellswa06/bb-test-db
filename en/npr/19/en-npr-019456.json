        "It seems like when I listen to people, it's memories that they want to retain.",
        "Right.",
        "And the memories are so attached to these physical things.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The - one of my favorite notes, the one I ended one of my columns with came from a woman who said, as the child of an Auschwitz survivor who had to leave her home and was not allowed to bring any possessions, I have tried not to get too attached to objects, even though I own as many as most Americans.",
        "Well, you know, you still get - the bullets still work when you've only been in for three years and you're still taking a lot chances and you're still making a lot of sacrifices after three or four years.",

        "We want these tangible objects that tell us who we are or who we're connected to, where do we came from.",

        "He has made a surprise pick for vice president, she's a hit here at the convention at in St. Paul, and among Republicans generally.",
        "So he has people thinking differently about him and how he goes about making decisions.",
