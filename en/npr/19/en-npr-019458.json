        "So it's not as though they're broken away from the past, but they have pushed away the Bush presidency, I think rather effectively, and John McCain is going to try to perfect that tonight and give us a sense of the new party that is all about a kind of reformist zeal and a John McCain who is his own man.",
        "And the kind of John McCain who would breakaway from all precedent and choose Sarah Palin to be his vice president.",
        "Well, if those are his points, what are his weak points to things that he might stay away from?",
        "You just mentioned a moment ago what's happening on the markets today, in the markets today.",
        "The new job figures are quite discouraging, the economic news is rather dismal.",
        "We have a series of hurricanes coming up the coast in the wake of Gustav, which, thank goodness, was not any worse than it was.",
        "We don't really know what exactly is happening over in Iran and with this incursion into Pakistan.",
        "We have the vice president in Georgia promising these folks that we're going to protect them in some way, although there doesn't seem to be any military commitment to do so.",
        "We have the ongoing uncertainty about what the situation is in Iraq.",
        "The general run of issues is not positive to the party in the White House and that has - it's been in the case all year long and even longer but this is intensifying just now as we head into the final weeks of the campaign.",
        "So the big challenge that John McCain and the Republicans have is that they're bucking history.",
        "No president's party has had an incumbent in office as unpopular as George W.",
        "Bush is today and been able to hand off the presidency from that unpopular incumbent to a successor of his own party.",
        "And one thing, you talked about Iran, John McCain and certainly Sarah Palin last night talking about change.",
        "You can not help but notice the audience in the room as you panned around, the cameras panned around, the Democratic National Convention in Denver and as they pan around at the Xcel Center there in St. Paul, Minnesota, these audiences look very, very different.",
        "Well, they couldn't look more different.",
        "I suppose, in many respects, too, whether dressed, the age groupings, but particularly of course, race.",
        "I mean, we had in Denver a convention delegation from just about every state.",
        "That reflects the full diversity of the country.",
        "The Democrats enforce that.",
        "They say you must send so many people of this group and that group.",
        "You must split equally between the genders and so on.",
        "So that when you see them on the floor, if they look like everybody, they kind of have to because that's a numerical requirement.",
        "The Republicans are not nearly so devoted to that, not nearly so prioritizing of that, and the people that you see tend to be rather well-dressed and they tend to be Anglos, they tend to be Anglo-whites.",
        "Now there are many Hispanics.",
        "There are some blacks - dramatically fewer than they were the last couple of Republican conventions - and this is a somewhat more homogeneous crowd for reasons that are probably pretty obvious.",
        "There's a lot of enthusiasm among African-Americans even independent and Republican ones this year, for Barack Obama.",
        "Ron Elving, I know you're going to have interesting evening.",
        "Thanks very much for taking the time to speak with us today.",
        "My pleasure, Neal.",
        "Ron Elving is NPR senior Washington editor with us from NPR's election headquarters at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul.",
        "And by the way, you can listen to live coverage of that convention's proceedings on many of these NPR public stations and online at npr.org.",
        "After Senator McCain finishes, we'll also be back to hear your response to what he had to say on an NPR election call in special so stay tuned for that.",
        "Again, on many of these NPR stations, and at npr.org.",
        "But right now, we'd like to hear what you want to hear.",
        "You'd be interested to hear from Senator McCain tonight and let's begin with Susan.",
        "Susan is calling us from San Antonio in Texas.",
        "Yes.",

        "Senator McCain, as you probably know, sponsored the immigration reform Bill that failed in the last session of Congress.",
        "Did you want to hear him talk about that or about securing the border first?",
        "Well, I think we have to secure our border before we can have - control the illegal immigration because I think if he changes his position back to wanting to get what people want to say about the illegal immigration, I think, we'll just have people pouring over our borders.",
        "Until we control them, we can't stop it.",
        "And that's the primary you're going to be listening forward tonight?",
        "Yes.",
        "All right, Susan.",
        "Thanks very much for the call.",
        "Appreciate it.",

        "Go ahead, please.",
        "I was kind of - I'm a Republican.",
        "I had been a fan of, you know, McCain for a while.",
        "I was kind of turned off in listening to what was going on about his history in voting on veterans' benefits.",
        "I enlisted during Vietnam.",
        "I put in good time and an honorable discharge and I don't go to the VA because I know there's kids coming back that need the help more than I do but I sure would like to get there someday and I would like to see him improve the benefits.",
        "There was a recent bill proposed by the Democrats that would have extended something much more like the GI bill from World War II days and Senator McCain was - I think his basic argument was that he's certainly not opposed to veterans benefits but he said, it did not encourage people enough to stay in the service.",
        "They would have gotten those benefits after just three or four years in service, and that he said they ought to encourage people to stay in a little longer before they could collect its benefits.",
        "Thank you."

        "And basically, we want to hear, wish we could hear, not what's we're going to hear.",
        "We're going to hear rhetoric again, I suppose, but what I'd like to hear is a way to get out of foreign oil, our tendency on it will be what - you know, like geothermal, heating, electricity, hydroelectric stuff or steam and not solar - solar, like we have gigawatts in the desert now - and then the wind.",
        "In Upstate New York here, we're doing a lot of wind.",
        "Senator McCain has a lot of those wind turbines in his commercials.",
        "Nevertheless what...",
        "That's good but we need a cryogenic grid, too, have you heard of that?",
        "A cryogenic grid?",
        "Yeah, that's in Albany.",
        "That's something extremely called, I take.",
        "Yes.",
        "But it makes the electricity flow with less resistance.",
        "I understand.",
        "But Senator McCain's primary message through the campaign has been a drill here, drill now.",
        "That's good - American oil is good.",
        "But, how much do we import?",
        "A lot.",
        "About 20 million barrels a day, something like that."

        "Solar alone in a desert, as big as a gigawatt now, and we have a cryogenic web to get it to other places with less resistance as negative one million, positive one million.",

        "For example, he talked about unwanted pregnancy, getting back to, OK, we have different views on abortion but can we come to some agreement about we want less unwanted pregnancies our nation?",

        "He worked with Senator Kennedy, for example, on some bills and worked most notably, I guess, people remember Russ Feingold on campaign reform.",
        "Yes.",
        "This is true and I want to hear more of how he will go about doing these things, given right now, we are so split with focusing on the personalities of our candidates and their personal lives and all these very specific things.",
        "I want to hear about, suppose McCain is elected, we - we're going to have across the board, you know, a lot of disparity and difficulties, I would think, in being able to get agreements because we're going to have such a close match.",
        "And so I would like to hear about if he's elected, how is he going to work to push America forward and not just, you know, become a lame duck president where nothing can get done.",
