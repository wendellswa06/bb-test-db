        "Right.",
        "What was it again?",
        "Well, one former Penn State player said, wait.",
        "You're telling me that all those games on the sidelines were - show the Penn State had a higher score than its opponent, that didn't happen?",
        "That's the thing about vacating wins.",
        "The players felt like you won.",
        "Everyone celebrated.",
        "People know what a win was and what a loss was.",
        "But the reason that they took away the wins is because it's one of the things the NCAA does.",
        "It also busts Joe Paterno down from the all-time winningest coach and Division I to some place, I think, fifth on the list.",
        "They subtract 111 wins.",
        "I'm of a couple of minds on this.",
        "I think you can make the argument that the NCAA was a little bit self-serving in taking away the wins.",
        "Now we don't have to look at that NCAA record book and see the name Joe Paterno up there.",
        "Perhaps the NCAA - as an institution, as opposed to Penn State - perhaps they're more comfortable with saying, you know, Joe Paterno, we don't have to look at that name on the list, and every time we do, think about all the horrible deeds.",
        "Then again, vacating the wins is - doesn't really have any cost, and it does make a little bit of a statement.",
        "Some also pointed out that Penn State took down Joe Paterno's statue, but will keep his name and that of his wife on the library for which they donated so much money.",
        "Well, let's not do an entire 180 on Joe Paterno's legacy.",
        "He was a great coach, and he really did believe in education, more so than he had to.",
        "And the learning part of his legacy - giving to the library, I mean - that was true.",
        "So I don't see that as bad as you think he might have acted or not acted or his nonfeasance in this case was, you know, the Paterno name on the library did mean something.",
        "And at some point, you know, this is an institution of higher learning.",
        "You have to grapple with your history, good and bad.",
        "So a statue says one thing: This is a heroic man who we should all honor.",
        "The name on the library maybe says something else.",

        "So, I mean, I think I'm (unintelligible) in the fact that I think that this really unfairly punishes student athletes financially and kind of cynically shows that the NCAA is more about financial considerations than anything else.",
        "But really, my question is more like: since this scandal was really implemented at a higher level (unintelligible) within the university, I mean, by this president, what do we do?",
        "Do we punish - like, how do we punish the executives that are involved, beyond due process of law?",
        "I mean, by this standard, it seems that we should do something like dissolve or limit the university for four years.",
        "Well, Mike, I was interested by one thing that head of the NCAA, Mark Emmert said, and that's the NCAA reserves the right to go after individuals, here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I'm not sure exactly what that means.",
        "And also, he's not going to supersede the court cases that are pending against some of the former Penn State executives - obviously, not the late Joe Paterno, but the former athletic director, and so forth.",
        "Peter, though, I was interested - you said penalizes the students monetarily.",
        "How?",
        "Well, I mean, it really puts all the athletic teams at Penn State in jeopardy, not just football.",
        "And for financial reasons, I think $6 million is a ton of money for an athletic program.",
        "And given the financial state of state schools, it, you know, it's obviously terrible.",
        "But, you know, it's a question of whether or not the Penn State athletic program can survive that's really constructive.",
        "And that seems to me to unfairly punish people who aren't even involved with the football program at all, like people who run track or play basketball, or what have you.",
        "Well, in the Q and A session, this was posed to him, and he - Mark Emmert was explicit that this is not to take any funding away from any of the other programs at Penn State, and Penn State will have to find the money from its general fund or somewhere else, and it can't come from other programs.",
        "Yes.",
        "But that's exactly the point, is that it's a question of whether or not that money actually exists.",
        "And now that there's this increased imposed financial hardship from - basically, limiting the football team's ability to make money through these scholarship reductions (unintelligible).",
        "I mean, you'd have to be pretty naive to think that that's not going to severely affect the athletic program, generally, going forward, no?",
        "Well, you know, I think that you could also make the case, maybe, over the next five years.",
        "Penn State reinvents itself as a basketball school.",
        "They become Indiana or something.",
        "I mean, some other sports, maybe, get some spotlight and some place in the sun.",
        "Mark - Peter, thank you very much for the call.",

        "Yeah, Neal, thanks for taking my call.",
        "I just wanted to say as a resident of Pennsylvania and someone who has grown up in the shadow of Penn State football, I think the NCAA's actions were really appropriate.",
        "But what I wish they would have taken into consideration or perhaps done was to earmark some of that penalty money specifically to child sexual abuse prevention here in Pennsylvania, as opposed to nationwide, simply because the victims in this particular case were the young men from Pennsylvania.",
        "We are the state that will deal with the fallout.",
        "And frankly, because Penn State is a partially state-funded school, I think the citizens of the commonwealth deserves some of that back.",
        "What do we know about this fund, Mike?",
        "Well, I don't think we know a lot about the fund.",
        "And I was always of the opinion that Penn State itself would take the lead, perhaps using this as an opportunity to become the leading center on the study of child sexual abuse and the various pathologies involved.",
        "The president of Penn State says he's onboard with all of these penalties.",
        "The head coach says he's not resigning.",
        "He understood what he was getting into.",
        "I wonder how much of these penalties were done not over the objections of Penn State's president, but maybe because of Penn State's president himself tried to impose a whole bunch of very harsh penalties, there'd be an outcry from alum and an outcry from some of the backers, financial backers.",
        "So maybe this takes it off the president's plate.",

        "And I think for those who may want to do things on the cheap or take risks - unnecessary risks that pose hazards for the crew - I think they'll certainly think twice about doing that kind of thing in light of what's happened because the penalties can be pretty severe.",
