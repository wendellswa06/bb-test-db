        "Of course, the president, who sought drastic changes in U.S.",
        "policies, is running again.",
        "And the Democrats who want to replace him are aiming for big changes of their own.",
        "But they don't really agree about how to manage those differences.",
        "And those differences were revealed in interviews that we have done here on MORNING EDITION, where we've been listening to some of the opening arguments from some of the prominent declared candidates in the Democratic field - five of them so far.",
        "So let's start off by listening back to some of those notable exchanges.",
        "Why don't we start with the candidate you interviewed who has really been setting the pace for the Democratic field?",

        "Even some Democrats don't like it.",
        "I asked him why he insists on holding onto that term.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)",
        "What I mean by democratic socialism is that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we can provide a decent standard of living for all of our people.",
        "That's just the reality.",
        "That's not utopian dreaming.",
        "That is a reality.",
        "So Bernie Sanders planted his flag in that idea many, many decades ago, and has long felt out of touch with the mainstream of Democratic politics.",
        "And I tell myself - every single time I go through finals, I'm like, this is it.",
        "Like, I need a break.",
        "And I can't do this anymore.",
        "But as soon as finals is over and I get a decent score, I'm like, oh, I'm, like, ready and pumped to do this again.",
        "And that feeling of accomplishment is always (laughter) something I can't get rid of.",
        "Mirai is signed up for a full course load next semester, but a big part of her is hoping she'll have to withdraw because she'll be in Pyeongchang skating for Team USA in the Olympics.",
