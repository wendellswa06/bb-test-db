        "And Fleming says many of the government's informants were housed together in the H Unit of Colorado's supermax prison.",
        "Corroboration between two snitches who had access to the same information before they testified is hardly corroboration.",
        "In H Unit, Fleming says the inmates had access to case files and plenty of time to get their stories straight.",
        "One informant and former Aryan Brotherhood member Danny Weeks says that's exactly what went on.",

        "Like many of the informants in this case, Weeks has given inconsistent statements and, according to one bureau a prisons employee, flip-flopped his allegiances every other week.",
        "Ultimately, Weeks was not called to testify in the case, but some documents he smuggled out of H Unit were introduced as evidence.",
        "Now it's up to the jurors.",
        "They'll have to decide whether they'll trust people like Weeks, government informants with rap sheets rivaling those of the gang leaders."

        "It's become one of the world's most popular web destinations, but the social networking site MySpace has also become a target.",
        "This week a teenager in Texas sued MySpace after someone she met on the Web site allegedly assaulted her sexually.",
        "Several attorneys general are also asking the Web site to make changes because of similar cases in their states.",
        "Larry Schooler of member station KUT in Austin has more on the criticism of MySpace and what the people who run the Web site plan to do about it.",
        "So it's - there are a variety of ways that it can be gone about, and we are planning to begin measuring it in some particular ways.",
        "One example of a way that's pretty universal that we think could be used to measure, and some charities have begun to, is coming from the world of customer satisfaction surveys.",
        "But in this case it's the beneficiary or the client, asking the client themselves whether or not the services were what they needed and were satisfactory.",
        "That's one example.",
        "Can you give us others?",
        "I mean it seems like with such a wide array of charities, you would need just as wide array of ways of measuring outcomes.",
        "Yes, and I think that each charity needs to basically create a roadmap.",
        "It's been called a theory of change, but it's really like a roadmap, saying here's the problem, and here's what we want to get to, and here is how we are going to measure how we get from here to there.",
        "The evidence-based issue is if there's been research already done in a particular type of charitable endeavor, you would hope that the charity would go and look at that evidence that already exists and model itself, and at least some of the measures that it would utilize would be from that evidence-based research so that, you know, people have been on this map before, they've gone down this road before, and they know where the potholes are, and they know some of the ways to get down that road as quickly and effectively as possible.",
        "And that's part of the spirit of this evidence-based learning that charities should be relying on.",
        "This sounds almost parallel to something I've heard about in medicine, where doctors who are used to doing the same thing just because it's the way they've always done it have to be taught to study which practices actually work and do more of that and less of the things that don't.",
        "Yeah, and in fact that's also been a definition of insanity, you know, doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.",
        "So - and I think that's part of the challenge here, which is that historically charity, a lot of the work in the charitable sector has been based on gut, you know, I know I'm doing something well because I see the interactions and I see the change in my direct work.",
        "But really having a disciplined kind of, you know, research to determine what is the very best way is still very much in its infancy.",
        "Is this being spurred from within, from charities that want to do better, or from without, from donors who want to know that their money is going to the right place?"

        "But if the goal is to inspire a love of the arts, how do you measure something like that?",
        "Well, you know, the thing is that actually when you - one of the ways to think about what we call measuring results is that the further away you get from the individual to something broader, more general, the more challenging it may be to be able to measure it.",
        "But even in the example of the arts, I mean one thing that you can do is to survey the people who are experiencing that art and seeing if it's a fulfilling, enhancing experience for that person.",
        "You know, there's also studies of communities and how vital to the culture of a society the arts are and, you know, sort of measuring the results of the art.",
        "There's also, you know, there's another measure - the most rigorous measure is a randomized control trial.",
        "So you could take a community where there's a real paucity of art and then another where there's a great deal of museums and ballet companies and so forth and just look at the general satisfaction of people in those communities, as one example.",
        "So what do you say to a charity that says look, you're already judging me on what percentage of my donations are spent on something other than providing services.",
        "Now you want me to spend a bigger percent of my donations on measuring how we did at providing those services.",
        "Yeah, well actually we believe that there are three pillars in making a wise charitable giving decision.",
        "One of them is finance.",
        "Another is this results, and the third is looking at the governance of the charity.",
        "All three are relevant, but clearly, obviously, the most important are the results of the work.",
        "And so, I mean, as we're evolving our rating system, we are going to be mindful of the fact that if a charity has very robust management, performance management for results, then there's a cost associated with that.",
        "And so the overhead in that case might be higher, but it's worthwhile because the most important thing of all, the quality of its results, are there."
