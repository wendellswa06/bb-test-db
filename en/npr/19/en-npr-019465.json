        "I'm Ari Shapiro.",
        "Christmas may be over, but we're still in the season of charitable giving.",
        "This hour we're talking about how to tell where your dollars going when you give.",
        "And we want to hear from you.",
        "If you're a donor, how do you measure the impact that your money is having?",
        "800-989-8255 is the phone number.",

        "This is Mark from Nashville.",
        "Hi Mark.",
        "Hi, my name's Mark, and I support this organization called Centerstone, and they provide information to us donors periodically, and one of the one that impresses me is this in-home treatment program, which deals with kids who are victims of abuse or other kinds of trauma in their lives.",
        "And they show me statistics and reports that show that 93 percent of the kids who they get engaged with remain in their homes, and only two percent get hospitalization, and they document this through one of their agents and one of their, I don't know, one of their segments of their business that is called the Centerstone Research Institute.",
        "And then they did the same thing for, you know, children of veterans, and they showed that 100 - out of 522, 160 were prevented from being homeless, and 362 were placed in rapid re-housing, what's called rapid re-housing.",
        "And that's a program...",
        "And do those statistical data, do those statistical data make you more likely to give?",
        "Well, you know, I look at it and say, you know, this is really - you know, I've heard some of the other veterans programs that raise a lot of money, and the money doesn't go to provide services, and this Centerstone Research Institute, which provides information on what Centerstone is doing, really gives information, even gives some information from the federal government that ranked them as a mentor program that they're going to try to do their program nationally.",
        "So yeah, to me it just shows that, you know, here we're giving money, and it's not going to marketing, but it's going actually to direct service.",
        "All right, thanks for the call, Mark.",
        "Thank you very much."

        "He co-authored a book called \"\"Philanthrocapitalists: How Giving Can Save the World.\"\" He joins us by phone from London.",
        "Matthew, thanks for being on the program, and sorry for tripping over the title of your book there.",
        "Yeah, that's the trouble with writing a book with an unpronounceable title, isn't it?",
        "It's \"\"Philanthrocapitalism.",
        "Philanthrocapitalism.\"\" We have an email question here that I think you would be able to answer.",
        "Gayle(ph) writes: I've been involved in the revamping of United Way's funding model.",
        "It seems to be going on nationwide for evidence-based results.",
        "What's the origin of the movement?",

        "Thank you.",
        "Right.",
        "...usually where I've had to do this.",
        "Yes, I mean evidence-based philanthropy, it comes out of this concern that a lot of people were writing checks, and they didn't know whether the money was making a difference.",
        "And so they decided to try and measure effectively what happened to the money and not just to measure it but also to have an idea as to how it ought to look if things were going well so that they could compare what actually happened with their predictions because you can measure all sorts of things, but if you don't actually know what you really expected, then that data doesn't tell you very much.",
        "And so amongst the leading philanthropists, there's now this approach to try and have a theory of change and to set out a whole series of data that you can use to measure whether you're achieving your goals and if you're not achieving your goals then to go back to the drawing board and change the strategy and hopefully get close to achieving what social change you're trying to do.",
        "And is that because some of the billionaire philanthropists who are engaged in this effort came from the world of business, where accountability is everything?"

        "I think that's part of it.",
        "I think if you compare the charitable world with the business world, there's actually a lot more data, a lot more numbers, a lot more theories about what ought to happen.",
        "The charitable world is very opaque.",
        "It's not just at the levels individuals where we put our money in a tin or send a check off to the United Way.",
        "It's actually a lot of the big foundations, they don't really measure very well what the money is doing.",
        "And so I think these new businesspeople, people like Bill Gates came in and said look, if I'm going to give all this money away, I want to make sure the money's going somewhere useful.",
        "And so they did start to measure in a much more systematic way than we've seen before, and it has changed how they've behaved.",
        "So Bill Gates gave a lot of money initially to support the idea that if you had very small classrooms in public schools that that would improve the quality of education.",
        "And it turned out when they measured it that having a small class didn't really make a lot of difference.",
        "There were other reasons why some schools performed well, and some schools performed badly.",
        "Aside from Bill Gates, who are sort of the figureheads of this movement?",
        "Well, there's an organization in New York City called the Robin Hood Foundation, which is a bunch of hedge funders who have a very high-profile gala each year, but they have been very systematic in putting measurement, reporting back and so forth in their model.",
        "And they're behind some - they were big funders of something called the Harlem's Children Zone, which is a really comprehensive, you know, organization that takes kids from birth through their graduation from college and helps them, people who would never have a chance to get through and get a college degree.",
        "And they really put data at the heart of their model, and that's now being scaled up by the Obama administration in different parts of the country.",
        "We have an email here from somebody named Pablito(ph), who writes: Two things I worry about with increased data-driven giving: One, social service organizations will over-serve the populations that they know can demonstrate results to avoid looking like they're not doing enough for their donors; and two, funders have more power to determine what studies and ways that organizations on the ground measure their work.",
        "Sometimes the metrics that funders think up don't capture the work organizations are doing, or worse, force organizations to measure things they are not doing to get the money.",
        "He writes: In theory, data-driven philanthropy is good idea, but the question of who decides what counts and why do those with the power decide to have that power, those questions still remain.",
        "Do you have anything to - any response to those concerns?",
        "Well, I think the questions are very good questions because, you know, I think a lot of people use data to cover their backs, to make - they're operating and giving money to causes that they don't really know whether they're doing the right thing or not, and so they say give us lots of data, and they feel reassured by that, even though it's not actually helpful to anybody."

        "So the sort of data or evidence-based philanthropy I'm interested in is the kind that has a theory of social change and that is really there to help everybody in the process figure out whether they're doing the best they can and if not to flag up the problems quickly and allow them to change strategy.",
        "And, you know, I think what we're actually going to see is, as social media takes off more and more, than there's going to be more and more feedback loops, more and more information coming back, more and more sites, websites like Kiva or (unintelligible) that give a lot of information back to ordinary people as givers, as well, that create much more transparency in the system and hopefully don't allow just a few powerful people to set the agenda as to what data matters but allows a much more crowd-sourced data-gathering process.",
        "So how can the principles that billionaires and hedge fund managers are putting into place apply to those of us who are donating significantly smaller amounts than the Bill Gates of the world?",
        "Well partly it's down to our own responsibility.",
        "When I interviewed Bill Gates for \"\"Philanthrocapitalism,\"\" he basically said - I asked him this question, and he said look, everybody has to pick an area that they really care about, and they should really focus on becoming an expert.",
        "However little you're giving, you should really know about your area.",
        "And that then enables you to actually ask the right questions and to understand the data much better than if you're just constantly spreading your money around lots of causes that you don't really know a lot about.",
        "But secondly, you know, I do think more and more that the online charities are getting much better at feeding information back to you.",
        "And so if you give money to Kiva, you lend money to small farmers in Africa, you're going to get a report back on how that money's been used.",
        "Likewise if you give money to classrooms through DonorsChoose, you're going to get a whole series of letters back from the kids in the classroom, plus photographs, probably, and all sorts of information about how the money was used from the teacher.",
        "And so we're all going to be empowered in a much more, you know, visual and effective way than we've ever been before.",
        "So I actually think this is a very good moment for the rest of us starting to have some of the abilities that people with much more money have to get the kind of information we want and how our money is going to the right place.",
        "That makes no sense at all.",
        "Right, no. It has to make some sense.",
        "And we still have Ken Berger with us, who is president and CEO of Charity Navigator.",
        "And Ken, there's a question here from someone named Ron(ph), who writes: Can you measure if a program is helping to minimize a slide in the wrong direction by keeping or slowing down the speed at which the problem is getting worse?",
        "Not all problems can see positive results as much as a diminished worsening.",
        "Is that possible, Ken?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think that there can be measures in any direction: slowing things down, speeding things up, having an impact in a variety of ways.",
        "And again, I think that there is research on this in some areas, but sometimes a charity has to create a theory and a hypothesis, if you will, and then go and track it and see if indeed is it slowing down that impact or that problem."

        "You know, I just - if I could just say one other thing about an earlier comment, I think that we really are at a crossroads right now where there is - as this pressure for results from some big funders grows, there is a danger that jargon and he who does the best marketing is going to win rather than substance.",
        "And so, you know, the traditional measures of results have been counting heads.",
        "So, for example, an employment program says 100 people got employment.",
        "That's counting heads.",
        "The real measure, the meaningful measure is what we are trying to get to, and that would be how many people are gainfully employed for a period of six months, for a period of a year?",
        "And so the challenge is for us to have meaningful measures rather than the danger of jargoneering.",
        "And lastly, the public.",
        "The research shows that 90 percent of the public is very interested in finding out about the results of the work.",
        "But only about 2 percent actually go and get it, and there's a debate as to why that is.",
        "One theory, one argument is because that's the way giving always has been.",
        "It's based on emotion, and that's the way it'll always be.",
        "The second notion, which I think that Matthew and I share among others, is that it's a rational choice, to a degree, in the sense that the vast majority of charities currently do not provide public data on their results in a meaningful way.",
