        "My pleasure.",
        "It's taken me I don't know how many times to finally get on here.",
        "Well, tell us about your giving.",
        "I recently got involved with a organization called the Fender Music Foundation, and I got involved through them through a website called reverbnation.com, where I have songs posted.",
        "I'm a musician and songwriter.",
        "And there was a ad on the website talking about the Fender Music Foundation, and what they do is provide musical instruments to children who cannot afford them.",
        "And, you know, being a musician who baled hay to buy my first bass, I understand what that's like.",
        "So...",
        "And how do you measure their effectiveness?",
        "I just got involved with them within the last week.",
        "And before I signed up to do this, which I can opt out at any time if I choose, but the way that I - before I made a decision, I went on the - or clicked on the link that they provided to go to the Fender Music Foundation website and did some reading on it.",
        "And when I found out that they're, you know, using 100 percent of the proceeds towards their program and their goal, I was in right there, you know?",
        "I have...",
        "Well, let's put the question to Ken, who has extensive experience with this.",
        "What kinds of questions should Carl be asking of a charity, like the Fender Foundation, to figure out whether it's the most effective use of his charitable donations?",
        "Well, the first is what is it that they want to change?",
        "What - and if the specific change is that we want to give musical instruments to kids that otherwise would not have those instruments, that's a very - you know, that's an immediate short-term outcome.",
        "But hopefully they would say to you that they want to do something to change the quality of life, to enrich the life of this child, and then here's how we're going to try to measure that over time.",
        "You know, one of the things, though, that I will say to you is this is a movement that's in its early stages.",
        "There still is a lot of work to be done, and you're putting your finger on the arts, which, I would say, has the most distance to travel to get to those kind of measures.",
        "Same thing with advocacy groups.",
        "We're really trying to extend this to all types of charities, but I do think that there is certain intangibles there.",
        "And as you go down this road, I think we're going to be learning the answers to some of these questions together as the charities experiment and explore with the different indicators - outcome indicators, measures that they're going to use to try to track their success."

        "Wow.",

        "Ken, this seems to go far beyond an expenditure spreadsheet.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well - and, in fact - and, actually, crowdsourcing is being used in a number of ways in the whole towards measuring results as well where there's a group that we work with that crowd-sources donors and opinions on a charity and how they've experienced that charity.",
        "There's another group that's crowdsourcing the opinions of experts on the - opinions about how a charity is performing as well in addition to the clients.",
        "So crowdsourcing - I agree.",
        "I think social media and that whole realm of crowdsourcing is going to be more and more helpful in getting data.",
        "So, Ken, it's great if somebody can find a charity they believe in that has all this kind of information at their fingertips.",
        "But if they can't in the mean time, what's your advice to a donor or a perspective donor?",
        "I think that the key is in those cases where they don't have the publicly-available data, is to call them, to go to their website and to pointedly ask for that kind of information.",
        "What is the problem you're trying to solve, how do you measure to make sure you're getting there?",
        "Do you change based on if you're not meeting those measures?",
        "You know.",
        "So I think you have to directly ask that question and you should get a reasonable and thoughtful answer.",
        "If you get a dodge or it seems like, you know, more sales than content, then that should tell you something.",
        "But I think that common sense can go a long way here.",

        "And I think for those who may want to do things on the cheap or take risks - unnecessary risks that pose hazards for the crew - I think they'll certainly think twice about doing that kind of thing in light of what's happened because the penalties can be pretty severe.",
