        "Today Marko Milosevic flew to The Hague to claim his father's remains.",
        "He accused the War Crimes Tribunal of murder.",
        "At the very least, he said, because they refused his father's recent request to see medical experts in Moscow.",
        "(Through translator) I'm very much in a hurry.",
        "If I don't take him today or tomorrow, they will send him wherever they please.",
        "They're obviously in a hurry to get rid of accusations that they have had a hand in this.",
        "This is not the issue, however, because directly or indirectly, they have killed him.",

        "Alice and Celia are two girl's names that are anagrams of each other, but only the latter starts with the letter C.",
        "Can you name two girl's names that are anagrams of each other, in which both names starts with C?",
        "And the answer should be a well-mixed anagram - so dont just switch two letters in one name to get the other.",

        "The computer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is called Blue Gene.",
        "It can do over 280 trillion calculations in a second.",

        "David Turek works on supercomputing at IBM, which built the chips inside Blue Gene.",
        "It's probably on the order of a hundred thousand times more powerful than a powerful desktop system.",
        "And Blue Gene is faster than anything else on the planet.",
        "That's according to an organization called Top 500, which ranks supercomputers.",
        "It released its latest rankings at a conference in Seattle this week.",
        "Now you might think that a champion supercomputer would use the fastest, hottest chips around, but Turek says you'd be wrong.",
        "What we did with Blue Gene was something absolutely counterintuitive at the time we began the project.",
        "Most supercomputers string together a bunch of off-the-shelf processors, the kinds that power a high-end desktop.",
        "The problem is that these fast processors use a lot of power, generate a lot of heat and are hard to string together in an efficient way.",
        "So Turek says Blue Gene relies on processors that are relatively weak.",
        "Because they're smaller and because they run slower, they also are cooler and you can put more of them in a certain amount of physical space.",
        "In Blue Gene's case, there's 131,000 processors in a space the size of a tennis court.",
        "That's way more than your typical supercomputer, which has just a few hundred or a few thousand.",
        "Turek says Blue Gene's processors plus a couple of other tricks helped it unseat the previous world's champion: Japan's Earth Simulator.",
        "It's a computer the size of a football stadium designed to model things like earthquakes and weather.",
        "It was something that appeared suddenly on the scene and far outstripped what was the most powerful computer in play at that time.",
        "The Earth Simulator reigned for three years, longer than any other computer.",
        "And Turek says that worried many American scientists."

        "According to press reports, guards had found alcohol and unauthorized medication in his cell.",

        "His supporters say he was secretly poisoned.",
        "At least one Dutch toxicologist has a different theory.",
        "Milosevic was sabotaging his own health with contraband pills in an effort to get out of prison.",
        "A recent blood sample from Milosevic indicates he may have been secretly taking a drug that would neutralize his heart medication.",
        "That way he would never get better and might be let out of prison due to poor health.",
        "Professor Peter de Smet of the Dutch Pharmaceutical Association explains.",
        "One of the effects that rifamycin (ph) has is that it stimulates the enzymes in the liver and these liver enzymes are capable of making other drugs ineffective and drugs which are used concomitantly are less effective or even completely ineffective.",
        "A final toxicology report taken at the time of Milosevic's autopsy is scheduled to be released in the next few days.",
        "Although officials at the War Crimes Tribunal hope that report will put an end to speculation, it seems unlikely.",
        "Mr. Milosevic, even in death, has proved a divisive figure.",
        "No one can agree where he should be buried, much less on what actually killed him.",
