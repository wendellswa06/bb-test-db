        "We learned today of the death of Dana Reeve from lung cancer.",
        "She was 44 years old.",
        "She was the widow of actor Christopher Reeve, who was paralyzed after a horseback riding accident in 1995 and died in 2004.",
        "Dana Reeve's own diagnosis with lung cancer came less than a year after her husband's death.",
        "She was known for her work as an advocate for research into paralysis.",
        "She took over as chair of the Christopher Reeve Foundation after he died.",
        "Susan Howley is executive vice president of the foundation.",
        "Dana took a very, very great interest in the quality of life for people living with spinal cord injury.",
        "Whereas Chris was really focused on the science, Dana came at spinal cord injury from the perspective of the caregiver, the wife and the mother of Chris's son.",
        "And so her interests were really in doing everything that she could to enhance the day to day living of people with spinal cord injuries.",
        "She actually was the vision behind the foundation's quality of life grants program.",
        "And what sorts of grants have those been?",
        "What sorts of projects have been funded with that?",
        "Well, to give you an example, a quality of life grant might go to a camp for children to render it wheelchair accessible.",
        "One grant that Dana was particularly fond of was given to the Crotched Mountain School to build an accessible tree house.",
        "So these were the kinds of things that really sparked her interest and her passion.",
        "Was she also involved in, say, promoting stem cell research and things that would help --",
        "She was.",
        "She became a wonderful advocate for research and for stem cell research after Chris had died.",
        "She picked up that mantle very willingly and, I might add, very, very capably.",
        "Did she talk to you about the lessons that she learned through her experience, nearly a decade, of living with her husband who'd had this injury?",
        "Well she never talked to me personally about it.",
        "I think it's safe to say that she lived those years as Chris's wife after his injury with such grace and compassion and with an unfailingly good sense of humor and with a wonderful perspective.",
        "And so many of us remember her talking about the life after spinal cord injury and the fact that there were still so many unexpected and unanticipated joys that came to her and to Chris and to Will after his injury.",
        "And I think that in that sense she's really quite an extraordinary role model for all of us.",
        "Will is their son.",
        "He's now 13, I believe.",
        "Yes."

        "You mentioned the joys that came to them.",
        "What were some of those joys that we might not be thinking of?",
        "I, you know, my sense was always just the fact that they could still be together as a family, that they could still share intellectually and emotionally all the things that they had shared prior to Chris's injury.",
        "I mean, there's that famous line, after he was injured, where Dana evidently said to him, But you're still you.",
        "And that, to me, is a very profound message, because spinal cord injury really doesn't change the essence of a person.",
        "It changes, yes, their physical capabilities, but what makes us individuals remains intact.",
        "And I think that that's something that they both appreciated and built on magnificently for the ten years that he had after his injury.",
        "Well, Susan Howley, I'm sorry for your loss.",

        "Thank you.",

        "Dana Reeve died yesterday of lung cancer, though she was not a smoker.",
        "About one in five women diagnosed with lung cancer are non-smokers, according to the American Cancer Society.",
        "Just a few months ago, Dana Reeve had said her prognosis was looking better all the time and that she was beating the odds.",
        "But a friend tells us she grew very sick within the last two weeks.",
        "NPR sports correspondent, Mike Pesca, with us from our bureau in New York.",

        "That makes no sense at all.",
        "Right, no. It has to make some sense.",
        "Yes, I think some changes have already come about.",
        "There's definitely been more attention by film crews to speak up when they see a problem after Sarah Jones was killed.",
        "One problem that people in the industry complain about is that the fines are too minimal.",
        "OSHA fines, you know, maybe $60,000, $70,000 in a fatality and that that's perhaps not much of a disincentive for companies to change their behavior.",
        "So I think some people would argue that there needs to be more done to strengthen the fines and also to beef up enforcement because a lot of times, accidents happen and they're not reported and no one knows about them."

        "And frankly, there are tragic events that happen in Iraq on a weekly or sometimes more often than that basis.",
        "But overall now, since, say, June, the height of those attacks down by some 60 percent - civilian deaths down by some 60 percent, our casualties down, etc. So a good bit of progress in the security arena, but again, a good bit of work to do.",
        "And that's what we are endeavoring to do.",
        "Let me ask about troop levels.",
        "The current level, I think, is close to 160,000.",
        "The plan is to bring it down to around 140,000 in July.",
        "Is that still on?",
        "What we focus on is brigade combat team.",
        "And we will be taking out over one-quarter of our (unintelligible) combat power.",
        "Five of twenty brigade combat teams will have been withdrawn without replacement by the end of July, plus two Marine battalions and a Marine expeditionary unit almost the equivalent of another brigade combat team."

        "These are these 90,000 Sons of Iraq.",
        "Well, it started, as you may recall, back in October, late fall, of 2006, when a sheik in the Ramadi area of Anbar Province - which you'll recall was truly in the grip of al-Qaida, and that was at the height of their control there - he came to an Army brigade commander and asked him if it would be OK - would he in fact be supported if he decided to turn against al-Qaida because of the damage that al-Qaida had done to their community.",
        "That really was the beginning of the movement that eventually became known as the Awakening.",
        "They played a key role in the clearing and holding of Ramadi.",
        "We decided then to hire them to protect checkpoints, road networks, and so forth.",
        "And it helped the local communities enormously.",
        "No one could look at the results of what's happened and not say this has been well managed, just in terms of the numbers that you cite from last June - 60 percent reduction in attacks.",
        "But you yourself must wonder how loyal are these people to the ideas that we're trying to implant there?",
        "How long do you think you can count on these people once the Americans are gone?",

        "General Petraeus, what exactly would victory look like in Iraq?",
        "What would be for you a satisfactory outcome there?",
        "Well, Ambassador Ryan Crocker and I typically talk about an Iraq that is at peace with itself, at peace with its neighbors, that has a government that is representative of and responsive to its citizenry, that's a contributing member of the global community."

        "But of course this depends very much on making additional progress in the security arena.",
        "There is much more work to be done in terms of the provision of basic services to the Iraqi people, the Iraqi government getting its ministries functioning in a way that they are not right now, by and large, and getting the economy overall growing so that it can employ what is a fairly substantial unemployed and underemployed population.",
