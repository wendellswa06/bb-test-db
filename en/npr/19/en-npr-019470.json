        "Right.",

        "But this is a deadline for the U.S.",
        "to live up to one of its commitments, and that's keeping the sanctions lifted.",
        "That requires these periodic presidential waivers because only Congress can actually repeal the sanctions permanently, and they haven't done that.",
        "But the president can keep issuing these waivers.",
        "It has the same effect.",
        "But President Trump is now in charge of that decision, and he hasn't been very happy about it.",
        "So far he has continued with the waivers, and now it's time for him to do it again.",
        "But he has complained more and more every time, every - this comes around every three months, and he's made clear that he's liking it less and less.",
        "Do we have any insight into what decision he may come to today?",
        "Well, I mean, it's a prediction of course.",
        "Take it for what it's worth.",
        "But even critics of the deal are saying, yes, he probably will continue to waive sanctions this time.",
        "One reason might be nobody wants to be blamed for being the one to actually pull the plug on this deal.",
        "The strategy seems to be increased pressure on Iran, maybe force it to walk away.",
        "But as you said before, even if these sanctions are waived today and they're still lifted, both critics and supporters say next month there's another deadline coming up that could be critical.",

        "This was imposed by Congress, which says every 90 days the president has to certify that Iran still in compliance.",
        "He did that in July, but President Trump said at the time he didn't like it and he wanted the option to not certify next time.",
        "Well, next time is October 15th, and there are signs, including some comments from Trump himself, that he's preparing to find Iran non-compliant even though the U.N.",

        "It's kind of a scramble.",
        "Remember this is a congressional requirement not part of the deal itself, but it does trigger a 60-day window for Congress to reimpose all the sanctions that have been lifted by these waivers.",
        "In fact, there's a bill to do that.",
        "It's ready to go.",
        "It only needs a simple majority vote, likely to pass if it came up.",
        "So that wouldn't necessarily end the deal in and of itself, to answer your question.",
        "Now, Europe, Russia and China could choose to keep trading, but banking sanctions could make things very complicated.",
        "In short, the deal would be in very uncertain territory.",
        "Very uncertain territory, and so many moving parts.",
