        "You know you have this test so study for it.",
        "And I know a lot of people think the exam discriminates against students whose first language isn't English; but since English is the primary language in schools here in the U.S.",

        "If these are the facts, we're going to act on them.",

        "And so I don't know that it would be proper to say, oh, this is a new era in NCAA investigation, because they're not going to have the funding and they're not going to have the means to put together as authoritative a report as the Freeh report is.",
        "Here's an email from Tony in Portland, Oregon: While I can appreciate the monetary punishment directed against Penn State, I cannot quite wrap my mind around the forfeiture of wins.",
        "Coach Sandusky, Paterno and the other administrators involved are responsible for what transpired.",
        "But taking away all those victories punishes all those many Penn State football players who gave four years of their life to serve an institution on the football field in pursuit of excellence few ever attained.",

        "Everyone celebrated.",
        "People know what a win was and what a loss was.",
        "But the reason that they took away the wins is because it's one of the things the NCAA does.",
        "It also busts Joe Paterno down from the all-time winningest coach and Division I to some place, I think, fifth on the list.",
        "They subtract 111 wins.",
        "I'm of a couple of minds on this.",
        "I think you can make the argument that the NCAA was a little bit self-serving in taking away the wins.",
        "Now we don't have to look at that NCAA record book and see the name Joe Paterno up there.",
        "Perhaps the NCAA - as an institution, as opposed to Penn State - perhaps they're more comfortable with saying, you know, Joe Paterno, we don't have to look at that name on the list, and every time we do, think about all the horrible deeds.",
        "Then again, vacating the wins is - doesn't really have any cost, and it does make a little bit of a statement."
