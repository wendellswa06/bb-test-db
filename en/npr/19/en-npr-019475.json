        "Well, the race issue is over and now we're going to be fully equal, and the millstone will be removed from the neck of both white people and black people.",
        "But I would say that over a period of decades since then - since the Voting Rights Act and so forth was passed - both the Congress, the Supreme Court and the general public in America had kind of backed away from that commitment to going out of our way to make sure that everything is equal in a racial relationship.",

        "Legitimacy - that's strong words.",
