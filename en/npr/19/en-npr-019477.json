        "Thanks for having me, Jacki.",

        "I guess you could liken what I do to, you know, what people like Joe Buck or John Madden do for football, for baseball.",
        "Basically, I explain what's going on, kind of summarize the action for the game so viewers who are, you know, walking in and out of the room can get a sense, new viewers, hopefully, understand the game better.",
        "So, basically I'm an e-sports commentator and broadcaster.",
        "Well, I was thinking if you were speaking, it's not like baseball or football in the sense that there aren't seasons - the tournaments can happen anytime and people can participate 24/7.",
        "Yeah, and that's really the interesting thing about Dota, and most e-sports in general, is it's really a very global phenomenon.",
        "So, these teams all come together to one location.",

        "But one thing I don't quite understand is how do you get really good at this?",
        "I would say personally I think it's about 80 to 90 percent talent and 20 percent hard work.",
        "So, it's a combination of a brain game and quick reflexes?",
        "Yes.",
        "A lot of it comes down to reflexes but a lot of Dota is actually strategy.",

        "Of course, first of all we had to confirm that - because you can't really - when you're looking at the genome, there's a great risk of error.",
        "So they confirmed this with another technology and found that it was, in fact, a correct finding.",
