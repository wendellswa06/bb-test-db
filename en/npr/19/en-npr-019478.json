        "I met with a genetics counselor before I had my genome sequenced, and we went through my family history, and we talked about a bunch of diseases that we thought we might find signs of in my genome, and those included a condition called benign essential tremor, which my dad has, and some of my aunts and uncles have had.",

        "I mean, there's all sorts of things that you could find out.",

        "So there's been about 250 complaints filed under that law, and none of them have gone to court yet.",
        "So we don't - at least none that I know of, and so we don't really know how the law has been implemented so far in the courts.",
