        "This is truly a devastating loss for the more than 32,000 local fisherman, cannery workers, business owners, who'd been waiting who'd brought suit and been waiting 20 years to have this question of punitive damages resolved.",
        "They say that the economic and environmental damage that they have suffered, in effect they live in a ghost town now, is just devastating, and in fact 20 percent of the people in the class - in the original class are now dead.",
        "That's how long it has been.",
        "So this has been a dark, dark day for this.",
        "There's no way to construe this as a win.",

        "This is, as I said, Madeleine, this was decided on a Common Time Maritime Law basis.",
        "This was a very, very narrow, narrow case that really had to do with a very finite set of circumstances here today.",
        "Dahlia, the court handed down another major decision today, striking a Louisiana law that allowed the state to execute child rapists for their crimes.",
        "What can you tell us about that case?",
        "Louisiana is one of five states Alex, that have passed a law providing for murder in none homicide rape cases.",
        "In this case if the child, that was the victim that was under the age of 13.",
        "The defender in this case, Patrick Kennedy was convicted of, in fact, raping gruesomely his eight-year-old step daughter.",
        "The question for the court was whether non-homicide rape can be a capital offense, given that nobody has been executed for a non-capital crime since 1964.",
        "And the trend has been to really narrow the reach of capital punishment in this country over the last couple of decades, not to broaden it.",
        "The court in a five, four decision authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the famous swing justice with the four more liberal justices signing off, essentially struck down the law and said, the Eighth Amendment bans cruel and unusual punishment.",
        "And to kill someone for a crime which did not result in the death of a child, or was not intended to result in the death of a child, simply violates that ban on cruel and unusual punishment.",
        "I read that there were victim advocates who warned that the death penalty in these cases could actually do more harm that good.",
        "Can you explain the reasoning there?",
        "And this was something that Justice Kennedy picked up in his opinion today.",
        "He said that there were \"\"systematic concerns in the prosecutions of child rape\"\" end quote, that made this really a worry for child advocates.",
        "There's first of all the added risk of kids getting confused, he says they're not in a moral position to make those kinds of decisions about what happened to them or what they could say.",
        "There was an enormous concern that children would not report child rapes, particularly in the case of a family member who was the defendant, because they would be so afraid of the consequence, if the consequence includes the death penalty.",
        "Finally there was a real concern, and Justice Kennedy discusses this also in his opinion.",
        "If you allow for the execution of child rapists, you create a very strong incentive for the rapist to murder his victim, and therefore there will be no witnesses.",
        "And all of these things really played a part in Justice Kennedy's decision today.",
        "And how does today's decision affect the use of the death penalty in other crimes that don't involve murder?",
        "Justice Kennedy was careful to say that this was, had to do with crimes against individuals.",
        "That you couldn't have a non-homicide crime against an individual punishable by death penalty.",
        "He does, however, leave the door open, he says, for cases of treason and espionage.",
        "Not individual crimes, but larger crimes that may still be punishable by the death penalty."

        "How much is the hospital getting paid?",
        "They vary, vary - the hospitals vary a lot in the amount of money they get paid and in the volume of their care.",
        "The fourth area, the one that you're focused on, I think, today is mortality measurements, standardized mortality, 30 days after hospitalization for three conditions: heart failure, heart attacks and pneumonia.",
        "Why those three conditions?",
        "Why are they so important to focus on?",
        "You need numbers, first of all.",
        "In order to characterize a hospital, there has to be sufficient volume of patients that you can do statistical calculations.",
        "And these are very common causes of admission in the Medicare population.",
        "These are people over 65.",
        "So the data - these are conditions that affect a lot of Medicare patients, and it's sort of where the money is at the start.",

        "Now, one problem - as I understand it - in the past with releasing this kind of data at all or even getting good numbers is the fact that, you know, some hospitals might be caring for people who come in, in worse condition than other hospitals.",

        "Maybe disease prevalences are different in the two hospitals.",
        "And so, some kind of adjustment needs to be made to do what the technical people call leveling the playing field, so that you're getting comparisons that really are meaningful between hospitals.",
        "Over the years, these methods, statistical methods for adjustment, standardizing risk, have progressed a lot, and Medicare is now using those measures in their modeling that allow you to have some confidence that these are comparable populations.",
        "So, this is one of the things that I imagine hospitals have some problems with, with regard to releasing any of this kind of data, that there are variables like that that have to be accounted for.",
        "Yeah.",

        "And I think you'll see, in response to this Medicare release, different scientists taking different positions as to how trustworthy these comparisons really are.",
        "You know, in one of the articles I read, I was sort of fascinated by this example, a hospital that actually rated very highly in terms of dealing with heart-attack patients, I believe it was, but one of the things they mentioned that they learned in going through a certain process was, well, we realize that, you know, we have to put a hold on all the elevators so we can get the person on the elevator faster because it'll save us two to three minutes, you know?",
        "And that's not saying - that's not science.",
        "It's just kind of practicality and process.",
        "And I was really interested by that kind of a detail that has to be looked into and how much a difference that could make.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Think about the good news here.",
        "Suppose we could know, as we now are starting to be able to know, that there are some hospitals in the country that are doing exceptionally well on heart-attack care or heart-failure care.",
        "Well, if you're just interested in the market, you can say, well, those places should get all the business.",
        "But actually, I think the most important thing going on here is learning, which is that other hospitals, and clinicians, doctors and nurses, can inquire.",

        "How can they be so good?",
        "Let's go visit them.",
        "Let's figure this out so we can be as good as they are.",
        "And I actually think that, more than the competitive use of this information, is going to be the dynamic that makes transparency so valuable.",
        "Well, what can hospitals do to improve their performance?",
        "I mean, that's a very specific, small, little example but there must be sort of, you know, larger kinds of issues that they could look at, I would think.",
        "Well, beginning - the first step is to know your performance.",
        "So, join this movement toward transparency, welcome it.",
        "Don't resist it.",
        "You know, hospitals can suppress this information.",
        "They can opt out of some of this public reporting, and I'd be very worried about a hospital that's opting out unless it's a tiny hospital that doesn't have enough numbers.",
        "So, the first is turn the lights on, become curious about your own performance, and then become ambitious.",

        "Patients in the hospital were exceptionally sick.",
        "Things were happening in real time over the course of the day, and primary care doctors were very busy in the office.",
        "And so a new field emerged of generalist physicians, physicians who were not subspecialists but take care of all kinds of problems, who basically live in the hospital and become essentially your primary care doctor in the hospital, coordinating your care, making sure you're getting the right information and the right tests, talking to your family, talking to your primary care doctor.",
        "And then when you leave the hospital, returning you back to your primary care doctor - hopefully with a very good hand-off of information back to that doctor.",
        "There's some information that says that doing it this way improves - certainly improves efficiency of care.",
        "Patients spend less time in the hospital, and I think that's good, and some information that indicates they - that the quality of care is improved as well, as you might expect for physicians who are there all the time and focus on this, and can be there if you deteriorate in the middle of the day or in the middle of the night.",
