        "Sure, Cara.",
        "Well, some of the data are coming off hospital claims forms, where the hospital is billing Medicare, and it would be illegal, and in fact, quite risky, for a hospital to intentionally to try to deceive Medicare or anyone about this, and hospitals in general that would be caught cheating on this data would suffer some consequences.",
        "I think your point's well-taken, though, around a different issue, which is accuracy of the records themselves.",
        "We do have some information that shows that we've got a lot of work to do to make the medical records and the other source documents in hospitals better so that this data can be more reliable.",
        "By the way, the more we move toward electronic medical records, automated medical records, and hospital records, the better.",
        "So it's a concern, Cara, but I think overall, these data are just going to get better over time.",
        "But at the present time, I found through personal experience that they're not.",
        "I actually did go to the hospital rated the highest in the Philadelphia area after a serious car accident, and I was treated very badly there, misdiagnosed, mistreated, misrepresented.",
        "And to this day, they have not released my records even to my primary care physician.",
        "They also refused to contact any of my contact persons, and lied to me telling me they had.",
        "So that - because I was in the car accident in a neighboring city, and I gave them - I was conscious through the whole process, so I was able to give them all of the numbers, and I already had an advanced directive in case of emergency and a person in charge of that, and family members and co-workers, all of whose numbers I supplied to them.",
        "And they told me they had contacted everybody when, in fact, they hadn't, and I wound up on the missing persons list and being looked for by police all over my state, and...",
        "Well, let me see if the doctors can take any information that you're giving them right now and relate it to this topic about, you know, are hospitals safe, and I appreciate your calling in, Cara.",
        "Thank you.",
        "We have a long way to go.",
        "Cara's point is well-taken.",
        "This is a step.",
        "This movement toward public release of information on mortality and process, it's all adolescence in our industry.",
        "I totally sympathize with Cara's point.",
        "We need to move in a much more wholesale way toward transparency as a norm, transparency of all types.",
        "People should have absolute access to their own medical records.",
        "The idea something could happen to you in a hospital and you not know about it, I don't think is acceptable any more.",

        "Good.",
        "I'm actually a physician but as a medical student, I saw something that sort of disturbed me.",
        "It was sort of a practice of while this patient is getting real sick, or maybe this patient is ready for hospice because they're going to die soon, so let's get them sort of moved along so that the mortality doesn't get hit against our hospital, as it hit against the hospital we're transferring to, or the hospice.",
        "How does the Medicare sort of take that sort of thing in consideration?",
        "That's a good question, Steve.",
        "And I'm going to ask them - we're having a little trouble hearing you.",
        "I think you might be on a cell phone.",
        "So I'm going to ask the doctor - Dr. Wachter, why don't you take that issue?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "It's a very, very good point, that...",
        "Thanks for your call, Steve.",
        "That he makes.",
        "The crafters of the system that Medicare is using were very clever about that, and Steve raises a couple of major concerns that people have: that the system will get gamed, or a hospital will send a patient out to die rather than having it, quote, look bad, on their record.",
        "The way the system works is that death rates are calculated for 30 days after the hospitalization.",
        "I think that was a very - that was a crucial decision because A, you don't want to create an incentive system where hospitals will not make the right decision about keeping a patient in the hospital to die, if that's the appropriate place for them to get end-of-life care.",
        "And secondly, one of the things we've discovered is you can provide really good hospital care and screw things up very badly at the time of discharge, and so we often look at that period as almost a black hole.",
        "There a lot of things that have to happen in order to keep the patients safe, and one of the things the 30-day mortality rate does is causes hospitals to begin looking at its discharge process to be sure that they're making the connection back to the primary care doctor, and back to the patient's home appropriately.",
        "The other point Steve raised was, does a hospital get dinged for accepting a patient in transfer after the patient leaves the first hospital?",
        "A big academic hospital like mine often does get patients from other hospitals that have done poorly for whatever reason, and we do our best to save them.",
        "The policy decision that Medicare made was to use the first hospital as the source hospital for the mortality rate.",
        "So, it's the hospital you come into initially.",
        "If you get transferred to UCSF, or to the Mayo Clinic, or the Cleveland Clinic, or John Hopkins, those hospitals are not attributed, your mortality, hopefully you do well, but if a patient dies it's not attributed to the receiving hospital - it's the original hospital.",

        "Yes, I'm wondering - about two years ago or so, I worked for a hospital and - involved with going through our medical record, electronic medical record, and getting the data for these performance measures, and I thought at one time that they were reporting the infection rates at the hospitals, like for common procedure groups like gallbladder surgery, knee and hip surgery, things like that, but I can't find that data anymore.",
        "Is that something that's going to be reported soon?",
        "Because when I deal with family members and friends and neighbors, more people are concerned about infection rates than - they just really don't think about going into the hospital and dying.",
        "It's still kind of a surreal scene for them.",
        "Yeah, I agree with Joan.",
        "I think that's people's biggest fear right now because everybody knows a story about somebody who's, you know, gone in for some minor procedure and gotten deathly ill and maybe even died as a result of infection that they got in the hospital.",
        "Dr. Berwick?",
        "I'm with Joan and you on this one, Lynn.",
        "I think infection rates and monitoring them is one of the most important variables we can be following.",
        "There are process measures in the Medicare data set on that Hospital Compare Web site around surgical infection care.",
        "But I personally hope that we move very quickly toward public measurement and reporting of infection rates, and that involves some science, which is making sure that the measurement systems are standardized and adhering to good definitions such as CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, can provide.",
        "But I do think hospital infection rates ought to be a major target of improvement, and I look forward to increasing transparency around that issue itself.",

        "Is this something, you know, moving policy-wide toward - what Medicaid/ Medicare did in the beginning was reward those who did report their data related to performance measures versus those that didn't report their data to help, you know, kind of stimulate that process.",

        "Joan is referring to a very, a rather courageous move on Medicare's part, which is to cease paying for certain kinds of avoidable infections and avoidable complications of other sorts.",
        "This is, of course, very controversial, but I think it's going to raise the stakes, raise a lot of attention to this issue, and very importantly, I think hospital boards of trustees and governance and senior leaders in hospitals are going to be alerted by that move.",
        "And they are not alone.",
        "There are business groups that are urging not paying for things that can be avoided, and hopefully that would intensify interest in those kinds of improvements.",

        "This is from Lynn in Washington, Missouri.",
        "She says, interesting topic, but a lot of us have only one or two choices of hospitals, and the ones that have more choices need to go where the doctor practices.",

        "I mean, or, you know, in an emergency case you're going to be taken to whatever hospital they take you to.",
        "I mean, how does it - how does a consumer use this information to their advantage if they don't have much choice, Dr. Wachter?",
        "I think it's a very important point, and I think it's part of the reason that many of us are - remain a little bit skeptical that these data will be used in the same way that you choose where - what car you buy, or what washing machine you buy.",
        "Patients do have limitations, geographic limitations, or other connections to their local hospital.",
        "And I'm with Don.",
        "I think the most important thing that this transparency does is create internal pressure for change within hospitals.",
        "I can tell you that my hospital, which is a terrific hospital, has looked at these issues in a much more forceful way over the last five or 10 years - because of public reporting and transparency - than it did before.",
        "The reason that is so important is that the way we thought about medical mistakes and the quality of care up until about 10 years ago was absolutely wrong, and Don Berwick has really been the pioneer in this.",
        "We thought about these as manifestations of human failings, and that if I as a doctor committed an error, it was because I was a bad person or wasn't working hard enough.",
        "And we now know - Lynn, you brought up the point earlier about the elevator - we now know that that is the nature of health care, that to get it right has a little bit to do with how smart the doctor is, and how well-trained the nurses, but has probably more to do with does the system work well, is it reliable, does the information technology work, all those sort of pieces that none of us learned about in medical school are critically important.",
        "So, what this transparency does is force every hospital in the country to look in the mirror and say, wow, we're not as good as we thought we were, not as good as we should be.",
        "And it creates tremendous internal tension for change, and sometimes for investment.",
        "It may be that you've got to spend $20 million on a computer system, and absent this kind of transparency and scrutiny, yesterday you might not have done it and tomorrow you will.",
        "I think that's the most important thing.",
        "The consumer choice piece of this, I think, will grow over time as people get more comfortable with this, but a lot of people really are limited to one or two hospitals in their region, and they're not going to get on an airplane and fly 1,000 miles to a better hospital.",

        "I mean, in Salt Lake City, there's a couple of hospitals maybe within five, 10 minutes of each other.",
        "But the next one is 20 to 30 minutes away for a drive.",
        "I mean, would it be really worth it in an emergency situation to risk those 20 minutes, which is a very critical time, to be going to a, quote, better hospital, unquote, when you can just go to one that can take care of you and get it done?"

        "It's the longer run that I think these comparison data really help with general improvement over time.",
        "It's also important to notice that these are a little bit like baby steps still.",

        "And that shows you that there's a little bit of timidity still in the way that we're doing these comparisons.",

        "We don't know whether they are safer than they have been, I think because of Rick's very point, that the nature of hospital care has transformed remarkably in the last generations.",
        "So, when I was a resident 25 years ago, patients came in for a heart attack and stayed for two weeks.",
        "Patients sometime came in the hospital for us to try to figure out why they had a fever and they'd stay for a week or two and sometimes end up having surgery.",
        "Those patients now get diagnosed with the CAT scanner and MRI scan during their lunch break while they are seeing their doctor.",
        "And if they need antibiotics for two weeks, they don't get admitted to the hospital for two weeks of antibiotics.",
        "They get them set up at home.",
        "And so, it is a completely different landscape, and so the point that was made earlier about this kind of wonky topic that's called case-mix adjustment, which really is how we can adjust for the sickness of the patients, and the age of the patients, so that we really can have apples-to-apples comparisons.",
        "It's vitally important not just looking at one patient versus another, or one hospital versus another, but really reflecting these changes in the nature of medical care."
