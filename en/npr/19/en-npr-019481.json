        "I can make my hospital look like it's better and safer with a lower death rate if I admit more patients that aren't that sick, but we don't want to do that.",

        "We're not perfect at it.",
        "Part of the reason you get these kind of reports that say this broad band of hospitals that are called average is to say more than that, to say that hospital 1,237 really is better than 1,238.",
        "The science is not advanced enough to say that with any statistical certainty.",
        "So, I think the conservative approach they took - to call them average unless they are really out there as particularly good or particularly bad - I think was the appropriate way to start.",
        "And just to conclude, Dr. Berwick, do you find that hospitals really are - it sounds like you're both saying that this is a process that we're in, and I'm wondering if hospitals really are becoming less sort of defensive about giving out this information, or learning from this information.",
        "Slowly but perceptibly.",
