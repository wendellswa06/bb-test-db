        "Leonard Levitt is the author of the book \"\"NYPD Confidential\"\" and a blog of the same name.",
        "He says this feeling has its roots in the mayoral campaign when de Blasio ran and won on a promise to perform the relationship between the NYPD and communities of color.",

        "I'm not telling you to run to your bookie, but I'm saying it looks like that's where it's headed.",
        "Certainly, that suggests that there's going to be a majority of the court that says, there is in fact a personal individual right under the Second Amendment to bear arms.",
        "And so a personal individual right, as opposed to the idea that the Second Amendment was written for state militias to bear arms.",
        "Right, that's right.",
        "For the past few decades, the courts had commonly accepted the principle that this was not a right that flowed to individuals, but to state militias.",

        "John, welcome to the show.",
        "Why is this such a big deal in the media world?",
        "Because it allows newspapers and TV stations in the top 20 markets to combine in markets where they were not allowed to before.",
        "And they say they need to do that to be able to provide more news, more local news, and to do it more efficiently.",
        "The opponents of this move - and there are a lot of them - say that newspapers and television stations, in the 20 biggest markets anyway, aren't really in trouble.",

        "What is the argument that the industry makes in order to persuade the FCC to do this?",
        "They say that if you don't allow these combinations you will - could in essence lose voices because the stations or the newspaper might not be able to provide the same kind of coverage, the same kind of news, as they could if they combine.",
        "Obviously, some people don't accept that argument, but the argument they make is that, you know, this is the same sort of efficiency, the same sort of consolidation that you see in other places that sort of like - it's necessary in an industry, let's say newspapers, that they say is actually, you know, in decline."
