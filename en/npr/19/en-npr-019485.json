        "I do.",
        "I think Republicans are rallying around what is one of our top achievements this Congress which is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is something that I think has benefited the vast majority of Americans, helped companies give more money back to their employees, helped put more money in people's paychecks.",
        "But what you're also seeing was unemployment sink to the lowest level since 2000, 3.9 percent.",
        "We finally broke that 4 percent barrier.",
        "I think that's a very strong indication of how well the economy is doing, and it's something that Republicans will be able to take to their voters and show that Republican leadership in Washington is really benefiting the American people.",
        "You know, it's interesting that earlier this week - or rather, last week, Marco Rubio had some harsh words about the tax bill, the senator from Florida.",
        "He said, there's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been massively poured back into the American worker, and the tax bill wasn't enough to pull, say, the Republican candidate over the line in Pennsylvania in a special election that was held a couple of weeks ago.",
        "So is that evidence that the numbers may be strong but that it isn't being experienced at the voter level?",
        "First of all, that's the senator's opinion, which, you know, I'll disagree with.",
        "And I think Pennsylvania is a very unique - was a very unique case.",
        "That was a case of where you had one candidate on the Democrat side who, you know, was well-funded, was able to spend more money than a Republican candidate who wasn't quite as strong.",
        "There was a lot of unique factors there in the special election.",
        "But I think overwhelmingly what you're seeing is positive economic indicators, be it consumer confidence, wage growth, job creation.",
        "In cases where you have Republican incumbents that have actually voted for this piece of legislation, they will be able to go and talk to their constituents and tell them exactly what they're doing, exactly how they're trying to help ease the cost of living and put more money in their pockets.",
        "What we are seeing though is a lot of ads around the Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi.",
        "We're seeing a tremendous number of ads.",
        "In fact, I think one of our colleagues did a count to say that there were more ads about Nancy Pelosi than there were about the tax bill.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Well, as you saw this week, Nancy Pelosi confirmed what we knew in a conversation with The Boston Globe that if Democrats are able to regain control of the House, she is going to run for speaker.",
        "And part of her plan to set an agenda, if she were speaker, involves undoing the GOP tax plan.",
        "That's something that both her, Steny Hoyer and Joe Crowley have all said that they plan to do as a way of rallying Democrats around a message.",
        "That's their overall objective.",

        "So tell me about what Piedmont is and how black folks figure into this kind of music.",
        "Well, the Piedmont is the region right before you get to the mountains.",
        "It literally means the foot of the mountain.",
        "So it's the hilly part of North Carolina where a lot of, demographically, where a lot of black people settled.",

        "It seems that two things get left out of the history books.",

        "Well, you know, let me ask you this, Rhiannon, because I imagine this is a kind of question that you would encounter a lot because you are trained, were trained, as a very respected Oberlin Conservatory of Music, you played banjo and fiddle, and you also are a caller, as I understand it, at what's known as contra dancing or line dancing.",
        "So here you have this elite background.",
        "And now you work in a world that's some might consider country, which is a good thing, I suppose.",

        "Oh well, it does often seem to be a fact of interest to people.",
        "And I guess it is, you know, it's kind of a rare thing.",
        "But since I didn't grow up in the classical world, I grew up in the folk world and listening to country music, and you know, my grandma watched \"\"Hee-Haw\"\" and we all had a lot to watch it; and you know, so it wasn't - it's more like me coming back to my roots rather than coming from a classical upbringing, and then, you know, jumping ship.",
        "How did you get to it, Justin?",
        "I came to it from the opposite end that Rhiannon did.",
        "I actually started off as a classical musician.",
        "My mom sang opera for many years at the local opera company and also played the cello.",
        "And my sister is a classical piano player.",
        "And I played classical violin as a kid.",
        "And I got interested in it again when I got into college, and to - not the classical part of it but the folk part of it when I heard an NPR broadcast about Joe Thompson, who was our mentor.",
        "Your group makes a point of the fact that you are black.",
        "It's implied in the band's name, of course, and the group has another incarnation (unintelligible) strings.",
        "So when you go out to play, who's showing up at your shows?",
        "And when black folks do come to see you, do they say anything to you about what it means for them to see an all-black group on stage playing this kind of music?",
        "Well, it's actually a really excellent question.",
        "It's one of our main points of discussion as a group, is that, you know, the majority of audiences that we have are white.",
        "But we always have a handful of black folk who come out, who are curious, or hear about it and they come out.",
        "And they always come up afterwards and they say either, you know, I remember this from when I was little, or I've you know, they kind of like, you know, look around and go, you know, I've always liked country music, you know.",
