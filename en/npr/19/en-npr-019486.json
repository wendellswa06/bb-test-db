        "And archaeologists have found distinctive spear points from the same period at sites all over the Americas.",
        "They're called Clovis points, after the town of Clovis, New Mexico, where they were first discovered.",
        "But now a new discovery of stone chippings and blades has some scientists rethinking when the settlers first set foot in the Americas because this new cache of stone tools from Texas predates the Clovis period by thousands of years, suggesting that people were here as long ago as 15,000 years ago.",
        "That's about 2,500 years earlier than we thought.",
        "How did those earlier people get here?",
        "Can we really be sure these newly discovered artifacts are from the same earlier time?",
        "How accurate is that dating?"

        "Our OSL dates line up with the known ages of those cultures.",
        "So when we look at the dates, 13,000 to 15,000-plus, underlying Clovis, and we have artifacts down there, we have a good deal of confidence in that.",

        "How much luck is involved here?",
