        "Well, we're - it's all, you know, sort of, trickling out.",
        "And we'll see what the response is from the Clinton camp, but this is really, sort of, extraordinary.",
        "The reason it's so extraordinary is that it suggests that, you know, it's not just people showing up at rallies.",
        "You've got people doing, you know, making the most serious commitment they can make at this stage, which is to handover actual dollars.",
        "It also suggest in the news management of this - which is an important part of running for president - that the Obama camp was smart enough to sit back, wait for all the early stories about Hillary Clinton's big number and wait a few days and then sort of have their own news cycle to enjoy this.",
        "So it suggests they have also the discipline to put together this kind of money.",
        "Remember, the Obama campaign is quite new and has a lot going on.",
        "So there are some signs here about their ability to kind of do the nuts and bolts of what you have to do to run for president as well.",
        "I'll just note that in the Tribune story, the Obama people plainly were also talking to the Tribune reporters and noting that they had raised their money without going to lobbyists and political action committees, and that Senator Clinton does ask this kinds of people for money.",
        "That's right.",
        "I was with Obama yesterday up in New Hampshire, and he was asked a question by a voter there who said, you know, how can you be engaged in this kind of obscene fundraising process?",
        "And he essentially said, you know, look, I have to be able to compete.",
        "And the kind of legislation I would like hasn't passed yet, so I have to play by the old rules.",
        "But I'm not taking money from lobbyists and political action committees and that is - that's a strong answer for him for a lot of Democratic voters who don't like the - all the money in politics.",
        "You also spent some time with John Edwards' campaign up there.",
        "We'll note that he also raised money - 37,000 contributors to his campaign.",
        "That's right.",
        "And he raised 14 million in that first quarter.",
        "Edwards is doing well, and he made some distinctions with Obama - a little bit veiled, but essentially, he's been pushing this idea - when he was up in New Hampshire, he was saying, you know, to the voters, you've got to press the candidates.",
        "Don't let them just talk about hope.",
        "You want to hear policy specifics from them.",
        "So he was making, you know, kind of, a shot there at Obama.",
        "Of course, yesterday, Obama in Portsmouth held a town hall for almost two hours on health care, showing that he's got the brains to talk about policy, too.",
        "Okay.",

        "And not long ago, the vast majority of practicing archeologists in this country had very little background in the earth sciences and consequently didn't really think about the fact that okay, I have found cultural material here, I'm backing this excavation to Clovis, so that's the oldest culture, I'll just quit here, without thinking: You know, the dirt below that is just a little bit older.",

        "But if you look at the archaeological, the earliest archaeological materials that we know from the western side of the Western Hemisphere, all down the west side of North America and South America, there is a technology, a way of making stone tools that really has an Asian flavor to it.",
        "And it probably fits with genetic and other evidence that much of the ancestry of the Americas derived out of Siberia, biologically and technologically.",
        "On the other side of the continent, some of the earliest archaeological evidence that we have actually has a - and this includes Clovis - has a technological signature very similar to the Solutrean culture of primarily France and Spain that dates between about 21,000 and 16,000 years ago.",

        "A, we know that if anyone got to the Americas before about 13,500 years ago, they almost certainly had to come by boat because the entire span of Canada, from the Pacific to the Atlantic, was under an ice sheet.",
