        "So by then, people had spread from the coastal margins, all across the interior of the Americas.",
        "And the earliest discoveries of Clovis almost exclusively were at places where Clovis points were associated with skeletons of mammoths.",
        "And mammoths are very big animals, and they're very big bones.",
        "And people would spot these in gravel quarries or in erosional gullies and so forth and so on.",
        "And they would attract their attention, and they get poking around, and they would find artifacts associated with those bones.",
        "The artifacts that you've uncovered that you say are thousands of years older than Clovis, when you look at them, are there any signs on them that might point to a coming of Clovis later?",
        "That's a debatable question.",
        "I sort of lean toward the fact that most of the Freidkin artifacts don't suggest a continuity with Clovis.",
        "But the - professor Waters and his research group at Texas A&M feel like there are more similarities, and that they may have an antecedent to Clovis represented there.",
        "Well, this will be a debate that'll go on for some time, I'm sure.",
        "And I'm sure the debate's going to get thicker as you talk about that theory of coming over from North America - from Europe to North America.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "That'll add another dimension to it.",
        "I mean, that's one already controversial...",

        "Well, I'm working on a site just literally 300 meters from the Freidkin site.",
        "That's the Gault site.",
        "It is an enormous Clovis site - the largest, the most prolific Clovis site in the Western Hemisphere.",
        "I've been working on it for 20 years.",
        "We're nearing the end of our fieldwork and beginning to do the analysis.",
