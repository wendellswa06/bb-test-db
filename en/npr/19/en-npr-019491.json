        "So it looks like the big industry is starting to win, and this isn't over yet.",
        "This still has some other hurdles to go through, but a lot of folks are looking at, hey, if there's more openness to allowing big guess companies to compete, shouldn't that end up giving consumers discounts?",
        "So that's kind of the lead that I'm seeing, the overarching trend that's being put out in the media or that many supporters of this type of legislation are saying.",
