        "Yes, I do.",
        "And, you know, this is one of those things where there is really a lot at stake here, Farai.",
        "And I just - I really think the average person is not paying attention to these types of issues, but it's ultimately going to impact us in ways that we haven't even really thought of yet.",
        "I mean, the decisions that we're looking at now will end up shaping the future of the Internet for a generation - I mean, beyond our time - and so you could really come home and just have everything in one broadband connection.",

        "Well,.",
        "I think it makes them nervous when you start to intervene in their space.",
        "I mean, they don't call it MySpace for nothing.",
        "And I found that the more I try to push my way into their online life, the more they get resentful in the real world.",
        "But if I back off and I let how things are going in the real world dictate our cyber relationship, then I'm usually in good shape.",
        "OK.",
        "Now moms, though, can take it too far online.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I mean, you know, we all know the story of Laurie Drew, the stalker MySpace mom who created a fake persona so that she could, you know, sort of step in and intervene in her daughter's life, and you know?",
        "That's the one thing that I say to people when I talk to them about, you know, how should I interact with my kids?",
        "Whether they're younger or teens or even older and they're dating, and maybe they're off at college, be who you are.",
        "Don't pull a Laurie Drew because when you start to take on a fake persona, you know, all through life, online, offline, in the real world, you want to model the kind of person that you want your kids to be, and when you start lying online to investigate what's going on in their lives, not a good idea.",

        "Once she got the hang of it, she just thinks it's the greatest thing ever, and her new discovery is that she can text us all at once.",
        "And I am newly single and dating again, and I'm dating this one particular guy now, and she just - she texts me all the time with dating advice and questions asking about it.",
        "It's just the funniest thing, in the middle of work or whatever.",

        "OK.",

        "It's different for me, and my mom keeps encouraging me and telling that's totally OK.",
        "So I'm from a small town and this guy is from the same small town, so my mom, of course, knows everyone that he knows, and her latest text was about the person who massages his best friend and the scoop that she got from him and advice telling me what I should do based on that.",

        "Yeah, and it's too bad because I would have asked Katie, does she text the type of things that she wouldn't talk to her daughter face-to-face or on the phone?",
        "You know, like somebody massaging somebody.",
        "That might get a little - one of the things that I found about texting or all of these online, you know, social media interactions, I call them the car ride of the 21st century, because you know why?",
        "Nobody's making eye contact with each other and so that way, you feel a little more secure, you know what I mean?",
        "The car ride, of course, when you're coming back from the bus stop or whatever, that was the place you could talk with your parents, as long as you both stared out the windows in opposite directions.",
        "Right.",
        "Because then you could feel comfortable.",
        "You're telling your story, you're not seeing your mom's horrified reaction or you, as a mother sharing, you know, some tidbit about gee, I didn't really like what you did or how you left your room or what I know you did with your friends behind my back.",
        "And I think that, you know, it's recognized.",
        "I mean, I've heard therapists describe it that way, so that's what I think.",
        "I think that social media, especially online and texting, IMing, all of this, it's a way to replicate the car ride, except the car ride, as in Katie's case, it goes with her everywhere.",
        "Interesting.",
        "Even though they call it instant messaging, you can pause and swallow, maybe take a couple of breaths before you put out that instant reaction."

        "They're having multiple conversations.",
        "I mean literally, two, three, four, five people are IMing each other in separate conversations, and sometimes I've noticed my teen starting to talk to somebody but she's on the wrong conversation.",

        "And, like, the background was light blue, and it had, like, flowers and stuff and pictures and all kinds of really mom-related things.",
        "And it's kind of embarrassing because I don't actually even use MySpace, and she was trying really hard.",
        "And I kind of felt bad for her.",
        "Hey, though, you know, it's - that, though, is impressive because a lot of people complain, oh, MySpace - for those, you know, Facebook is easy for us old-timers who just can't put a whole lot of new thoughts in our head.",
        "And you know, MySpace, there's HTML, there's CSS, cascading style sheets, so it sounds like she tried.",
        "She did.",
        "But I taught her how to use email because that's how I really talk.",
        "And I - they really, my parents both have really gotten on board with technology now that I've, you know, kind of tutored them in it.",
        "And Matthew, it sounds from what you're saying is it's made, well, an estrangement a little bit less estranged.",
        "It has, yeah.",
        "Because they still call me for tech support.",
        "That's great, Matthew.",
