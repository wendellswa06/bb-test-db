        "In honor of my graduation and artistic accomplishments, my mother had made a MySpace page displaying artwork I'd done for corporate offices in San Francisco, artwork I'd done for hometown art fair competitions in my youth, language art high school project posters, as well as photos of me as a child, and so forth.",
        "Needless to say, I was not pleased with the impact this MySpace page might have on my professional image, and quite quickly asked her to dismantle her baby book tribute.",

        "And while the children have the same thing back, you know, part of growing up is moving away from that.",
        "So I think these emails sort of show the negotiation between, you know, the expression of love between mother and child.",
        "The negotiation.",
        "That's an interesting word.",
        "Well, I mean, I think, you know, I think most children love their parents, but it can be a little more fraught, because they're - you know, especially in their, you know, early 20s, they're trying to grow apart.",
        "And so they can't rely on their mothers anymore in the same way, maybe, mothers still want them to rely on them.",
        "Do you think, Doree, that there might be an interesting book written by mothers about the emails and IMs they've gotten from children?",
        "Definitely.",
        "And, you know, sometimes people will forward us exchanges that they've had with their mothers, and we haven't really been posting those because we've been concentrating on emails from moms.",

        "And that's the newest tactic they have, you know, watch out, you might get raped and stuff.",
        "I don't know where she gets these emails from.",
        "I think maybe she gets it from other moms send her, and then she sends it on to us.",

        "So I take it that that caused some eye rolling when you received it.",
        "Yeah, it does.",

        "I grew up in the generation where you had to take the phone call.",
        "And there wasn't, you know, screening, so you knew who was on the other end.",
        "So you got your mother when you were thinking that your boyfriend was going to call.",
        "And then there would be half an hour where you would either have to cradle the phone on your shoulder, but you really didn't want to listen, because it's - she was basically screaming at you in all caps.",
        "So it's a terrific world in which you can see that email, and you can just, sort of, you know, put it into the delete pile, and so there you go.",
        "I mean, you have to skim it, obviously, because she's going to ask you, did you catch my email?",
        "And you say, yes, but - oh, it's such a better world for you!"
