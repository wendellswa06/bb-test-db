        "You know, like somebody massaging somebody.",
        "That might get a little - one of the things that I found about texting or all of these online, you know, social media interactions, I call them the car ride of the 21st century, because you know why?",
        "Nobody's making eye contact with each other and so that way, you feel a little more secure, you know what I mean?",
        "The car ride, of course, when you're coming back from the bus stop or whatever, that was the place you could talk with your parents, as long as you both stared out the windows in opposite directions.",
        "Right.",
        "Because then you could feel comfortable.",
        "You're telling your story, you're not seeing your mom's horrified reaction or you, as a mother sharing, you know, some tidbit about gee, I didn't really like what you did or how you left your room or what I know you did with your friends behind my back.",
        "And I think that, you know, it's recognized.",
        "I mean, I've heard therapists describe it that way, so that's what I think.",
        "I think that social media, especially online and texting, IMing, all of this, it's a way to replicate the car ride, except the car ride, as in Katie's case, it goes with her everywhere.",
        "Interesting.",
        "Even though they call it instant messaging, you can pause and swallow, maybe take a couple of breaths before you put out that instant reaction.",
        "Well, it's a funny thing about instant messaging because instant messaging isn't so instant and it isn't so one-on-one.",
        "I mean, if you ever watched a teenager's habits, or a young adult's habits with IM, they're not just having one conversation with you.",
        "They're having multiple conversations.",
        "I mean literally, two, three, four, five people are IMing each other in separate conversations, and sometimes I've noticed my teen starting to talk to somebody but she's on the wrong conversation.",
        "Oh, you really have to watch that.",
        "Ooh, yes, and don't ever hit the send-all button.",

        "And I think the thing I was most impressed with was that my mom actually designed her MySpace profile.",
        "And, like, the background was light blue, and it had, like, flowers and stuff and pictures and all kinds of really mom-related things.",
        "And it's kind of embarrassing because I don't actually even use MySpace, and she was trying really hard.",
        "And I kind of felt bad for her.",
        "Hey, though, you know, it's - that, though, is impressive because a lot of people complain, oh, MySpace - for those, you know, Facebook is easy for us old-timers who just can't put a whole lot of new thoughts in our head.",
        "And you know, MySpace, there's HTML, there's CSS, cascading style sheets, so it sounds like she tried.",
        "She did.",
        "But I taught her how to use email because that's how I really talk.",
        "And I - they really, my parents both have really gotten on board with technology now that I've, you know, kind of tutored them in it.",
        "And Matthew, it sounds from what you're saying is it's made, well, an estrangement a little bit less estranged.",
        "It has, yeah.",
        "Because they still call me for tech support.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "And what you do is you need to earn points to feed it and to get other accessories.",

        "So it's a little bit of a networking at the same time.",
        "Well, here's a question.",
        "Have you ever thought about buying your own - of course, letting her know that you're doing this, but buying your own Webkins stuffed animal, having your own presence online and interacting with her on that way?",
        "Or would she find that creepy?"
