        "She's lost her job recently.",
        "And the most recent blog she posted was a pictorial expression of how she's doing right now, which was a little bit upsetting, but it was also kind of great because I knew that she needed a little more mothering, a little nurturing.",
        "But the downside of it is whenever we talk, I have to be really careful not to say something.",
        "So I hear you're, you know, suffering, or whatever, or you did this the other night because I got that information from her blog and not from her directly.",
        "So I get confused sometimes.",
