        "Well, I mean, I think, you know, I think most children love their parents, but it can be a little more fraught, because they're - you know, especially in their, you know, early 20s, they're trying to grow apart.",
        "And so they can't rely on their mothers anymore in the same way, maybe, mothers still want them to rely on them.",
        "Do you think, Doree, that there might be an interesting book written by mothers about the emails and IMs they've gotten from children?",
        "Definitely.",
        "And, you know, sometimes people will forward us exchanges that they've had with their mothers, and we haven't really been posting those because we've been concentrating on emails from moms.",
        "But the responses from kids are very interesting.",
        "And I think, you know, a lot of times, kids are a little more petulant than they probably think they are.",

        "And that's the newest tactic they have, you know, watch out, you might get raped and stuff.",
        "I don't know where she gets these emails from.",

        "So you got your mother when you were thinking that your boyfriend was going to call.",
        "And then there would be half an hour where you would either have to cradle the phone on your shoulder, but you really didn't want to listen, because it's - she was basically screaming at you in all caps.",
        "So it's a terrific world in which you can see that email, and you can just, sort of, you know, put it into the delete pile, and so there you go.",
