        "Tony Snow first joined the White House staff under President Bush's father, George H.",
        "W.",
        "Bush, in 1991 as a speech writer, then became a newspaper and NPR commentator where he was a critic of President Clinton.",
        "In this puckish commentary from 1993, he was urging a balance between work and life.",
        "(Soundbite of NPR commentary)",
        "For seven months, the White House has looked like a college campus at exam week with kids gobbling NoDoz like candy, cramming facts and figures into mushy tired skulls, and surrendering the ability to perform any mental function higher than rote memorization.",
        "Tony Snow knew something about facts and figures.",
        "He grew up in Ohio, the son of a high school teacher and an inner city nurse.",
        "After graduating from Davidson College in North Carolina, he taught school in Kenya.",
        "He later became an editorial writer at several papers before becoming the editorial page editor of the conservative Washington Times.",
        "In 1996, Fox News made its debut and so did Snow as the moderator of its Sunday's issues show, a position he held for six years.",
        "In 2006, President Bush named him to replace press secretary Scott McClellan whose credibility was shot with reporters when it was revealed he'd been misled into defending White House aides Karl Rove and Lewis \"\"Scooter\"\" Libby on the Valerie Plame leak case.",
        "Snow was a far more assertive and comfortable presence, a conduit for the president to conservatives, but also to his former peers in the press core.",
        "In this interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep on Morning Edition, Snow bristled at the idea he was holding anything back from reporters.",
        "(Soundbite of NPR interview)",
        "My view is a press conference actually ought to be a place where we transmit as much information as we can and make news.",
        "I understand that everybody out there has the same objective which is to try to write news stories and get good information.",
        "Quite often the drama in the press room has to do with the reporters knowing that there is a question that the press secretary cannot answer, but asking it anyway.",
        "Snow had been diagnosed with colon cancer before going to work at the White House.",
        "But in early 2007, a growth in his stomach proved cancerous.",
        "After months of treatment, he announced he was returning to private life."

        "Well, that's true.",
        "But it's childish for Republicans to think they're going to pass an immigration bill and it's going to heal their problems with Latino voters.",
        "The history with the 1986 amnesty was, you know, Ronald Reagan signs that thing and actually the Republican share of the Latino vote goes down.",
        "So, I think more fundamentally the party should be focused on how to appeal to working-class voters of all races and all ethnicities.",
        "The president has suggested, intimated that he'd be willing to let go of a special pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants.",
        "If this is something House Democrats start to warm up to, would things change for the GOP?",
        "Would this be a more palatable alternative moving forward?"

        "Not for me, 'cause it's really not the most important question.",
        "The amnesty of illegal immigrants will come when they're allowed to stay here and work here legally.",
        "And then also, I think, politically, even if you pass a bill that has no path to citizenship and the president signs it into law, Democrats will immediately will start, understandably, pounding away at Republicans, saying, look, you want to have this permanent class of basically second-class citizens that you're blocking from citizenship in this country and, you know, how is that going to go over with Latino voters if that's the Republican position?",
        "So, I think it's a mistake to make such a big deal of the path to citizenship now.",
        "And that even if Republicans got their way on that, it wouldn't be sustainable over the long run.",

        "A bit of history is informative here.",
        "In 1976, John Moore went to UCLA to be treated for leukemia.",
        "Leslie Wolf at the Georgia State College of Law says Moore's doctors gave him good medical care.",
        "But they also discovered there was something interesting about his cells and created a cell line from his cells without his knowledge.",
        "And what sort of complicated it even more is they asked Mr. Moore to travel down from his home in Seattle to LA multiple times for seven years to get additional cells without telling him they had this commercial interest in his cells.",
        "Moore sued and eventually reached a settlement with UCLA.",
        "But Mr. Moore certainly felt betrayed through the process.",
        "Some of the same issues are surfacing again as university researchers realize that they are sitting on a valuable trove of digital medical records such as CT scans and are starting to use these records to develop commercial products.",
        "In a certain sense, whether it's cells or bits and bytes, it's all information about an individual at some level."

        "That's usually not how it's done.",
        "At many research hospitals, patients routinely sign a paper in that huge stack of admission paperwork giving permission for the institution to use their personal data for research.",
        "For someone to sign away the rights in perpetuity for their data to be used for all possible research applications in the future - that's something that I think would deserve a lot of scrutiny.",

        "But that's exactly what happens at Johns Hopkins hospitals.",
        "And it's approved by the university's ethics committees, says Dr. Karen Horton, head of radiology.",
        "One major protection is that the data they are using, for example, to develop artificial intelligence tools is stripped of all personal information.",
        "So there's no risk to a patient to have their images used to train the computer.",
