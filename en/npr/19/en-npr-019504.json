        "Yeah.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, we would see millions of jobs lost, not just in Michigan, but across the country.",
        "I mean, if you liquidated General Motors and Chrysler, if they had no help and to go completely under and sell their assets, what would this mean for the rubber industry or the plastics industry or the steel industry or the electronics industry or the glass industry - all of which feed into the automotive industry.",
        "I mean, we produce, as Americans - this automobile is the most technologically advanced, mass-produced product in the world.",
        "So we would have given up our ability not just to produce cars for ourselves, but what if we need this manufacturing base to produce other products?",
        "A lot of the suppliers to the auto industry also supply other industries, and so you would take them down with you.",
        "So the bottom line is even though this is an expensive proposition, and it's expensive proposition to the taxpayers, the taxpayers will get their money back, and that's what the Obama administration is committed to.",
        "They don't want to be running these car companies.",
        "The taxpayers don't want to be running these car companies.",
        "We want to have a quick entry and put them on the path to competitiveness globally and allow for the taxpayers to be repaid.",
        "You really believe the taxpayers are going to get their money back?",
        "That's the plan.",
        "I mean, I can only tell you - I believe that's what everybody's intent is, and I have been surprised thus far at how much the predictions have come true, at least on the Chrysler side.",
        "So I'm hopeful that we can see that same kind of efficiency and predictions coming true with respect to General Motors.",
        "Governor Granholm, thank you so much for your time today, obviously a momentous day in the history of the state of Michigan and the industrial history of the world.",
        "Yeah, it sure is.",
        "It sure is.",
        "Thanks, Neal, for having me on.",
        "Governor Granholm, with us today from her office in Lansing.",
        "And, well, we're going to continue our conversation.",
        "As she talked about the sacrifices for autoworkers, for GM's stockowners, for GM's bond owners, for, well, all kinds of people around the country who are taxpayers - was it worth it?",
        "Is it worth it?",
        "Give us a call: 800-989-8255.",

        "It's my pleasure, Neal.",
        "And talk about just an extraordinary day.",
        "One could never imagine the idea of General Motors declaring bankruptcy.",
        "This afternoon, when Fritz Henderson, who's the chief executive of General Motors, came into the room for the big press conference, he said that he'd passed a portrait of Alfred Sloan, the legendary General Motors president, and he said he asked himself what would those past leaders of General Motors do in his situation.",
        "Well, those past leaders of General Motors were never in his situation.",
        "They never had to make a call like this, to go into bankruptcy, and really, in the end, it wasn't Mr. Henderson's call.",
        "It was President Obama's call.",
        "And he was talking - you were, in fact, asking him a question about what's his role going to be and indirectly, what's the role of the president of the United States going to be.",
        "The president, of course, fired his predecessor.",
        "Are the calls going to be made in Washington, D.C., or in Detroit?",
        "It seems like it will be something of a team effort because Mr. Henderson was trying to make the point that no one will tell us whether to build a four-door or a coupe, but people will be looking at the investments that they make.",
        "And if, for example, they decide to continue a family of six SUVs in the face of new fuel-economy standards, someone might get tapped on the shoulder by the Treasury Department, said, we don't think that's going to comply with federal fuel standards.",
        "So you might want to rethink that.",
        "I don't think anyone in Washington wants to come to Detroit and sit in GM's offices and run the company, but there will certainly be oversight.",
        "Nevertheless, there could be questions about, you know, it might be cheaper to manufacture whatever car it is in Mexico or in China instead of in Michigan.",
        "Well, it's a policy call.",
        "It's a political call.",
        "And, in fact, when General Motors first unveiled the restructuring plan that it hoped to go forward with in bankruptcy, it did say that it wanted to build more vehicles in China and more vehicles in Mexico.",
        "And the United Auto Workers Union said no, you need to be building small cars in the United States.",
        "And indeed, General Motors has said that they will pick one of its factories to build a small car, one in either Wisconsin, Michigan or Tennessee.",
        "And as you look at this, the shareholders now, including the U.S.",
        "Treasury, but they include Canada and the province of Ontario, as well, are they going to be putting their autoworkers first at the top of that list of uninsured creditors?",
        "You know, it brings up a whole lot of questions here, because between the United States and Canada and Ontario, 72-and-a-half percent of General Motors will be owned by governments.",
        "And when governments own something, they tend to want to get priority for their considerations.",
        "And so for Canada, that will be jobs in Canada.",
        "For the United States, that will be jobs in United States."

        "Why?",
        "Because the German car offered better quality, better handling, more fun to drive and safer, better fuel economy and retained greater resale value.",
        "Until that turns around, someone else can buy their cars.",
        "It was a point addressed at a news conference today by GM President Fritz Henderson in New York.",

        "Hi, thanks for taking my call.",
        "I'd like to say the sacrifice we're making, I don't feel it's necessary because we do have private-sector companies - Ford, Toyota, Honda - that are making those sacrifices already in the private sector, doing what they have to do to survive.",
        "And yet we're just talking about bailing out this one company.",

        "To be fair, probably two if you count Chrysler, but Mickey Maynard, he's got a point.",
        "Well, I would probably make the same point, that consumers have a choice and the ultimate test of this bankruptcy will be whether both General Motors and Chrysler can get people to buy their cars again.",
        "You know, General Motors said something today that I hadn't heard before.",
        "They said they have 400,000 contracts out there.",
        "So in other words, it's not just parts suppliers.",
        "It's stationery makers.",

        "So it really does touch a lot of people.",
        "On the other hand, nobody buys a car because they know the person who prints the annual report for General Motors.",
        "They buy a car because it meets their family's needs.",
        "In other words, Ford has those same contracts, and they're going to have to compete against almost a public entity these days.",
        "And that's a big concern.",
        "And I think people at Ford have been looking at this and looking at this because they actually did get the savings from the United Auto Workers, and they got them first, before General Motors and Chrysler.",
        "So on the union side, they are going to save some money.",
        "On the other hand, that's not the only part of building a car.",
        "In fact, labor's really a tiny portion of it, and Ford will have to work very hard to make sure that it can stay competitive in the face of the savings that these other two companies are getting.",

        "And so what I would like to know before I can make an informed decision on whether it's been worth it is at some point in my life and my wife's life as taxpayers, do we have - actually have shares of GM that at some point, when GM hopefully turns itself around, we could hold onto, sell, trade or collect dividends from?",
        "Or is it just politic speak?",
        "Well, those shares are being held for you by the Treasury Department.",
        "And the way it was described today was that even when General Motors comes out of bankruptcy, its stock won't return to the stock exchange just yet.",
