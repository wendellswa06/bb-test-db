        "Well, you know, on Friday, I actually did a little story for our blog called DealBook, and we looked at General Motors' closing price on Friday.",
        "It was $.75.",
        "Back in 2000, it was about $70 a share, and this was a stock that people bought as a long-term investment.",
        "You know, they used to say that widows and orphans owned General Motors stock, but so did a lot of pension plans and other retirement funds, and it was seen as such a safe investment.",
        "Now the recovery plan, the restructuring plan, assumes that when General Motors comes out of bankruptcy that its stock will sell for something like 10 to $12 a share.",
        "Well, Ford's stock is I believe below $6 a share.",
        "So that's kind of a bet on the future there, that GM would be worth that much.",
        "And indeed that the economy will recover, and people are going to be interested in buying new cars.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "And this idea that I think they're talking about, well, we could break even if there are 10 million cars a year sold, we might be able to make a profit, what, about 12 or 13?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "And, you know, the market right now, it's about 9.3 million at the - they call it the selling rate.",
        "So if you take where sales are now and transpose them onto a whole year, then the selling rate is about 9.3 million vehicles, and it's the worst in over a quarter century.",
        "So what GM is saying is that even things just pick up a little tiny bit, that they'd break even, and then if they get to slightly better, say 20 percent better, that they would be making money again.",
        "And you know, they weren't making money at 17 million sales.",
        "So that was with all of the debt, all the structure before the contracts had been rewritten.",
        "So what they're saying is we'll get rid of all that detritus, and we'll be a slimmer company, and we'll come out without much debt, and then we'll be making money.",
        "Let's get Vanessa on the line calling from I-75 in Georgia.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "I'm on a little road trip from Valdosta back home to Macon with my children.",
        "You know, nobody likes that we're having to have the government get involved in this at all.",
        "But the fact of the matter is is that if the government does not get involved at this point, the reach of the consequences if these auto industries were to fail, then you know the domino effects.",
        "The glass industry fails.",
        "The steel industry fails, and so on and so forth.",
        "It costs the government so much more money if that happens because then you've got all these people who are out of jobs."

        "Then we're talking about, you know, unemployment benefits.",
        "We're talking about, you know, Medicaid goes up because there's, you know, all these people that are now on Medicaid because they don't have health insurance, and they're in the poverty level and so on and so forth.",
        "Nobody likes this.",
        "But it's just like, you know, you don't like it if you have a small leak in your house.",
        "But if (unintelligible), the next thing you know you're having this huge problem where, you know, the floor is rotted out.",
        "Well, nobody wants to have a rotted-out floor, either.",
        "The best thing to do is cut it off now and fix it before the consequences go so much further.",
        "Mickey Maynard, this is a point that Governor Granholm was making, as well.",
        "Yes.",
        "And this is the point that the Obama administration and the Treasury make as well, is that if they don't spend the $50 billion or more, probably, to bail out General Motors, that it will cost hundreds of billions of dollars in the losses of tax revenue, the losses of jobs, things like that.",
        "And, you know, that's a valid point.",
        "And it just reminds me of the fact that back in the '80s, the Detroit carmakers were critical of the Japanese government because Japan had an industrial policy, and Japan did support its car companies.",
        "And now here we are 25 years later, and really, we do have the equivalent of industrial policy.",
        "It's to support General Motors and Chrysler through bankruptcy so that they can emerge and be successful again.",
        "Vanessa, drive carefully.",
        "What car are you driving, by…",
        "Oh, I'm not driving, but my father is with us, (unintelligible).",
        "And it's a Chrysler, you know, good old family minivan.",

        "Here's an email, and getting a lot of these: I would ask if the CEOs and others in top jobs, will they feel the pain as much as individual workers?",
        "I think not.",
        "I'm sure that these upper-management people have been and will continue to be well protected during this restructuring of General Motors - that one from Les in Livonia, New Hampshire.",
        "Well, they are getting paid, but one of the ways that these executives have been compensated through the years is with stock options.",
        "And, in fact, just before the bankruptcy, Bob Lutz, who is a veteran executive at General Motors, sold all of his GM shares, and he said, you know, I couldn't afford to leave money on the table.",
        "So I'm sure that the executives are very anxious to see GM come back into the public as a public company so that someday their stock in the new General Motors will be worth something again.",
        "And this from Michael in Miami: The idea of every person having a personal car precludes true energy independence.",
        "GM should fail, and the tax money should be spent on mass transit such as rail.",
        "We actually wrote a story about that this weekend in the Times about the fact that it's so difficult to predict whether the car market will come back, roaring back, to where it once was.",
        "Because even Mr. Henderson said today that people are taking into account the idea that gas prices might go up.",
        "Now, in Michigan, they're getting close to $3 a gallon.",
        "They're not that expensive in places like Pennsylvania and New Jersey, but they are going up again and they may go up as oil prices go up.",
        "So something to keep…",
        "Sixty-three or $68 a barrel, I think today.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And, you know, that's not $100 a barrel, but it's certainly higher than it's been and it's something to keep in mind.",
        "And also, as I discovered, you know, as people use their home equity to buy cars, they no longer have the home equity.",
        "People are deciding, do I really need three cars, can I get by with two, one or maybe no car, and all these car sharing programs have come up in basically urban centers and college towns.",
        "But it is something that everyone in the industry is looking at, do we even have the demand anymore for as many cars as we once sold or will we shake out at a lower level.",
        "And another question, Mickey Maynard, and we heard the president, we heard the president of General Motors, we just heard Governor Granholm tell us - the alternative to this was liquidation.",
        "Was that the only other alternative?",
        "I think - well, at the end of last year when things are really spiraling downward, it might have been liquidation.",
        "Now, what has happened was, General Motors originally went to the Treasury around the time that the rescue money, the TARP funds were created and basically said, please give us $25 billion.",
        "And Secretary Paulson said, no way, go to the banks."

        "Now, the question is, who's responsibility is it to clean up the mess?",
        "And I kind of suspect that had there been enough pressure, that banks might have come through with some financing so that both these companies could have reorganized, but we'll never know.",

        "I have covered a number of bankruptcy filings by part suppliers, steel makers, airlines.",
