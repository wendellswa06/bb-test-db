        "And, Frank, thank you as well for being there today.",
        "Always happy to do it, man.",
        "We're going to start the program today with a look at national politics as the primary season kicks off in earnest.",
        "Four states are holding primaries on Tuesday.",
        "So we thought this was a good time to check in on how Republicans and Democrats are seeing their respective strategies ahead of the November midterms.",
        "By now, you've certainly heard many pollsters predict that Democrats will retake control of the House of Representatives.",
        "We'll hear from a Democrat in a few minutes.",
        "But first, Republican Jesse Hunt is with us.",
        "He's the press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee.",
        "Their job is to elect as many Republicans as possible to the House.",
        "He was kind of to join us in our studios in Washington, D.C.",
        "Jesse Hunt, thanks so much for joining us.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Do you see an overall message taking shape for Republicans this year?",
        "I do.",
        "I think Republicans are rallying around what is one of our top achievements this Congress which is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is something that I think has benefited the vast majority of Americans, helped companies give more money back to their employees, helped put more money in people's paychecks.",
        "But what you're also seeing was unemployment sink to the lowest level since 2000, 3.9 percent.",
        "We finally broke that 4 percent barrier.",
        "I think that's a very strong indication of how well the economy is doing, and it's something that Republicans will be able to take to their voters and show that Republican leadership in Washington is really benefiting the American people.",
        "You know, it's interesting that earlier this week - or rather, last week, Marco Rubio had some harsh words about the tax bill, the senator from Florida.",
        "He said, there's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been massively poured back into the American worker, and the tax bill wasn't enough to pull, say, the Republican candidate over the line in Pennsylvania in a special election that was held a couple of weeks ago.",
        "So is that evidence that the numbers may be strong but that it isn't being experienced at the voter level?",
        "First of all, that's the senator's opinion, which, you know, I'll disagree with.",
        "And I think Pennsylvania is a very unique - was a very unique case.",
        "That was a case of where you had one candidate on the Democrat side who, you know, was well-funded, was able to spend more money than a Republican candidate who wasn't quite as strong.",
        "There was a lot of unique factors there in the special election.",
        "But I think overwhelmingly what you're seeing is positive economic indicators, be it consumer confidence, wage growth, job creation.",
        "In cases where you have Republican incumbents that have actually voted for this piece of legislation, they will be able to go and talk to their constituents and tell them exactly what they're doing, exactly how they're trying to help ease the cost of living and put more money in their pockets.",
        "What we are seeing though is a lot of ads around the Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi.",
        "We're seeing a tremendous number of ads.",
        "In fact, I think one of our colleagues did a count to say that there were more ads about Nancy Pelosi than there were about the tax bill.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Thank you."

        "Longer-term, also like life, folks busied themselves with unconvincing expressions of confidence--`The next catalog is our best ever,' that kind of thing.",
        "But whenever thoughts strayed to the more distant future--and maybe this was the most lifelike aspect of all--no amount of bluster could hope to disguise a classic case of the screaming fantods.",
        "Beset by stagnant sales and aging readers, the whole profession of publishing resembled nothing so much as 25,000 castaways, beached on the east bank of the Hudson River tending their signal fires and hoping for somebody--Oprah?",
        "Google Print?--somebody to rescue them before the breadfruit runs out.",
        "The October prospects of a new memoir from Joan Didion and novels from such names as Zadie Smith, Salman Rushdie and Wendy Lesser gave Book Expo participants something to look forward to.",
        "But underneath all the hoopla, attendees' spirits proved as autumnal as their catalogs.",
        "Or maybe that's just three days of wine and cheese talking.",
        "The New York Times certainly preferred to whistle a happy tune, opening the convention with a piece celebrating an 8 percent rise in consumer spending on books over the last three calendar years.",
        "It fell to the Associated Press to emphasize that it's easy for consumers to spend 8 percent more on books just so long as books keep costing at least 8 percent more than they used to.",
        "In other words, folks aren't buying more books.",
        "They're just shelling out more for them.",
        "Seen in this light, the book sales glass is not only half empty, but looking decidedly on the brackish side.",
        "And readers are buying fewer different books.",
        "As conglomerates like Wal-Mart come to dominate a larger and larger slice of the book market, the much smaller selection in stores like theirs has real consequences for the biodiversity of American thought.",
        "On Saturday the audience at a C-SPAN 2 panel laughed when I suggested that no bookstore should stock more than a single copy of any one book at a time.",
        "But is that really any more absurd than the alternative that we're fast approaching, when stores will finally stock thousands of copies of only one book?",
        "Which brings us to Oprah's recent choice of three William Faulkner titles--\"\"As I Lay Dying,\"\" \"\"The Sound and the Fury\"\" and \"\"Light in August\"\"--for her Book Club this summer.",
        "Why three books rather than the usual one?",
        "Different explanations are making the rounds, but I'm partial to the most obvious, if least invoked theory.",
        "How else could publishers hope to make $29.95 off a boxed set of three classics, any two of which can be found in most half-decent libraries or used-book stores?",
        "I'm not saying Oprah cares whether publishers make a mint off her picks or not.",
        "But such successes certainly reinforce her position as the premier literary tastemaker in America since Clifton Fadiman reigned over the Book of the Month Club.",
        "Money is nice but power is nicer.",

        "Last summer, CNN's top news executive, Mark Whitaker, told NPR his network has strayed off course.",
        "A big challenge for CNN now is to really decide who its audience is and to really focus on doing the best job possible for that audience, and not think that it can be all things to all people.",
