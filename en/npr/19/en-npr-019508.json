        "And it is true that we've got a huge number of them, and so this is why we haven't totally hit bottom yet because the ripple effect of General Motors going dark for three months will be felt very deeply in the supplier community, as they have been feeling it through Chrysler.",
        "But I suppose the flipside of that is we do know that the Chrysler experience did prove to be quick, if in fact they do emerge from bankruptcy this week.",
