        "It's my pleasure, Neal.",
        "And talk about just an extraordinary day.",
        "One could never imagine the idea of General Motors declaring bankruptcy.",
        "This afternoon, when Fritz Henderson, who's the chief executive of General Motors, came into the room for the big press conference, he said that he'd passed a portrait of Alfred Sloan, the legendary General Motors president, and he said he asked himself what would those past leaders of General Motors do in his situation.",
        "Well, those past leaders of General Motors were never in his situation.",
        "They never had to make a call like this, to go into bankruptcy, and really, in the end, it wasn't Mr. Henderson's call.",
        "It was President Obama's call.",
        "Unidentified Man #2: ...chips and water.",
        "For how long?",
        "And he was talking - you were, in fact, asking him a question about what's his role going to be and indirectly, what's the role of the president of the United States going to be.",
        "The president, of course, fired his predecessor.",
        "Are the calls going to be made in Washington, D.C., or in Detroit?",
        "It seems like it will be something of a team effort because Mr. Henderson was trying to make the point that no one will tell us whether to build a four-door or a coupe, but people will be looking at the investments that they make.",
        "And if, for example, they decide to continue a family of six SUVs in the face of new fuel-economy standards, someone might get tapped on the shoulder by the Treasury Department, said, we don't think that's going to comply with federal fuel standards.",
        "So you might want to rethink that.",
        "I don't think anyone in Washington wants to come to Detroit and sit in GM's offices and run the company, but there will certainly be oversight.",
        "Nevertheless, there could be questions about, you know, it might be cheaper to manufacture whatever car it is in Mexico or in China instead of in Michigan.",
        "Well, it's a policy call.",
        "It's a political call.",
        "And, in fact, when General Motors first unveiled the restructuring plan that it hoped to go forward with in bankruptcy, it did say that it wanted to build more vehicles in China and more vehicles in Mexico.",
        "And the United Auto Workers Union said no, you need to be building small cars in the United States.",
        "And indeed, General Motors has said that they will pick one of its factories to build a small car, one in either Wisconsin, Michigan or Tennessee."

        "And as you look at this, the shareholders now, including the U.S.",
        "Treasury, but they include Canada and the province of Ontario, as well, are they going to be putting their autoworkers first at the top of that list of uninsured creditors?",
        "You know, it brings up a whole lot of questions here, because between the United States and Canada and Ontario, 72-and-a-half percent of General Motors will be owned by governments.",
        "And when governments own something, they tend to want to get priority for their considerations.",
        "And so for Canada, that will be jobs in Canada.",
        "For the United States, that will be jobs in United States.",

        "Why?",
        "Because the German car offered better quality, better handling, more fun to drive and safer, better fuel economy and retained greater resale value.",
        "Until that turns around, someone else can buy their cars.",
        "It was a point addressed at a news conference today by GM President Fritz Henderson in New York.",
        "Give us another chance.",

        "Hi, thanks for taking my call.",
        "I'd like to say the sacrifice we're making, I don't feel it's necessary because we do have private-sector companies - Ford, Toyota, Honda - that are making those sacrifices already in the private sector, doing what they have to do to survive.",
        "And yet we're just talking about bailing out this one company.",
        "It's not the private sector, it's one single company that might vanish if we let them fail.",
        "To be fair, probably two if you count Chrysler, but Mickey Maynard, he's got a point.",
        "Well, I would probably make the same point, that consumers have a choice and the ultimate test of this bankruptcy will be whether both General Motors and Chrysler can get people to buy their cars again.",
        "You know, General Motors said something today that I hadn't heard before.",
        "They said they have 400,000 contracts out there.",
        "So in other words, it's not just parts suppliers.",
        "It's stationery makers.",
        "It's people that deliver bottled water to the General Motors building, and on and on and on and on.",
        "So it really does touch a lot of people.",
        "On the other hand, nobody buys a car because they know the person who prints the annual report for General Motors.",
        "They buy a car because it meets their family's needs.",
        "In other words, Ford has those same contracts, and they're going to have to compete against almost a public entity these days.",
        "And that's a big concern.",
        "And I think people at Ford have been looking at this and looking at this because they actually did get the savings from the United Auto Workers, and they got them first, before General Motors and Chrysler.",
        "So on the union side, they are going to save some money.",
        "On the other hand, that's not the only part of building a car.",
        "In fact, labor's really a tiny portion of it, and Ford will have to work very hard to make sure that it can stay competitive in the face of the savings that these other two companies are getting.",

        "I hear a lot of talk on all the news media that I, as a taxpayer, I am now literally a bondholder, a shareholder and owner of GM.",
        "And so what I would like to know before I can make an informed decision on whether it's been worth it is at some point in my life and my wife's life as taxpayers, do we have - actually have shares of GM that at some point, when GM hopefully turns itself around, we could hold onto, sell, trade or collect dividends from?",
        "Or is it just politic speak?",
        "Well, those shares are being held for you by the Treasury Department.",
        "And the way it was described today was that even when General Motors comes out of bankruptcy, its stock won't return to the stock exchange just yet.",
        "It would probably be sometime next year before the company is strong enough to issue stock again.",
        "And once that happens, then they'll start paying back the Treasury.",
        "So there'll never be Americans actually getting a piece of paper that say I'm one of the 300-million owners of General Motors.",
        "Okay.",
        "So basically, the money that's come out of the U.S.",
        "Treasury from taxpayer funds is just kind of thank you for the money.",
        "We know this is good and general, but you're not really a shareholder, per se.",
        "Well, the U.S.",
        "government, but not you individually.",
        "No, I'm afraid not.",
        "Pardon?",
        "I'm afraid not, no. It's the Treasury that - the Treasury on behalf of the American people that has the ownership of General Motors.",
        "Correct.",

        "It was $.75.",
        "Back in 2000, it was about $70 a share, and this was a stock that people bought as a long-term investment.",
        "You know, they used to say that widows and orphans owned General Motors stock, but so did a lot of pension plans and other retirement funds, and it was seen as such a safe investment.",
        "Now the recovery plan, the restructuring plan, assumes that when General Motors comes out of bankruptcy that its stock will sell for something like 10 to $12 a share.",
        "Well, Ford's stock is I believe below $6 a share.",
        "So that's kind of a bet on the future there, that GM would be worth that much.",
        "And indeed that the economy will recover, and people are going to be interested in buying new cars.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "And this idea that I think they're talking about, well, we could break even if there are 10 million cars a year sold, we might be able to make a profit, what, about 12 or 13?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "And, you know, the market right now, it's about 9.3 million at the - they call it the selling rate.",
        "So if you take where sales are now and transpose them onto a whole year, then the selling rate is about 9.3 million vehicles, and it's the worst in over a quarter century.",
        "So what GM is saying is that even things just pick up a little tiny bit, that they'd break even, and then if they get to slightly better, say 20 percent better, that they would be making money again.",
        "And you know, they weren't making money at 17 million sales.",
        "So that was with all of the debt, all the structure before the contracts had been rewritten.",
        "So what they're saying is we'll get rid of all that detritus, and we'll be a slimmer company, and we'll come out without much debt, and then we'll be making money.",
