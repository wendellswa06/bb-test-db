        "What we did with Blue Gene was something absolutely counterintuitive at the time we began the project.",
        "Most supercomputers string together a bunch of off-the-shelf processors, the kinds that power a high-end desktop.",
        "The problem is that these fast processors use a lot of power, generate a lot of heat and are hard to string together in an efficient way.",
        "So Turek says Blue Gene relies on processors that are relatively weak."
