        "A dirty bomb would be radiological material wrapped in a conventional explosion.",
        "And it would be dispersed in an area, and it depends on the kind of material.",
        "But if it was, for instance, cesium 137, it would possibly deny access to an area for some time.",
        "So it's not the immediate explosion that causes the most devastating blow, but it's the economic repercussions.",
        "If it was set off downtown financial area anywhere in the world and you couldn't use that area for sometimes years to come because certain types of radiological material penetrate both wood and concrete, it would be extremely difficult to remove.",
