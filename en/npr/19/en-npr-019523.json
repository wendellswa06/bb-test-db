        "Any impact would be felt largely at the regional or commuter airlines because that's where pilots often begin their commercial career.",
        "Cohen can't say when the regional airlines might face an acute shortage of pilots, but warns when they do, flights will be cancelled and service to some communities will be cut, though others say Cohen is overstating his case.",
        "Still, there's no question the industry is facing some headwinds with respect to pilots.",
        "The retirements start tomorrow.",
        "Kit Darby, an aviation industry consultant, says thousands of pilots are closing in on the mandatory retirement age of 65.",

        "Its quite a bit better than it used to be and it's competitive.",
        "It's a good base pay.",

        "And then there's all kinds of bonuses that could raise that well up over a hundred.",

        "The number of people getting private pilot licenses has fallen sharply.",

        "The question of whether or not to fund embryonic stem cell research highlights just how sensitive private charities can be about controversial biomedical issues.",

        "It said the group had also defunded human embryonic stem cell research.",
