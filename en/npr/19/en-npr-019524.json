        "But according to architect David Burney, former New York City commissioner of Design and Construction, it's time to celebrate the steps.",
        "There was a time before the elevator when the staircase was a huge opportunity for architects.",
        "You know, three-dimensional space, the sort of sculptural quality of the stair.",
        "So we'd like to bring the staircase back.",
        "Why the enthusiasm for the stairs?",
        "The answer is more medical than architectural.",
        "It's a public health campaign.",

        "An estimated...",
        "If the average American adult was to climb just two minutes more of stairs per day, we could burn enough calories to offset the average annual weight gains that we see in American adults.",
