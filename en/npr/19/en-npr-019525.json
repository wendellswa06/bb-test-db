        "Employees obtained large amounts of cash from Siemens cash desks.",

        "Well, I think it's better than appropriate.",
        "I think they got a good deal.",
        "Not only because of the dollar amount that they paid, but also because the company technically did not admit to bribery.",

        "So they really like what Bernie talks about, and they feel that he's maybe more or less beholden to special interests than Hillary might be.",
        "But on the flip side, the Clinton voters or people who have shown up at Clinton events have said that they feel more confident that Clinton could execute that plan and actually get something done on some of those policies."

        "We've always said that there's three tickets out of Iowa, and maybe this year, it's four or five, but I don't think it does necessarily diminish the value there.",
        "But as you say, people in Iowa talk about there being three tickets out of Iowa, meaning that the field gets winnowed down there.",
