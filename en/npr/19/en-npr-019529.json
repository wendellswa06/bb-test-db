        "And I wonder if there's an argument to be made that maybe this process should be taken out of the hands of Congress.",
        "In other words, similar to the plan to close down military bases in the 1990s, perhaps there should be an outside committee that simply reforms the tax code that is not necessarily beholden or influenced by outside interests.",

        "I think the real issue in the top rate is that nobody pays it.",

        "I don't think that's the real heart of the problem.",
        "The heart of the problem is that we have a preferential 15 percent capital gains rate.",

        "And that is totally wrong.",
        "It's unfair, and yet it's the heart of the tax system problem we have today.",
        "Now why do we have 15 percent capital gains rate?",
        "Well, it's an obsolete provision that originated in the 1970s when we had double-digit inflation.",
        "And I supported it then as a member of Congress, because with double-digit inflation, you were taxing phantom gains, you know, on capital gains.",
        "So a lot of the gain wasn't real.",
        "It was simply 10 percent inflation.",
        "But that's all gone.",
        "We don't have any serious inflation anymore.",
        "And so the whole rationale for a lower, dramatically lower capital gains rate has disappeared.",
        "And now it's just a huge windfall subsidy to the rich.",
        "Essentially, most of the people who are earning capital gains and socking it away are wealthier, not necessarily wage earners.",
        "If you reform that and you taxed it at, say, 35 percent, how much do you think it could actually generate for the government?",
        "It would all depend year to year on the rate at which capital gains would be realized.",
        "So it wouldn't be as predictable as income tax revenue, which other than, you know, marginal changes in employment wouldn't change that much year to year.",
        "On the other hand, I will say that it would be multiple tens of billions of dollars because there is a huge amount of capital gains in the economy.",
        "And the more important point is that it would eliminate the incentive to game the system, to try to turn ordinary, you know, earned income that every other American generates and has to pay tax on into capital gains.",
        "So I think if you ask the tax technicians, you know, they might tell you that you would get 50 or 100 billion a year.",
        "But over time, after removing the incentives and putting the tax lawyers toward doing something more useful, I think it would generate even more revenue as income became more evenly and uniformly taxed.",
        "That's David Stockman.",
