        "Would the leaders of North Korea and Iran be so insane as to launch one or two missiles against the United States with the certainty that in the face of overwhelming American retaliation they would be committing national suicide?",

        "Garwin has been a key adviser to many administrations over the years on issues involving nuclear weapons.",
        "Garwin testified before a congressional panel earlier this year that the threat of attack with nuclear weapons is real, but not delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles.",
        "A state wishing to deliver nuclear weapons to injure the United States homeland would far more likely use short-range ballistic missiles or cruise missiles launched from a ship to attack US coastal cities with nuclear weapons than use an ICBM for that purpose.",
        "The Bush administration has been working hard to develop sea-based missile defenses.",
        "The latest successful anti-missile flight test at sea involved the USS Lake Erie off Hawaii several months ago."
