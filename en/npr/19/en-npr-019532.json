        "Did they go and say, this man, Julian Assange, raped me?",
        "No.",
        "As understand it, they just sort of told their stories to police and didn't want him to be prosecuted.",
        "However, the prosecutor on duty on a Friday night is a kind of weekend prosecutor, decided that the facts were too condemnatory to ignore.",
        "So the prosecutor on duty on Friday night issued a warrant for his arrest on rape and molestation charges.",
        "The next morning, a second prosecutor, higher ranking prosecutor took a look at the police reports and said, no, I'm not sure that there's a case here, particularly on the rape charge.",
        "So they withdrew the warrant for his arrest, dropped the rape charge.",
        "It looked like the whole case was just going to disappear, but then the two women hired a very experienced lawyer in Stockholm who said, I don't think these charges should be dropped, I'm going to take this to an even higher prosecutor.",
        "So he took it to one of the highest prosecutors in the land in Sweden.",
        "And she not only sustained the molestation charge, but reopened a rape case and that's the case on which the Swedish authorities obtained this warrant for his extradition.",
        "Mark, do you know how rape laws in Sweden compare, say, with rape laws on the books here in the United States?",
        "As I understand it, there are three different grades of crime labeled as rape.",
        "The crime that he was charged with, this was the lowest grade of rape.",
        "In other words, third degree rape, I guess we would call it in the United States, which would carry a prison sentence if convicted of up to four years or, you know, less than that if it was a lesser conviction.",
        "From what I gather, and what was read out in court today during the extradition hearing in London, there was no mention of the word rape, there were just various issues of sexual coercion and molestation.",
        "So, again, it's not entirely clear to me what the current state of play is legally.",
        "But, clearly, you know, not only did the Swedish get a warrant for his arrest, but the British authorities extricated that warrant and decided to deny him in bail, so he's now in custody and has to await a hearing by British authorities as to whether he should be returned to Sweden.",
        "I have seen this quote from one of the women who told a Swedish newspaper that Julian Assange is a man who has a twisted attitude to women and a problem with taking no for an answer.",
        "I've seen those very same quotes."
