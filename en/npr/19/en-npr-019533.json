        "The Pentagon intends to boost that number to nearly 5,000, making the Cyber Command a major war-fighting force.",
        "Joining us now to talk more about it is NPR's Tom Gjelten.",
        "And, Tom, to start, why the big increase and why now?",
        "Well, Audie, it's really the culmination of a couple of ideas.",
        "One, this notion that the country is really vulnerable to cyberattack.",
        "Second, that wars, from here on, are likely to involve a lot of cyber combat.",
        "One Pentagon official told me today that this plan responds to the reality that the country could soon face a cyberattack as destructive as the terrorist attack on 9/11.",
        "In other words, one that would paralyze the nation.",
        "We're seeing more of these attacks every day, against both civilian and military networks.",
        "And then, the second thing, is this recognition that the military needs to be able to carry out offensive operations in cyber.",
        "It needs to add cyberattacks to part of its general war fighting capabilities.",
        "You would need a lot more cyber warriors if you were going to be serious about that.",
        "So what exactly would these 4,000 additional cyber warriors be doing?"

        "And if it's not, go away.",
        "And I think people felt like we got there, at the end of the day, to something that's going to create the kind of competition and accountability.",
        "But you also just had a lot of fear under the status quo, that people were one pink slip away from losing their insurance for themselves and their families.",
