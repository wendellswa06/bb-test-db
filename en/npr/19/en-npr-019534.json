        "man named Santae Tribble of murder.",
        "Today, two women on that jury believe they were mistaken.",
        "A judge threw out the conviction earlier this year and Tribble is asking to be declared legally innocent.",
        "NPR's Carrie Johnson has the story of his case and of the jurors now haunted by their decision to convict.",
        "In January 1981, a jury took only a few hours to convict Santae Tribble of shooting a cabbie dead in a botched robbery.",
        "The key evidence was a woman's stocking the murderer wore over his face.",
        "That stocking contained hair the FBI said it had matched to Tribble.",
        "Susan Dankoff, a fundraising executive in Washington, was a juror in the case.",
        "They admitted that they didn't know with certainty but the numbers they threw out were so steep as to make it virtually certain that it was his hair.",
        "In fact, prosecutors told the jury in the closing argument there was only a one in 10 million chance it could be someone else's hair.",
        "But Santae Tribble, his family members, and his girlfriend all testified that he was home, sleeping at the time of the murder.",
        "Dankoff remembers she considered the alibi and rejected it.",
        "Then you start to think, OK, maybe they're covering for him.",
        "And I think that that was really what it came down to.",
        "So the jury voted to convict.",
        "But the hair analysis that proved so persuasive to the jurors has been completely discredited.",
        "Even the Justice Department says Santae Tribble didn't do it.",
        "Dankoff says she got a call from Tribble's lawyer not too long ago letting her know."

        "Oken says these findings clearly supported babies getting more DHA.",
        "But the research did not find that the benefits lasted as the infants became toddlers.",
        "So it could be that the benefits of extra DHA are short-lived, or it could be that what a mom eats when she is pregnant may be more important than what the child eats once he or she is born.",
        "Oken says not knowing for sure is just part of the scientific process.",
        "You know, in science there has to be sort of a preponderance of evidence and that doesn't come from just one study.",
        "Figuring out whether extra DHA helps you think better may take time, but for pregnant women and developing babies it's absolutely crucial, because the brain is literally made out of DHA."

        "If people are buying these fish oil supplements, which they think are good for them, do they have to worry about mercury?",
        "Actually, no. There is no concern about mercury in these supplements and that's because there's a sort of standard refining and distillation process.",
