        "Now, there's also the issue of how the body absorbs the supplements versus sort of eating fish.",
        "And the researchers I spoke with tell me that from the limited studies that have been done, they say it's the same molecule - the DHA is the same molecule, whether it's in fish or if it's in a supplement, so that the body would take it up the same way.",
