        "The exciting thing about this field is that people are really looking now finally at, you know, what is the effect of fish consumption?",
        "Oken and her colleagues are among the first to closely track the risks and the benefits of fish eating in a group of Americans.",
        "Eight years ago, they recruited hundreds of pregnant women who shared details of their diets and gave blood samples so scientists could see exactly how much mercury was in their blood.",
        "When the children of these women turned three, researchers evaluated them using something called the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test that correlates with verbal IQ.",
        "It turns out that fish intake was associated with a two-point higher score.",
        "But children whose mothers had the highest blood mercury levels scored about four points lower on the test.",
        "So while the differences are measurable, Oken says there are not huge swings.",
        "The kinds of exposures that people are getting from eating fish are not likely to take a child who would have been a genius and make them below average.",
        "These are very subtle effects for any individual child.",
        "But Oken says if you look at the whole population, these subtle changes could influence the number of children on the threshold of being mentally retarded; or on the other side of the spectrum, the number of children within reach of being considered academically gifted.",
        "Oken's study is ongoing and she'll continue evaluating the children through the school years to better understand how these associations between fish consumption and mental development hold up.",
        "We've been listening to NPR's Allison Aubrey.",
        "And Allison, I want to ask one more question that you allude to in a piece, but just asking it directly.",
        "If people are buying these fish oil supplements, which they think are good for them, do they have to worry about mercury?",
        "Actually, no. There is no concern about mercury in these supplements and that's because there's a sort of standard refining and distillation process.",
        "So when manufactured by the oil, it's in a triglyceride form and they convert it to this form called ethyl ester.",
        "They distill it.",
        "And when they distill it, they leave behind the mercury and the other contaminants."

        "Some groups have tested these - Consumer Reports, consumerlab.com - and they've analyzed many brands and have found there are no problems.",
        "So the stuff is safe.",
        "The stuff is an essential building block for your brain, although it has varying benefits at varying times.",
        "I guess the next question is - are all different kinds of this fish oil or other kinds of supplements the same?",
        "So supplements that are labeled as fish oil, they'll have a combination of DHA, which we've just heard a lot about, and EPA.",
        "These are the two long-chained polyunsaturated fatty acids.",
        "And the DHA is considered the beneficial one.",
        "The same is true of cod liver oil, has the DHA and EPA.",
        "Now, if you're buying something that says omega 3 on the label...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "We get far more attention from all corners of the music world now.",
        "...that means it will probably have a third type of polyunsaturated fatty acid.",
        "This is called ALA, or alpha-linoleic acid.",
        "And this is the fatty acid that comes in nuts and seeds and in the membranes of a lot of dark leafy plants.",
        "Now, there's also the issue of how the body absorbs the supplements versus sort of eating fish.",
        "And the researchers I spoke with tell me that from the limited studies that have been done, they say it's the same molecule - the DHA is the same molecule, whether it's in fish or if it's in a supplement, so that the body would take it up the same way.",
        "You mentioned that all of this is coming from algae, it's coming through fish and getting to people.",
        "What if you go to the source?",
        "Can you go to the source and just eat algae, if that sounds tasty?",
        "Well, I guess you could if you found the right pond scum and you knew it had DHA in it."

        "But Martek, where we visited earlier, they actually make their own algae supplements that are sold just as supplements, and they also sell it to lots of manufacturers who are now adding it to orange juice, eggs, buttery spreads, you name it.",
        "There's a lot of DHA supplement in foods now.",
        "And the reason, again, is that not everybody has latched onto this idea that it's good for brain health, but there is a very strong body of evidence linking them to heart health.",
