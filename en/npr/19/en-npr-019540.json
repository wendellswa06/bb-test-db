        "It seems a clerk accidentally changed a number on one of the Medicare provisions of the bill after the measure left the Senate, but before it returned to the House for a final vote.",
        "The mistake, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, was fixed before the bill went to the White House, but it appears that the bills that passed the House and Senate were not the same, and that's a problem.",
