        "The Senate's actually debating three separate bills.",
        "All will be voted on tomorrow.",
        "But the main event is a bill passed by the House 14 months ago to lift limits imposed by President Bush on federal funding of research using stem-cells from human embryos.",
        "The president, in August of 2001, said federal funding could proceed but only on stem-cell lines already in existence.",
        "Those lines have turned out to be less helpful than scientists had hoped, so backers of the bill, like Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter, say it's time to ease research funding limits, particularly for the estimated 400,000 embryos currently left over in fertility clinic freezers.",
        "If they could be used to create human life, I would not in the remotest way contend that they ought to be used for scientific research.",
        "But the fact is that they will either be used for scientific research or thrown away.",
        "Opponents of the bill, however, say research that requires destroying a human embryo is a moral line that ought not be crossed using taxpayer dollars.",
        "Kansas Republican Sam Brownback appeared this afternoon at a news conference with children who were adopted as frozen embryos.",
        "We do not need to treat humans as raw material.",

        "Real hope for people with Parkinson's.",
        "Real hope for people with spinal cord injuries.",

        "could experience what amounts to a biomedical brain drain.",
        "We not only risk the futures of Americans living with currently incurable diseases, we also risk our national reputation as the home of the world's most innovative and distinguished scientists working to improve health.",
        "Opponents of the measure, however, say that the bill isn't needed; that stem-cells from adults and umbilical cord blood are just as promising as those from embryos.",
        "Tom Coburn is a Republican from Oklahoma.",
        "The choice is not destroy embryos and if we don't we won't get good research.",
        "The choice is go where the money's leading us and the money's leading us into adult stem-cells, germ cell lines and other lines that have none of the problems of embryonic stem-cells."

        "Indeed, one of the other bills the Senate will take up would encourage the National Institutes of Health to fund research on ways to find scientifically promising stem-cells without destroying embryos.",

        "The alternative bill might not do any harm, but it doesn't do any good either.",
