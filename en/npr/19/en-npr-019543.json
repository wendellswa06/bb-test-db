        "Tom, why was this group commissioned and who's on it?",
        "And if we could, let's take the why before the who.",
        "It was created at the behest of some members of Congress, most notably Representative Frank Wolf of Northern Virginia, last spring, and at the time it was seen as kind of a sop to Republicans in Congress, which is the White House saying sure, sure, sure.",
        "We know you're upset about Iraq.",
        "Go have your little study group.",
        "What you had over the last month though was this huge shift in American politics that suddenly has made this group much more important.",
        "And who's working on the ISG?",
        "You have essentially a bunch of old Washington hands.",
        "There are 10 members.",
        "It's five Republicans, five Democrats, led by former secretary of state, former White House chief of staff James Baker and former Indiana Democratic Representative Lee Hamilton, who was chairman of the House International Relations Committee.",
        "The other members are Leon Panetta, also a former White House chief of staff, Lawrence Eagleburger, who was secretary of state for a bit, Vernon Jordan, longtime Washington power broker, Edwin Meese, who was a White House counselor and then later attorney general, former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, former Defense Secretary William Perry and two former senators, Democrat Chuck Robb of Virginia and Republican Alan Simpson of Wyoming.",
        "Is it sort of like the 9/11 Commission?",
        "That's a good analogy.",
        "I think even a closer one is the Social Security Commission done in the early 1980s.",
        "When something became so politically difficult that there was just no way that the White House and Congress could deal with it, you have a bipartisan commission devise an answer and sell it to both those entities, maybe in such a fuzzy way that both have cover or at least both can get out of the very sterile debate that they've locked themselves into.",
        "So what exactly have they studied?",
        "They really have immersed themselves in it.",
        "They've gone out to Iraq and talked to members of the Iraqi government.",
        "They've talked to dozens of area specialists, military specialists, even some journalists, you know, running the ideological gamut.",
        "I think that's, in effect, what we're hired to do.",
        "And if we don't do a good job, we ought to all be fired.",
        "But I also think the only way, in a practical sense, you do it is if you put a package together that has a bit of shared sacrifice and everybody has to get in the game."

        "At some point, there is that appeal to patriotism over party that the American people, and candidly, I hope and pray, at least the American business will respond to as well.",
        "See, I think this issue is every bit as serious as the threat of fascism, the threat of communism, the threat of terrorism.",
        "It really is a question about what America and who America is going to be in the 21st century.",

        "Now back in 1986, the government did reform the tax code.",
        "It was simplified.",
        "Eugene Steuerle helped write it, and he worked in the Treasury Department at the time.",
        "And he says ever since then, members of Congress have essentially undone most of that reform.",
        "So every new elected official thinks that he has to - or she has to tinker with the tax code as well.",
        "And so provisions get added on to provisions and we get more and more complexity.",
        "And so like barnacles on an old boat, the code grew and grew as members of Congress added their pet tax credits and loopholes to the code.",
        "So can it be simplified once again?",
        "That's a question I put to Republican Congressman Charles Boustany of Louisiana.",
        "Clearly, we've seen an explosion in a number of deductions and credits.",
        "And I think what we need to do is have an honest look at all of these and develop some metrics on how you evaluate these credits.",
        "Meaning, who benefits, what is the economic impact, do these help create jobs, or do they have a very narrow application.",
        "This coming week, the House and Senate Ways and Means Committees will hold a joint - a historic joint meeting.",
        "The first time, I guess, since 1940 to discuss tax reform.",
        "Let's say the ball starts rolling now and all the members are serious about doing this.",
        "How long do you think it'll take to actually accomplish?",
        "Well, it's difficult to say.",
        "But we know the 1986 tax reform process took a concerted effort of three years and there was work done even prior to that.",
        "So we expect this to be a drawn-out process if we're going to get it right.",
        "You have to have many, many hearings to investigate all of these aspects of the tax code."

        "They look at Washington and they see that not a whole lot's getting done.",
        "And I wonder if there's an argument to be made that maybe this process should be taken out of the hands of Congress.",
        "In other words, similar to the plan to close down military bases in the 1990s, perhaps there should be an outside committee that simply reforms the tax code that is not necessarily beholden or influenced by outside interests.",
        "I disagree with that.",
        "And I think, clearly, the Constitution spells out the authority for Congress with regard to the generation of revenues and taxation.",

        "I think the real issue in the top rate is that nobody pays it.",
        "In other words, that's the statutory rate.",

        "I think we ought to let the Bush tax cuts expire, so the top rate would be 39 percent.",
        "I don't think that's the real heart of the problem.",
        "The heart of the problem is that we have a preferential 15 percent capital gains rate.",
        "And that means that millionaires and billionaires are paying a lower rate on most of their income, which is capital gains and not earned, than the gardeners and the housekeepers who work for them.",
        "And that is totally wrong.",
        "It's unfair, and yet it's the heart of the tax system problem we have today.",

        "Well, it's an obsolete provision that originated in the 1970s when we had double-digit inflation.",
        "And I supported it then as a member of Congress, because with double-digit inflation, you were taxing phantom gains, you know, on capital gains.",
        "So a lot of the gain wasn't real.",

        "Essentially, most of the people who are earning capital gains and socking it away are wealthier, not necessarily wage earners.",
        "If you reform that and you taxed it at, say, 35 percent, how much do you think it could actually generate for the government?",
        "It would all depend year to year on the rate at which capital gains would be realized.",
        "So it wouldn't be as predictable as income tax revenue, which other than, you know, marginal changes in employment wouldn't change that much year to year.",

        "And the more important point is that it would eliminate the incentive to game the system, to try to turn ordinary, you know, earned income that every other American generates and has to pay tax on into capital gains.",
        "So I think if you ask the tax technicians, you know, they might tell you that you would get 50 or 100 billion a year.",
        "But over time, after removing the incentives and putting the tax lawyers toward doing something more useful, I think it would generate even more revenue as income became more evenly and uniformly taxed.",

        "And she not only sustained the molestation charge, but reopened a rape case and that's the case on which the Swedish authorities obtained this warrant for his extradition.",
        "Mark, do you know how rape laws in Sweden compare, say, with rape laws on the books here in the United States?",
        "As I understand it, there are three different grades of crime labeled as rape.",
        "The crime that he was charged with, this was the lowest grade of rape.",
