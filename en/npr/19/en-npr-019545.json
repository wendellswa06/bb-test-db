        "Bush took office, he brought with him advisers that were convinced a scaled-down version of missile defense must be deployed to confront the threat, not from Russia's huge arsenal of ICBMs, but from the isolated rogue states of the world which were developing missiles and which, the reasoning went, could not be deterred from using them against the US.",
        "Lieutenant General Henry Obering is the director of the Missile Defense Agency.",

        "Thirty-six-year-old Casey Lippmeier is a New Englander who grew up eating lots of fish.",
        "These days he still loves a good Maine lobster, but now as senior scientist at the Martek Corporation he gets most of his omega-3s from a source that's grown right in his company's laboratory, which is kept under lock and key.",

        "Inside there are hundreds of samples of green algae jiggling around in small glass shake flasks.",
        "What makes them valuable to Martek is the fact that many of these algae strains have abundant supplies of a particular form of omega-3 fatty acid called DHA, which is exactly what's found in fish oil.",
        "Lippmeier explains that fish do not make DHA; they get it through the food chain.",
        "So the algae are very, very small, and so of the large fish can't eat algae directly.",
        "So you know, the algae are eaten by other really small things - cocopods, rotifers, things like that, and then, you know, those will get eaten by slightly larger fish, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, until you get up to the biggest fish all.",
        "In the wild, big fish that provide lots of DHA can also build up contaminants such as mercury or PCDs in their tissue.",
        "So as Lippmeier sees it, Martek is producing a pure supply of DHA by fermenting algae in big, steel brewer tanks.",
        "These tanks, we know all the ingredients that go into it and so we can assure about what all the ingredients that are coming out of it.",
        "When Martek's biologist first came up with the idea of growing algae to produce DHA supplements, no one seemed to notice.",
        "But in 2002, manufacturers of infant milk formula began adding Martek's DHA to the formula.",
        "The decision was based on clinical trials that found infants who were fed a DHA supplement did better on cognitive tests than babies who were fed a regular formula.",
        "Emily Oken is a researcher at Harvard Medical School.",
        "She says the most significant effect of the DHA seemed to be improved visual processing.",
        "So looking at whether infants can recognize a new face compared to one they've seen before, and they seem to do that quickly.",
        "Oken says these findings clearly supported babies getting more DHA.",
        "But the research did not find that the benefits lasted as the infants became toddlers."
