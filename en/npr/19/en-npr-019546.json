        "Oken says not knowing for sure is just part of the scientific process.",
        "You know, in science there has to be sort of a preponderance of evidence and that doesn't come from just one study.",
        "Figuring out whether extra DHA helps you think better may take time, but for pregnant women and developing babies it's absolutely crucial, because the brain is literally made out of DHA.",
        "Norman Salem is a neurobiologist with the National Institutes of Health.",
        "He explains that DHA makes brain membranes flexible, which is important.",
        "Animal studies show that when DHA is drastically reduced in the brain, processing slows.",

        "Nuts and seeds such as walnuts, flax seed and canola oil are good supplies, though the body has to convert these plant sources to DHA.",
        "And since fish are loaded with lots of DHA and protein, Harvard's Emily Oken has made fish the focus of her work.",
        "The exciting thing about this field is that people are really looking now finally at, you know, what is the effect of fish consumption?",
        "Oken and her colleagues are among the first to closely track the risks and the benefits of fish eating in a group of Americans.",
        "Eight years ago, they recruited hundreds of pregnant women who shared details of their diets and gave blood samples so scientists could see exactly how much mercury was in their blood.",

        "Okay.",
        "But it was, I think, skewed a little bit towards the American scene.",
