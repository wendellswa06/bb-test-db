        "The president, in August of 2001, said federal funding could proceed but only on stem-cell lines already in existence.",
        "Those lines have turned out to be less helpful than scientists had hoped, so backers of the bill, like Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter, say it's time to ease research funding limits, particularly for the estimated 400,000 embryos currently left over in fertility clinic freezers.",
        "If they could be used to create human life, I would not in the remotest way contend that they ought to be used for scientific research.",
        "But the fact is that they will either be used for scientific research or thrown away.",
        "Opponents of the bill, however, say research that requires destroying a human embryo is a moral line that ought not be crossed using taxpayer dollars.",
        "Kansas Republican Sam Brownback appeared this afternoon at a news conference with children who were adopted as frozen embryos.",

        "Both cases were a bit unusual because the women planned to use donor eggs, and instead of carrying the children themselves, both were going to have those eggs implanted into another women's womb, a woman who would serve as a so-called gestational carrier.",
        "In a strange twist, the ethics committee at the hospital had to decide whether to impose a cutoff for childbirth even if the woman in question had no biological involvement in the pregnancy.",
