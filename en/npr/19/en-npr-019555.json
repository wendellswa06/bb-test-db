        "You are definitely right on that, and you're seeing the result of that, a lot of angry little teams.",
        "I mean look at what's happened just in the first four days of the tournament.",
        "As you mentioned, George Mason of the Colonial Athletic Association shocked North Carolina, that's the NCAA defending champion North Carolina Tar Heels, and then earlier, George Mason beat Michigan State of the Big 10 in the first round, and Michigan State made it to the Final Four last year.",
        "Also in the first four days of the tournament, University of Wisconsin Milwaukee beat Oklahoma, a Big 12 team.",
        "Northwestern State beat Iowa, a Big 10 team, and then as you mentioned, Wichita State of the Missouri Valley Conference beat Seaton Hall in Tennessee, Bradley beat Kansas, and today Pittsburgh of the Big East.",
        "I mean it's mayhem.",
        "It's March Madness.",
        "Very well put.",
        "I mean, in a very telling moment, after George Mason beat Michigan State in the first round, the George Mason coach was just crowing about other teams from his conference having beaten teams from the major conferences during the regular season, not just in this tournament.",
        "And a reporter who heard this said, you know, it sounded like he was on a crusade, and it really is that way, I think, with the coaches and the players from these mid-major teams.",
        "So why all the upsets?",
        "Are the favorites having some tournament jitters, you think?",
        "Well, you know, I turned to today's game between Bradley and Pitt.",
        "At one point the announcer just said these guys are good and they're growing in confidence, and I think that speaks to a lot of these teams from the mid-majors and the lesser-known conferences.",
        "I wouldn't say it's jitters by the big guys.",
        "There's a lot of basketball talent out there that just hasn't been recognized because it's not happening in the conferences that get all the media attention.",
        "Can we expect to see a mid-major team going all the way or at least making it into the Final Four, you think?",
        "Well, never say never, but, you know, the odds are not that good.",
        "The teams in the major conferences are very good, like Duke and Connecticut, UCLA, Villanova.",
        "They're perennial powers, they've earned their reputations, and the odds are that they'll be there at the end."

        "The good news is they're saying for such a powerful earthquake, there's not many reports of injuries and, certainly, no reports of casualties.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "I think the most important lesson I learned that the court in and of itself, the way it is structured, is not the place for these problems to be, that the court system has a very few things at its disposal.",
        "They have jail time, they have probation, they have fines.",
        "Mental health issues are ongoing and systematic, and they deal on multiple levels - the ability of the person to live, to make money, have a place to go, to maintain medication and medical services - and the court has very little ability, especially on the criminal side, to deal effectively with people who have mental illness who happen as a result of that mental illness to break the law.",
        "Now, we all know about divorce courts and small claims courts, but there's also apparently mental health courts?",
        "Explain what that is and what those courts do.",
        "A mental health court is something new.",
        "They have sprung up like other what we call problem-solving courts have done to face systemic social problems that end up in the judicial system and have no other place to go.",
        "A mental health court is a place where if a defendant or someone who has committed usually a non-violent crime comes into court, usually has an ongoing problem with the justice system, and there is a system in place where he gets an opportunity to go into a mental health court.",
        "There, they deal with the problem."

        "Is this for relatively minor or non-violent offenses, or does this run the gamut?",
        "Typically it's for non-violent offenses, people who stay in trouble for trespassing or they're homeless or disorderly conduct or just out in the street and they sit down and cause a traffic jam; I mean, the things that you would see in a municipal court which is not a felony because - and these people re-offend on a continuous basis, and there is no system or anything to hold them up so they won't get into trouble.",
