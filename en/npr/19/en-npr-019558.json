        "And call it simply \"\"The Birds.",

        "And for most places, they've arbitrarily drawn their cutoff in particular places.",
        "Some places use an average age of the couple of a hundred.",
        "So if the husband was 20 and the woman was 80, I guess theoretically they would say yes.",
        "And obviously that situation seems odd, and you'd be concerned about what social issues underlay that relationship.",
        "But I think that's what you run into when you set arbitrary guidelines that aren't based on anything.",
        "So you've heard the arguments for and against this.",
        "What conclusion have you reached?",
        "At what age is a woman too old to become a mother?",
        "Well, I'm a liberal person, and I really felt that if women were well-counseled and healthy and we had no reason to think that she wouldn't be a good parent, that we shouldn't arbitrarily be deciding on a cutoff.",
        "I certainly was very comfortable with women using gestational carriers with donor eggs up to age 55.",
        "And I personally felt that we should have decided to do it on a case-by-case basis up to 60.",
        "That's Dr. Elizabeth Ginsburg of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.",
        "Her, as she calls it, liberal view about cutoff for motherhood are not shared by all.",
        "Dr. Robert Stillman, for one, says the dilemma over age cutoffs at Brigham and Women's is an easy call.",
        "He argues that there should be strict age limits for any kind of medically assisted conception.",
        "An important cutoff is when medical therapies can be successful.",
        "And once they cease to be successful, then medical advice would be that a woman should not conceive.",
        "Dr.",
        "Robert Stillman practices at the Shady Grove Fertility Center in Rockville, Maryland.",
        "The clinic doesn't offer in vitro fertilization to women older than 44 because that's the age most women stop producing their own eggs.",
        "And they don't allow women over the age of 51 to undergo IVF using donor eggs because 51 is the average age of onset for menopause.",
        "Most physicians are not interested in extending the reproductive life span, whether that be earlier than puberty--because we can induce ovulation in an eight year old, but no one would ever consider doing that hopefully--and menopausal women after their reproductive life has ended would not come under medical therapy either."

        "I want to make sure that I understand why you're not interested in extending a woman's reproductive years beyond menopause.",
        "Well, as medical practitioners, our goal is to treat patients.",
        "And if an individual at 22 or 32 or 42 has difficulty becoming pregnant, then it's our responsibility and honor to play a role in helping them do that.",
        "Somebody at 62 who wishes to conceive is not within the purview of medical intervention.",
        "So you're saying as a doctor, you treat medical disorders.",
        "And in your view, menopause is not a medical disorder.",
        "Precisely.",
        "And well-put.",
        "But you could also argue that a woman who is in her 40s, maybe even in her 50s, who's researched this, who understands the risk, who's gone through a process of full disclosure and still wants to move forward--you could argue that it would be unethical to deny her that treatment.",
        "Well, I think that's a specious argument.",
        "Again, as medical practitioners, not just technicians doing the bidding of an individual with a social goal, as legitimate as the social goal might be--I wouldn't judge a 62-year-old woman who wishes to get pregnant, judge whether that's good or bad.",
        "But a patient is an individual with a medically defined disorder, and infertility in menopause is not a medical disorder.",
        "So we should stick to what we do, and that's treat people.",
        "Dr.",
        "Stillman, should decisions be made on a case-by-case basis?",
        "Well, there are always exceptions.",
        "But a case-by-case basis, I think, brings up the concerns of a bias with one couple vs. another.",

        "Is their story sadder or less sad?",
        "Are they wealthy or less wealthy?",
        "Are they one race or another?",

        "A 55-year-old and another 55-year-old couple, how can I say yes to one and no to another?",
        "So if we do it based on biologic grounds and make it fair, then you say anybody over this biologic limit, we wouldn't treat.",
        "And anybody under the biologic limit, we would.",
        "That's Dr. Robert Stillman of Shady Grove Fertility Center in Rockville, Maryland.",
        "Childbirth near or beyond those biological limits does carry increased risk for both mother and child.",
        "Studies show that older women are more likely to develop high blood pressure and diabetes during pregnancy, and there's a higher incidence of birth defects and premature deliveries.",
        "Margaret Janicki LaBarbera was aware of those risks, but true love didn't arrive on a schedule in keeping with her biological clock.",
        "She didn't meet her husband until she was in her 50s.",
        "At age 54, she had their first child, made possible through in vitro fertilization and a donor's egg.",
        "She had a second child 16 months later.",
        "And now at 58, she's raising two toddlers."
