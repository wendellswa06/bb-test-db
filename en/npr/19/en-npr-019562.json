        "There, they deal with the problem.",
        "The judge is educated, the prosecutor, the probation department, and they have systems in place to allow this person to get the mental health assistance that they need instead of dealing it with so much as a criminal problem and keep the criminal thing over their head in order to allow them some kind of course of methods, but to deal with treatment and housing and all the other things that will allow this person not to re-offend."

        "And it's difficult, it is hard, but you have to have a sense of resolve about it and understand intrinsically you are doing the right thing for that person, not for your own convenience, not because you want it, but because that person will be better off if you do so.",
