        "Good morning to you.",
        "Tell us what you're seeing there.",
        "So, Renee, I'm actually at a mobile home park right now, and it's actually the same mobile home park that also was impacted by the first 6.4 earthquake a few days ago, only this time, many more of the mobile homes are significantly impacted.",
        "They're damaged.",
        "I'm standing in front of one right now that is literally off of its foundation.",
        "And the older woman who lives here - her son has come to help move her out.",
        "We do not see a building inspector.",
        "No building inspectors have actually come here.",
        "But the son and the woman clearly feel that it's too dangerous to live here at this point.",
        "They are moving out.",
        "And we've heard reports that thousands of people are now without power.",
        "What do you know about that?",
        "Well, I - what I know so far, Renee, is that power has been rolling in and out here.",
        "Now that it's morning time, it's a little bit more difficult to tell.",
        "I can tell you some of the traffic lights still remain a little bit not operational, and that's - they're beeping red.",
        "But in this case, I have here that it's just rolling.",
        "When we first got here last night, though, let me tell you the scene was eerie because half the town was basically in pitch black, including gas stations and car sales dealers that normally would have a lot of lights on - all black.",
        "So a very eerie scene, for sure.",
        "I do also want to just tell you a little bit more about the damage.",
        "And I'm standing also next to, like, a wall here that's made out of, like, concrete pillar blocks.",
        "Many of those pillar blocks have literally toppled over onto the ground almost like - it looks like a construction site almost, but, no, it was once a standing wall - no more.",
        "And, you know, we haven't heard of loss of life, but I'm wondering what you've heard about that sort of thing - injuries.",
        "You know, Renee, this is something that the people of Ridgecrest, people whom I've interviewed here since basically the first earthquake struck - they say, you know, there's 6.4 earthquake, a 7.1 earthquake.",
        "You know, that happens.",
        "But they are grateful that the worst that they've had so far is just damage.",
        "You are right.",
        "There are no reports at this time of any casualties or, really, even significant injuries."

        "They should know that the emergency room is open.",
        "At that point, if it's deemed serious enough, then somebody - some of the patients will be taken to other regional hospitals, perhaps in Palmdale about 70 to a hundred miles south of here, and to Lancaster, as well.",
        "But again, you're right.",
        "The good news is they're saying for such a powerful earthquake, there's not many reports of injuries and, certainly, no reports of casualties.",
        "Well, just briefly, people must be awfully nervous because, of course, there's aftershocks.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And let me just tell you, since I first got here, Renee, I have felt under my feet many, many aftershocks.",

        "Geological Survey confirms aftershocks are taking place here.",
        "I feel maybe...",
        "Right.",

        "This is pretty incredible criticism for a president to unleash on the Fed chairman.",
        "And I just want to get a sense from both of you, how worried do you think President Trump is about a recession?",
        "Hugo, let's start with you.",

        "And his tariffs are blamed by many economists for that effect, which is why people are talking about the possibility of tax cuts, which is why the stock market lurches downwards.",
        "You know, what - the economy is his strongest card in his efforts to win reelection in 2020.",
        "I mean, he's pegged his whole presidency on the health of the economy.",
        "He has; he's talked about the boom.",
        "He's taken credit for that.",
        "And obviously that means that, as all presidents are, he would take the blame if it goes down.",
        "And the stock market is a six-month leading indicator, which suggests that, early in next year, there's going to be lurches downwards because of exactly what's happening now.",
        "E.J.",
        "I think he's petrified because he's got very low approval ratings anyway, and imagine how low they could go if he didn't have a good economy.",
        "I mean, there was something crazy about the tweeting today.",
        "To compare one of your own appointees to China's dictator and call him an enemy would be shocking if we could be shocked by Trump anymore.",
        "In order to get the funding our communities need, to get the government the needed resources so that we know how big our communities are and where people are located, we need to participate."

        "And I think that they - the thing that they actually tell you is that the president doesn't know yet what he wants to do about those things.",
        "He talked about payroll taxes, and I don't think that that will be where a cut comes if there is.",
        "Larry Kudlow, his economic adviser, was talking, I think, earlier today or yesterday about the possibility of taking up a plan that Rick Scott - Senator Rick Scott of Florida - put forward, which was really kind of interesting.",
        "What he talked about was a middle-class tax cut which would be of the same size - that would compensate for the amount of extra money people are paying in prices because of tariffs.",
        "And the interesting thing about that is not just that it would be a stimulation for the economy, it's also - conceivably, it could make the tariffs less unpopular heading into the election year if they're compensated for by tax cuts.",
        "What do you think, E.J.? If you're a lawmaker on the Hill right now, like, trying to divine any sort of guidance from what the president has been saying this week, where would your brain be?"
