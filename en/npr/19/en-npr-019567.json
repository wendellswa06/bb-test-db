        "Twain starts the book in 1876.",
        "He finishes it in 1883.",
        "And this is a very, very depressing and grim and rather shocking period in American history, when almost all of the games that African-Americans made right after the Civil War are being overturned.",
        "So what you're finding is that this is a period when African-Americans in the South are, in effect, being re-enslaved, not unlike what happens to Jim who has been running for freedom during the book and then as re-incarcerated on the Phelps' farm.",
        "Twain is not writing a book that is attacking slavery.",
        "Slavery has been gone.",
        "But he's writing a book that engages the races and that persisted after slavery ended.",
        "And that still persists in American society.",
        "And this is one of the reasons why the book is so complicated and so interesting.",
        "Students across America do read \"\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\"\" but it's also been banned for - particularly for uses of the word nigger.",
        "Was that common speech at the time or a slur or both?",
        "It was both at the time.",
        "It was common speech in much of the South, particularly.",
        "And it was also a slur at the time that was increasingly recognized as such.",
        "If you read writing in - from the same period as Twain wrote, by others, you'll find the word nigger used throughout a lot of stories and novels, pieces written by black writers as well as white writers, also in poems.",
        "But, you know, it can be used in context that are just uncritically accepting the word as what was used or it can be used in context in which people are using that word in full knowledge of the slur that it embodied and using it to subvert to thinking behind that.",
        "Let's go back to the book.",
        "This time, Jim and Tom Sawyer.",
        "In this excerpt, Jim has been captured.",
        "He and Tom are discussing some unusual strategies to set Jim free.",
        "(As Tom Sawyer) You got any spiders in here, Jim?",
        "(As Jim) No, sir, thanks to goodness I hain't, Mars Tom.",
        "(As Tom Sawyer) Jim, don't act so foolish.",
        "A prisoner's got to have some kind of a dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried, why, there's more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life.",
        "(As Jim) Mars Tom, I's willin' to tackle mos' anything 'at ain't onreasonable, but if you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I's gwyne to leave, dat's shore.",
        "Now, Dr. Fishkin, to many of us now in the modern era, that sounds like pure shocking jibing.",
        "So what exactly is going on in this part of the book?"

        "What's tricky is that it probably sounds that way to readers during Twain's day.",
        "But we can also look at it through the perspective of history and realize that all of the crazy things that are inflicted on Jim in that last portion of the book resonate with all of the crazy things that are inflicted on African-Americans who want to vote after the Civil War, after the end of Reconstruction, up through the civil rights movement.",
        "So I mean there's a lot of lunacy in store in the next hundred years.",
        "And in a sense, this passage in the book, looks ahead to that, looks ahead to all of the absurd obstacles that are going to be thrown in the way of black freedom.",
        "Dr. Shelly Fisher Fishkin is director of American Studies and professor of English at Stanford University.",
        "She's published widely on Mark Twain.",
