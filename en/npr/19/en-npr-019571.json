        "What he's not aware of is how completely screwed up the society is, that is imposing all the time.",

        "The Civil War - we had more than 600,000 Americans who lost their lives in the battle between North and South.",
        "And slavery wasn't the only issue but it was the crux of how we see it today as well as one of the huge issues then.",
        "But Huck Finn was published 20 years after both the war and slavery ended.",
        "So set a scene for us, what was America like at the time that this book was published?",
        "Twain starts the book in 1876.",
        "He finishes it in 1883.",
        "And this is a very, very depressing and grim and rather shocking period in American history, when almost all of the games that African-Americans made right after the Civil War are being overturned.",
        "So what you're finding is that this is a period when African-Americans in the South are, in effect, being re-enslaved, not unlike what happens to Jim who has been running for freedom during the book and then as re-incarcerated on the Phelps' farm.",
        "And you have to remember the ships that bring in regular deliveries from the World Food Programme have to be escorted by NATO frigates to avoid being taken by Somali pirates.",

        "So that's what the humanitarian workers in the camps in Dadaab are having to deal with, and also across the border in Ethiopia.",
        "That is the reality.",

        "Is it getting into Somalia?",
        "Oh, it arrived in Mogadishu today, the Somali capital, because apart from the Somalis who were fleeing the drought-hit areas into neighboring countries, as we said into Kenya and Ethiopia, many thousands are also heading towards Mogadishu, the capital, in search of food, shelter and medical care.",

        "Well, it does, but if you don't mind, Neal, before we get there, I wanted to ask Ofeibea a quick question, and if I may parenthetically add how much I've admired her reporting from Africa.",
        "I have heard two different versions of what al-Shabaab has said, on the one hand that they have warned foreign aid agencies to stay out of there, that they don't want them in there, indeed that all this talk of famine is some kind of Western propaganda.",
        "And on the other hand, I've heard on the BBC from aid workers themselves in the area who say nonsense, we feel perfectly safe.",
        "What's the reality?",
        "Ted, I think it's a bit of both.",
        "I think what a lot of aid workers are saying is that al-Shabaab itself is a little divided.",
        "So local leaders in some area are cooperating because of course they don't want dead bodies, dead children, and starving people on their hands."

        "So you have the leadership of al-Shabaab saying, for example, the United Nations World Food Program, it was thrown out, it's not welcome, that it's promoting a Western agenda.",

        "That's what we have come for.",

        "So we'll have to see who allows that food aid in and who allows it to be distributed.",

        "and as we heard from Ofeibea Quist-Arcton just a moment ago, Ted, the United States government is very reluctant to let any - provide any aid that might go to al-Shabaab, but as we mentioned also, that might be due in part to lessons from 1991.",
        "Well, it's that old chestnut again, Neal: Those who ignore the lessons of history are condemned to repeat them.",
        "I find it hard to believe that it has been almost 20 years, but it has.",
        "President George H.W.",
        "Bush in that interim period between his defeat by Bill Clinton and the time that Clinton was inaugurated the following January, did something of great compassion at a time when indeed there was starvation in Somalia, as there is right now, and sent Marines over with enough food to feed - I think it was estimated that they had saved about 350,000 lives.",
        "I was there when the Marines landed in Mogadishu.",
        "It seemed like one of those wonderful humanitarian gestures that could not possibly go wrong.",
        "But in very short order, and indeed it was after Mr. Bush was no longer in office, in very short order some of the local warlords began doing what they inevitably do there, and that is stealing the food, selling it on a black market.",
