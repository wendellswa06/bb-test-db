        "A few weeks later, the killing began in nearby Rwanda, and the United States I think was so shell-shocked, as were the United Nations, by what had happened in Somalia that nothing was done.",
        "The end result was that 800,000 people were massacred in Rwanda.",
        "And that sort of comes back in a nutshell, Neal, to what you were talking about before: the lesson, the law, the rule of unintended consequences.",
        "Everybody wants to send food in.",
        "Everybody wants to help alleviate the starvation, but Somalia is an extremely dangerous place, and I'm not quite sure what the answer is.",
        "Well, let's see if we can get some help from some of our callers.",
        "John(ph) is on the line calling from Grand Rapids.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hi, John, any lessons that you can help us with here?",
        "Well, I was in Mogadishu in 1993, a part of - I worked with an NGO that was providing medical relief.",
        "And so our responsibility was to try to see if there was some specific input that we could provide: supplies, equipment, resources, medication, things of that sort.",
        "And on the ground there was one of the more devastating places I've ever been to.",
        "We always were in limited-access, third-world countries and such, but it was one of the only places that we ever attempted to serve where we found that we really could do very little because the infrastructure was so decimated that there was virtually no opportunity for us to provide meaningful resources that we could anticipate would be utilized by the people that needed them the most.",
        "You know, we visited feeding camps.",
        "We did mobile clinics.",
        "And other than the one-on-one things that we could do, the things that we had in our trunk, very, very little that we could do that would have lasting import.",
        "And could you imagine at this juncture sending significant amounts of aid to Southern Sudan - Southern Somalia, rather?",
        "I think it would be - given the fact that the political and governmental infrastructure is still relatively dysfunctional, it's hard for me to imagine that the things that we would provide without a direct hand in how they're distributed and how they're utilized, I think it would be almost fruitless."

        "What defines a famine?",
        "It's a technical and bureaucratic term that's unfortunately very emotive in use primarily for political purposes.",
        "The technical definition of a famine really revolves around two different components.",
        "The first is that there has to be an unusually high mortality risk.",
        "Famine is about excess deaths beyond what we would expect in the society usually.",
        "And the second component is that there's a severe threat to food consumption.",
        "And note I said food consumption not food production.",
        "It's not about crop failure.",
        "It's about people being unable to obtain enough food to feed their families.",
        "And that is sometimes due to events like drought, as is presently occurring, but it's often due to other sorts of shocks.",
        "It can be due to mass unemployment.",
        "It can be due to a food price spike.",
        "We happen to have a perfect storm of all of these things happening in places like Southern Somalia and parts of northeastern Kenya right now, hence the proclamation of a famine in Southern Somalia.",
        "And of course people will say it can also be strictly political, as it was in Mao's China or Stalin's Russia at various points.",
        "But the situation here, as you think about, it's not a lack of food, even if food has to come in from the outside.",
        "It's the lack of the ability to distribute it, no?",
        "Absolutely, and you've hit the nub of the issue right on the head, Neal.",
        "The problem isn't that there's no food there.",
        "The problem is that there is both a severe distribution problem because the infrastructure, both the physical infrastructure of roads and airstrips, as well as the institutional infrastructure of insuring the security of shipments, there simply aren't police forces to ensure the convoys aren't raided.",
        "That infrastructure is so deficient that it is extremely expensive and complicated and slow to deliver food.",
        "And the second complicating factor is if you can deliver it, very few people can afford to buy it.",
        "So it has to be gifts.",
        "That's quite all right.",
        "I completely agree with Ted.",
        "And where we focus on Somalia, the ultimate issue here is security of the people and security of relief shipments provided.",
        "This is an extraordinarily difficult task."

        "Yes.",

        "And I think the - what the world needs to do is to get rid of this group, and they can do it, just like they did in Afghanistan and other countries, and Somalis are tired of them, and I think all the Somalis will join the world to get rid of this group once and for all.",
        "You've raised an unfortunate example there, Afghanistan.",
        "We're still in Afghanistan 10 years after we ostensibly got rid of the Taliban and still taking casualties.",
        "Yes, Neal, but it's still - every corner of Afghanistan now can get aid.",
        "You know, there are international troops who are there.",
        "Now we have a group - I mean, AMISOM troops in Mogadishu, and they control only a few blocks of the capital city, 10,000 of them.",

        "It was both at the time.",
        "It was common speech in much of the South, particularly.",
