        "And you have to remember the ships that bring in regular deliveries from the World Food Programme have to be escorted by NATO frigates to avoid being taken by Somali pirates.",
        "Exactly.",
        "But the point I was trying to make is this problem extends well beyond the reach of al-Shabab.",
        "And, for example, let's look at neighboring Ethiopia.",
        "In Ethiopia, four and a half million people of the present 11.2 million in crisis, four and a half million of them live in Ethiopia.",
        "The biggest single group is in Ethiopia, not in Somalia.",
        "And in Ethiopia, however, just as recently as a few years ago, we had another crisis that had 13 million people at risk.",
        "This year, we have even worse climate conditions that we had in that most recent crisis.",
        "And yet, rather than 13 million at risk, we have four and a half million at risk.",
        "Why?",
        "The simplest reason is that the government took seriously the need to put in place effective safety nets so that people were cushioned against, resilient against these sorts of shocks when they hit.",
        "And as a result, there's a major humanitarian problem in Ethiopia, but it's one that the international community feels it can manage.",
        "The government has got an apparatus in place.",
        "The humanitarian organizations can get there.",
        "All of the very complicated access problems that Ted is describing and the very challenging political calculus that's been discussed on Somalia is largely absent in Ethiopia.",
        "That's a problem we can manage if we handle it promptly and we keep preparing the ground so that for future shocks, there's a social safety net and effective markets in place.",
        "And, Ted Koppel, in less than a minute, that also requires an active political will in a time of dire budget conflicts and absent until recently, those pictures of the starving children that Ofeibea Quist-Arcton was telling us about.",
        "Ted Koppel, Willy paints an accurate picture, I think, of the situation.",
        "And people say the most powerful country in the world, we need help immediately.",
        "This is a humanitarian crisis.",
        "Do something.",
        "No, you're absolutely right.",
        "And for every one of the countries where we see this kind of thing happening, there are plenty, unfortunately, of others.",
        "Congo, as I mention often when I'm on this broadcast, is even more of a basket case.",
        "Zimbabwe today is, for a variety of reasons, even more of a basket case.",
        "There are so many needy countries and so little available help.",

        "Having said that, I think we are still on track for the elections for on February 18.",
        "And it's a toss-up whether or not there will be a fair turn out or whether people will stay indoors.",
        "It's not entirely clear whether the terrorists have managed to derail this election or whether it will go ahead, in terms of the numbers.",
        "I understand that there has been calls for international monitors to come in to watch these elections, but it's been difficult to bring them in because of the fighting that's going on there.",
        "Yes and no. I think the polling stations are fairly well protected in terms of potential targets.",
        "I don't think that's a problem.",
        "The serious issue really is that if these election monitors do come in and if they turn around and say the elections are rigged or if they want to do any exit polls and the government doesn't allow them to do the exit polls because the government doesn't want their exit polls clashing with what will be the election results, there could be trouble.",
        "And I think one of the reasons why say, for example, the International Republican Institute has pulled out or the NDI is not coming has to do with this fact that perhaps their polling could be an embarrassment to the government of Pakistan.",
