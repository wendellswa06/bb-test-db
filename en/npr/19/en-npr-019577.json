        "And many of the people, as indeed the woman I spoke to at the Somali-Kenyan border, the Dadaab camp that we've just heard, she and many others were saying we've come to Kenya because at least here we still may be hungry, but we feel safer, and there is peace in Kenya.",
        "So that is the problem facing Somalis.",

        "The United Nations World Food Program started its first airlift today, and it's taking a special nutritious peanut paste especially for malnourished children because as always in this sort of crisis it is young children, children under five, and some a bit older who are suffering the most.",
        "Up in Daadab, in northeastern Kenya by the Somali border, the three camps up there, I saw so many young children and babies, some of them acutely malnourished, other severely malnourished, and of course that takes two forms.",
        "We have the pin-thin matchstick limbs of children with malnutrition, and then the other extreme is the children with their bloated stomachs, (unintelligible), and bloated limbs with skin that looks like war paint coming off.",
        "And when these babies and children are touched, they start screaming because their skins are so sensitive.",
        "So that's what the humanitarian workers in the camps in Dadaab are having to deal with, and also across the border in Ethiopia.",
        "That is the reality.",
        "And of course, the elderly and many, many women.",
        "It was especially women and children that I witnessed, that I saw both in Dadaab and then in Somalia across the border from Ethiopia.",
        "The World Food Program aid is going to those camps.",
        "Is it getting into Somalia?",
        "Oh, it arrived in Mogadishu today, the Somali capital, because apart from the Somalis who were fleeing the drought-hit areas into neighboring countries, as we said into Kenya and Ethiopia, many thousands are also heading towards Mogadishu, the capital, in search of food, shelter and medical care.",

        "Well, it does, but if you don't mind, Neal, before we get there, I wanted to ask Ofeibea a quick question, and if I may parenthetically add how much I've admired her reporting from Africa.",
        "I have heard two different versions of what al-Shabaab has said, on the one hand that they have warned foreign aid agencies to stay out of there, that they don't want them in there, indeed that all this talk of famine is some kind of Western propaganda."
