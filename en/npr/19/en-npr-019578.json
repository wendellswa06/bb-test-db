        "I think it would be - given the fact that the political and governmental infrastructure is still relatively dysfunctional, it's hard for me to imagine that the things that we would provide without a direct hand in how they're distributed and how they're utilized, I think it would be almost fruitless.",
        "John, thanks very much.",
        "I'm not thrilled with your message but thank you very much for providing your expertise.",

        "What defines a famine?",
        "It's a technical and bureaucratic term that's unfortunately very emotive in use primarily for political purposes.",
        "The technical definition of a famine really revolves around two different components.",
        "The first is that there has to be an unusually high mortality risk.",
        "Famine is about excess deaths beyond what we would expect in the society usually.",
        "And the second component is that there's a severe threat to food consumption.",
        "And note I said food consumption not food production.",
        "It's not about crop failure.",
        "It's about people being unable to obtain enough food to feed their families.",
        "And that is sometimes due to events like drought, as is presently occurring, but it's often due to other sorts of shocks.",
        "It can be due to mass unemployment.",
        "It can be due to a food price spike.",
        "We happen to have a perfect storm of all of these things happening in places like Southern Somalia and parts of northeastern Kenya right now, hence the proclamation of a famine in Southern Somalia.",
        "And of course people will say it can also be strictly political, as it was in Mao's China or Stalin's Russia at various points.",
        "But the situation here, as you think about, it's not a lack of food, even if food has to come in from the outside.",
        "It's the lack of the ability to distribute it, no?",
        "Absolutely, and you've hit the nub of the issue right on the head, Neal.",
        "The problem isn't that there's no food there.",
        "The problem is that there is both a severe distribution problem because the infrastructure, both the physical infrastructure of roads and airstrips, as well as the institutional infrastructure of insuring the security of shipments, there simply aren't police forces to ensure the convoys aren't raided.",
        "That infrastructure is so deficient that it is extremely expensive and complicated and slow to deliver food.",
        "And the second complicating factor is if you can deliver it, very few people can afford to buy it.",
        "So it has to be gifts."

        "So we have this combination of it's complicated and expensive to get it there, and the private sector can't do it.",

        "You can buy a Coca-Cola in the most remote villages on Earth that get there entirely through private channels.",

        "Yes.",
        "And the famine and the civil war is taking its toll on the civilians, and now we have this group called al-Shabaab, which is a terrorist group and preventing people from getting aid.",
        "And I think the - what the world needs to do is to get rid of this group, and they can do it, just like they did in Afghanistan and other countries, and Somalis are tired of them, and I think all the Somalis will join the world to get rid of this group once and for all.",
        "You've raised an unfortunate example there, Afghanistan.",
        "We're still in Afghanistan 10 years after we ostensibly got rid of the Taliban and still taking casualties.",
        "Yes, Neal, but it's still - every corner of Afghanistan now can get aid.",
        "You know, there are international troops who are there.",
        "Now we have a group - I mean, AMISOM troops in Mogadishu, and they control only a few blocks of the capital city, 10,000 of them.",
        "But the rest of Southern Somalia is in the hands of al-Shabaab.",
        "And people are dying, and the world's watching people dying.",
        "Al-Shabaab doesn't want any international NGOs to get in there to help people.",
        "So what's the world going to do about that now?",
        "People cannot walk all the way 500 miles to Kenya or Ethiopian borders, and the people need help."

        "But I caution against reducing this to problems of terrorism or the problems of an essentially stateless nation, as is the case in Somalia right now regrettably.",
        "Keep in mind that the U.N.'s declaration of an emergency in this region is a majority outside of Somalia.",
        "They only declared two out of Somalia's 18 regions of famine area, and about two-thirds of the people they say are at risk.",

        "The drought that hit this year was the straw that broke a very weak camel's back.",

        "That's quite all right.",

        "This is an extraordinarily difficult task.",
        "And you have to remember the ships that bring in regular deliveries from the World Food Programme have to be escorted by NATO frigates to avoid being taken by Somali pirates.",
        "Exactly.",
        "But the point I was trying to make is this problem extends well beyond the reach of al-Shabab.",
        "And, for example, let's look at neighboring Ethiopia.",
        "In Ethiopia, four and a half million people of the present 11.2 million in crisis, four and a half million of them live in Ethiopia.",
        "The biggest single group is in Ethiopia, not in Somalia.",
        "And in Ethiopia, however, just as recently as a few years ago, we had another crisis that had 13 million people at risk.",
        "This year, we have even worse climate conditions that we had in that most recent crisis.",
        "And yet, rather than 13 million at risk, we have four and a half million at risk.",
        "Why?",
        "The simplest reason is that the government took seriously the need to put in place effective safety nets so that people were cushioned against, resilient against these sorts of shocks when they hit.",
        "And as a result, there's a major humanitarian problem in Ethiopia, but it's one that the international community feels it can manage."
