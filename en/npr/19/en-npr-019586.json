        "And of course Wikipedia is the one that explains that to me.",
        "But in terms of having too much for an individual to master, we've been there before.",
        "You know, it doesn't really matter with those Google hits if there are 13 pages or hundreds of thousands of pages of hits because you're really only going to look at the first couple, anyway.",
        "That's a good point.",
        "And in that sense, in the 16th century, they really had the sense that there were more books than any one person could master, and they needed shortcuts, basically.",
        "Now, let's talk about what some of those shortcuts were, and then we're going to open up the phones and we're going to talk to Adam from Minneapolis.",
        "Overload has triggered some very practical solutions, dealing with the sorting, locating, selection, haven't they, over the years?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And so I would call reference books the general category of tools that have been around a long time, some of them predated the printing revolution.",
        "But printing certainly made a much broader range of people familiar with what we use still today, alphabetical indexing, for example, outlining detailed table of contents and books that collect what they called the best bits of all those books you wont have time to read yourself.",
        "So some of these are in genres that are now dead, like the florilegium, although \"\"Bartlett's Famous Quotations\"\" is basically a kind of florilegium.",
        "It's a collection of quotables, of quotations by authoritative people.",
        "But it will be sorted by subject heading, so when you want an example or a quotation to put into your composition, whether your conversation or your sermon or a letter or a lecture, you could go to such reference book, look under the heading that was likely to be useful and choose a couple of items.",
        "Okay.",
        "So these come in different scales.",
        "There are smaller ones for, you know, less expensively available, and there are huge ones accumulating up to 10 million words, in this one Magnum Theatrum of 1631, for example.",
        "So you just have to chop the tree down piecemeal to know what it is - to see what it is you're dealing with, as opposed to trying to absorb the entire thing right in front of you."

        "Do you have a question?",
        "Oh, actually it was just - more of a comment.",
        "I really think this is an interesting subject, and it's sort of like watching an old medium being pushed aside like - one way that I like to deal with, like, getting away from the Internet and Twitters and reddits and Facebooks of the digital age is just to kind of like read a book that Ive read a million times or find a smaller medium for the actual media than having to Google it.",
        "I mean, I love reading Wikipedia about movies that I've watched and finding out little secrets about authors and stories behind the actual media, but I think it's important to separate yourself because books are an invaluable resource.",
        "And a lot of people that I know personally, you know, will turn to their e-readers or their droid phones before they'll pick up a book and reference something in it.",
        "So I think that's really important.",
        "Adam, thank you very much for the call.",
        "Are we seeing, Ann, are we not, sort of an evolution then in the process of culling information and how we do it?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "We're relying more and more on computers to do it, but I'd argue that we really need, as Adam was suggesting, to use our own minds to do it.",
        "Whether you're, you know, mainly reading from a physical book or from an e-reader, the key thing is to keep - set your own center of focus and attention so that you can come out with something that's good for you.",
        "Of course, we all also derive pleasure and sometimes benefit from just sort of following the lead of a webpage, but I think you need to do both.",

        "I got a quick question.",
        "Basically, you know, this subject of having so much information out there.",
        "I find sometimes, if I'm researching a subject or an issue that pertains to my life, I'm overwhelmed with just the amount of different, you know, whether it be quote, unquote, facts or opinions.",
        "I can basically search for any answer I want and I'll find, you know, for example, is coffee good for me?",
        "You can search, you know, coffee is good for you or you can search coffee is bad for you, you know, and you'll get positive answers on each side of the spectrum.",
        "My question is, how do you filter all these different quote, unquote, whether they be facts of opinions, and run that through a filter so you can basically get a good idea of how to solve a problem or, you know, form an opinion of your own?",
        "Shaun, thank you very much for that.",
        "That's an interesting question, Ann.",
        "It's almost one of accuracy versus quantity, huh?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "That question has been around from the very beginning, and in the early modern period, the pedagogues would teach what they called judicium: judgment.",
        "That's what you want to impart to every child, and you train them by having them read the good stuff so that when they come across the bad stuff they'll have the judgments to tell the difference.",
        "And I suppose we are constantly doing that ourselves.",
        "I, as an educator, I think that contact with teachers and, of course, parents and - is invaluable in helping form judgment about what's a reasonable answer, what's - as the kind of question you can expect to get an easy answer on.",
        "Many questions have very nuanced answers and you need to have the nuance and both sides of the issue be present in your mind even as you might, you know, go forward with a preference.",
        "So I think, you know, old fashion methods of education still must count for a lot.",
        "And of course, there are websites and websites.",
        "And so you need to have the skills to evaluate the context of what you're reading, where it's coming from, who's made the website, what's their purpose in doing, you know, in pushing this line and...",
        "I'd like to - I want to explore this with you a little bit deeper, if I may.",
        "And the reason is, as a journalist, we are taught that, you know, you get at least three sources before - to verify something.",
        "And the Internet has now made it - as our callers have indicated, and as you have as well - that that may or may not be sufficient anymore because it depends on which three sources you may get."

        "Right.",
        "So personally, I tend to go for my librarys website, which has access to, you know, certain - basically their reference works that are online that have - and of course, being an academic, these would bear on the issues that I teach about, like science and religion or the history of early modern Europe.",
        "But there will be good reference books in just about any topic.",

        "You know, instead of maybe 20 pages, you'll only get two.",
        "But you have to apply it the right away because if you apply it the wrong way, you don't find what you want.",
        "So you kind of have to understand the stuff you're working with, the technical stuff, a little bit in order to find the information you want without getting overloaded.",
        "Terry, thank you very much for the call.",
        "His call reminds me, Ann, of something I hear people saying a lot.",
        "What did we do before computers?",
        "How did we handle this?",
