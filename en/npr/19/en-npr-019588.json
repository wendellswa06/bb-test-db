        "It's greatly appreciated.",
        "Earl, let me start with you.",
        "One of the things that we want to make sure, we are not striking out specifically against Reverend Jackson and Reverend Sharpton, but we wanted to take a closer look at the idea of whether black leadership is failing, whether or not they are, in fact, in tune with much of black America in dealing with the issues of import to the majority of African-Americans in this country.",

        "Well, two things.",

        "Antonio Villaraigosa is now the mayor of the city.",
        "And even though certainly he's an important elected official, no one says that he is the Latino leader for all of America.",
        "So we come back to black leadership.",
        "When you look at it, we have all kinds of shades and grades of points of view, opinions.",
        "We have different classes, we have different religious groups and interests.",
        "We span the spectrum in terms of our community.",
        "We have different organizations that meet different kinds of needs, both nationally and locally.",
        "So, essentially, that leader, or leadership, I should say, is really diffuse and dispersed and there are a lot of different areas I think where leadership, such as it is, both local, state and national can step up to the plate.",
        "So, again, it's really a huge burden just to say we have the monolithic one-dimensional, one leader or one size fits all.",
        "I think it spans the spectrum, and that's the way it should with African-Americans, just like with any other group.",
        "Yet, Professor, that being said, many of these people have taken on, quite frankly, the mantle of leadership, at least they are ofttimes in the fore of issues of import.",
        "I pose the same question to you.",
        "Do you believe, based on what you have seen in the last few years in particular, whether these groups, organizations and people are servicing the needs and wants of the African-American community?",
        "Well, I think they're trying to, but I think they face--African-American leadership, African-American people face a very, very difficult situation at this time.",
        "The agenda of black America requires, to put it in simple terms, liberal progressive reform.",
        "And the present political climate, the control of the national administration is not hospitable to those kinds of changes.",
        "So I think for that reason, you find African-American leaders engaging in this kind of, to use the phrase your guest used, manufactured kinds of symbolic issues because they really cannot deliver on the substantive agenda.",
        "Earl, one of the things that's interesting and a number of people talk about present day is that unlike the civil rights days, there isn't necessarily that one issue that sticks out and is across the board something that all African-Americans grapple with and are concerned about present day and that because of that, leaders are finding it harder to pin a particular issue down and carry the flag for it.",
        "Any credence in that?",
        "Walk us through what he said.",
