        "The Capoeira Angola Center is on quiet suburban block, in a row of anonymous apartment buildings.",
        "It's mixed among houses, schools, and churches, all situated near Crenshaw and Lamer Park, two of L.A.'s oldest black neighborhoods.",
        "Inside the center, capoeiristas are gathering for an annual conference honoring the art.",
        "They're wearing all white, or yellow and black; T-shirts are tucked in neatly with the names of capoeira schools in places like L.A., Texas, and Salvador written proudly across the chest.",
        "They sit together in a circle, knees tucked under their chin, like scouts around a campfire.",
        "And, at the top of the ring where the storyteller might be, half a dozen capoeiristas press together across a bench, holding various instruments.",
        "There's a single, small, empty space between them.",
        "Mestre Joao Grande limps over slowly.",
        "Like a king at the start of a chess match, he is seated right in the middle.",
        "He leans his sturdy square frame back, and taps his beating bow.",
        "The others fall in.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "Joao Grande begins to sing in a tradition that is likely as old as capoeira itself, the latiania(ph), or litany.",
        "The latiania is the epitome of a capoeirista's respect, devotion, and humility, expressed through music.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "My God is great, Joao Grande is saying.",
        "God is great, and I am small.",
        "The others listen, some with their eyes closed and heads nodding.",
        "The theme continues.",
        "In the circle of capoeira, the lyrics go, I am very small.",

        "Long live my master.",
        "Long live everyone's masters, and long live the great capoeiristas.",
        "Then, the mestre gives an approving nod, and two students crouching his feet enter the circle, and begin to play capoeira.",
        "Joao Grande observes the exchange from under his thick, bushy brows.",
        "He's looking with the same eyes that were first enchanted by capoeira in a Brazilian country town, more than half a century ago.",
        "The elder mestre watches and smiles like a young man in the most innocent kind of love.",
        "His student, Omo Ade, knows why."

        "And amidst all that chaos sat the fertility clinic of New Orleans, and 1,400 embryos unprotected.",
        "That is, Alex, until a doctor named Belinda \"\"Sissy\"\" Sartor and her team climbed into some boats and rescued the embryos.",

        "That is correct.",

        "Well, I ended up putting in a call to State Representative John Alario, and he called the governor and coordinated something with the Louisiana State police.",
        "And we worked together, and from there were able to get the mission completed.",
        "And so there was still some water.",

        "On the morning that we rescued the embryos, we initially met at a Louisiana State police office and then went to the staging area.",
        "And then three trucks pulling boats - which are what the Illinois Conservation Police were manning - and an Army convoy truck, headed to a location on land that we could launch into water to reach the clinic.",

        "Because I mean they'd gone through sort of a lot of medical stuff to even get these embryos to the point where they were, right?",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "Most patients were very joyful over hearing that news.",
        "Some had failed in their initial attempts, and so this was going to give them another chance to conceive.",
        "At the present time, we have eight pregnancies from that group of embryos that were rescued.",

        "Now you have so many issues out there at the national level and the local level, all the way from HIV-AIDS, failing public schools, certainly unemployment, the criminal justice system, young African-American men that are falling beneath the cracks as at-risk youths, issues of gender now.",
        "You know, these things weren't front and center 30 or 40 years ago.",
        "So now that suggests, once again, it can't be a \"\"leadership\"\", quote, unquote, where one size fits all.",
        "The issues are so dispersed, so diffuse and so impacting on specific groups among African-Americans, you're going to have to see and you are seeing different types of leaders, different kinds and brands of leadership and leaderships pointing specifically now at those specific needs.",

        "Is the leadership failing?",
        "Not so much the failing, it's just the issues have changed and the times have changed.",
        "Yet, Professor, what I hear as I travel across the country, and then pick up on your point, is that many people have said to me, `I don't want another summit.",
        "I don't want to see another meeting.",
        "I don't want to see another group of black, quote, \"\"leaders\"\" stand up before us and say that they've met without a real agenda and anything moving forward' and the criticism is that they just want to find headlines.",
        "I think there's something to that.",
        "But back to Earl's point, I think, in general, that's correct, but there's something--the black leadership has recognized since the end of the civil rights era, indeed, before, that the core issue, the central issue confronting the African-American community is joblessness--jobs, jobs, jobs.",
        "Most of the problems of the black community as a community flow from this high, persistent level of unemployment.",
        "The march on Washington in 1963, after all, was a march for jobs and freedom.",
        "And the target since then has been full employment, full employment.",
        "It is very, very difficult to get the political system to deliver on that objective, but I think that is the primary item on the African-American agenda that has to be addressed by the black community and its leadership and by the political system.",
        "So, Earl, could not we take an issue, a quagmire like the economic situation, the job situation for the black community and have these disparate leaders come together, forge, as they have ofttimes said they would after these summits and these meetings, and I've attended many of them, an alliance to tackle a particular problem like the one the professor just outlined?"
