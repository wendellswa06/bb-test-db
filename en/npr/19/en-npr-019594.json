        "Well, that's the ideal.",
        "Certainly, when you look at the dire strait of our economic plight, especially with young African-American males, I mean, double and triple the unemployment of young white males, I mean, obvious case can be made that that's a point of attack that should be a unifying force for all.",
        "I would also probably add a couple of other things, too.",
        "I think also we've got a serious, serious problem with the criminal justice system.",
        "You've got one million African-American men, and increasingly women, behind bars in this country.",
        "And also HIV-AIDS; huge problem that has resonance not only locally but nationally in our community.",
        "So once again, the problem, Ed and Robert, is, yes, there are some big-ticket, hot-button crisis issues there, not just one, but I think a multiplicity of those issues.",
        "And, yes, in theory, you can bring the leadership together, different organizations, to rally around those issues, but the problem is, as you said before, I don't want to go to another summit.",
        "I don't want to go to another meeting.",
        "I don't want to go to another planning session where we got some camera action, some reporter's notepads but nothing comes out of that.",
        "I just simply think this: No matter whether it's a big-ticket issue or a little-ticket issue, what's going to have to happen is local leadership--and much of the leadership now is being framed, as issues are, at the local level--I think there, that's the starting point for engaging a larger number of African-Americans around an action program on these issues, not...",
        "And frank...",
        "...necessarily nationally.",
        "And frankly, that's always been the case when we've seen true movement.",
        "Professor, do we perhaps too often romanticize black leadership of the past?",
        "I think to some extent, but black leadership of the past, from the NAACP from its beginning and then the leadership of Dr. King, had a strategic plan, a strategic objective.",
        "And that was worked on and developed year after year after year until it reached fruition.",
        "Black leadership today does not have that kind of strategic plan.",
        "It's not working day by day, year by year, using multiple methods to achieve an objective.",
        "They don't really have--excuse me--have an agenda.",
        "I think that agenda is--what should be on that agenda is reasonably clear and then pressure, pressure, pressure using a variety of methods, variety of tactics, has to be brought on what really is a hostile political system at this point.",
        "So we need a summit.",
        "We need a summit to develop that kind of collective strategy.",
        "I don't know whether it can be done, but that's clearly what is needed.",
        "And, Earl, quickly for me, if you will, if we take these people individually and organizations, like the NAACP, the Urban League, the SCLC and others, is it fair to say as a community--and we look at the dire straits you talked about--is it fair to say to these folks, whether you do it collectively or individually, you've got to get in gear and move a little quicker than we've seen?",
        "You know, the fire department didn't comment about that to me.",
        "But it is a often talked about problem in New York City.",
        "I'm not exactly sure how the city or the mayor's office will be responding to it at this time.",
        "I think it is, because let's face it, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton did go to Mexico, they did meet with Mexican President Vicente Fox.",
        "They did pose themselves as a voice of black America.",
        "So if that is indeed the case and the NAACP, SCLC and the Urban League and others do pose themselves as the authentic voice of black America, rightly or wrongly, correctly or incorrectly, I think then that brings a responsibility on their part to indeed be that voice, engage the political structure, the economic structure and indeed serve, at least to the extent that they can, the needs and the interests of a broad spectrum of African-Americans.",
        "I don't think it's an unfair demand since they've put themselves in that position.",
        "All right.",
        "Professor Robert Smith of San Francisco State University, the political science department, and author of \"\"We Have No Leaders,\"\" and political analyst and commentator Earl Ofari Hutchinson, thank you both for joining us.",
        "Greatly appreciate it."
