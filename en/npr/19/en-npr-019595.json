        "I spoke with a representative from the fire department, and he said it's always harder to fight a fire in the cold.",
        "And last night, it was really cold, and it was also very windy.",

        "We do know that the plot didn't get much further than sort of agreement in chat rooms - so there wasn't explosives, they hadn't done the reconnaissance - it was just enough for the government to say this is a serious threat because these guys have, have made an agreement.",
