        "Yeah.",
        "Walk us through what he said.",
        "So President Trump told The New York Times' Michael Schmidt that he expects Robert Mueller to treat him fairly but that the investigation, in the president's words, quote, \"\"make the country look very bad, and it puts the country in a very bad position.\"\" And Trump, David, in this interview insists 16 times that Mueller has found, what he says, is no collusion between his campaign and Russia.",
        "Only 16 times.",
        "Only 16 times.",
        "Of course, we don't know that yet because the special counsel investigation is, of course, not yet over.",
        "But the president is framing this as bad for the country.",
        "He says so the sooner it's worked out, the better it is for the country.",
        "Those are the president's words.",
        "Interesting he says that Mueller's going to treat him fairly because a lot of his allies have been suggesting that there's bias within the FBI and within Mueller's camp.",
        "So he seems to be getting away from some of his allies in that respect.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He - 16 times talking about collusion, talking about Mueller, talking about how he thinks this investigation looks.",
        "You cover this White House.",

        "Ty Cobb, one of the president's lawyers, said that the Russia probe would be likely finished shortly sometime in the new year.",
        "But that, of course, does not seem to be the case.",
        "Legal experts - I think also historical precedent suggests that this investigation could last well into 2018 - perhaps even into the midterm elections, which, of course, presents a whole, you know, different sort of political problems for this president.",
        "I think the biggest question, looking into next year, is when will the president sit and be interviewed by the special counsel.",
        "I can tell you that as of last week that interview had not yet happened, according to a source familiar.",
        "But legal experts I've spoken with say that they fully expect the president to sit for an interview with the special counsel.",
        "They say it's highly unlikely that this investigation could conclude without that happening.",

        "Did you learn anything about this president?",
        "Well, I learned that the president - these are the sort of situations in which the president feels most comfortable talking to reporters, right?",
        "It was this impromptu interview happening around a table at the golf course, where the president had just finished golfing with some of his friends.",
        "He's in his comfort zone.",
        "His comfort zone - and what's interesting about it is this.",

        "The entire White House Press Corps is able to ask questions.",
        "They're able to ask follow-up questions if an answer seems a little evasive.",
        "The president saw fit to give this interview on his own terms to Michael Schmidt.",
        "Of course, this is a president who finds it politically useful to discredit media organizations, including The New York Times.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Of course, there is always a disconnect between what he says and what he does.",
        "This president, of course, giving this one-on-one interview, again, to the New York Times.",
