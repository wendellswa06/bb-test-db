        "And my stepfather's interview was so dark that I worried, and indeed, he overdosed the next day.",
        "And because this had happened about six years earlier, my mother said to him, I'm so sorry, but I simply cannot go through with this again.",
        "And she divorced him, sold him her house and moved 600 miles away.",
        "So, that becomes sort of the through-line of the book.",

        "And it occurred to me that, yeah, all of these recipes - they were just - they were slight variations on the same recipe.",
