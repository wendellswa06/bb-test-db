        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "No, it's not the sole province of the old, by any means.",
        "And - nor am I saying that everyone over the age of 70 is wise.",
        "I'm simply saying that - well, you know, what's fascinating to me is that in the last century, we added three decades to the human life expectancy.",
        "So, suddenly, we do find ourselves with what some people are calling \"\"the bonus years.",
        "And it is kind of changing things.",
        "Look at writers like Philip Roth or John Updike or Joan Didion.",
        "These - you know, these folks are all doing some of the best work of their lives.",
        "And you know, they're all of a certain age - or the sculptress, Louise Bourgeois.",
        "So, yeah, so it really has changed things up.",
        "And I think that what I'm trying to do with the book is I'm trying to say that - I think that it's important that we celebrate this fact because more people should be doing stuff with their lives at this age.",
        "Here's some more of our responses to our email challenge.",
        "This from Peter - I prefer wisdom balances on the edge of a knife, but if you insist on the \"\"wisdom is\"\" formulation, I would make it wisdom is in balance on the edge of a knife.",
        "This one from Mark in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.",
        "Forgive me for not following format, but that I've always found that the wisest people usually are those with the least amount of formal education.",
        "They have learned their lessons the hard way, by experiencing them personally and painfully, which leads us to this question by email from David in North Fork, California - what's the difference between being wise and being smart?",
        "Well, being smart is a quantitative kind of intelligence.",
        "That's more about results, whereas wisdom is more about - it's harder to quantify and it's more about being able to understand or perceive universal principles.",
        "And interestingly, that's the big divide in the study of wisdom - is between eastern and western ideas of wisdom, because here, in the West, of course, it's - wisdom is about linear thinking.",
        "It's more logical.",
        "And in eastern cultures, it's a much more intuitive subject.",
        "It's more about the process, rather than the result.",
        "Let's get James on the line, James with us from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.",
        "Yes.",
        "I'm a professor in oceanography at LSU, and I believe that there are - is perhaps confusing wisdom and experience here, to some degree.",
        "I mean, right now I think that - for one of the biggest issues that we're facing right now in the world is probably global climate change.",
        "And we are basing our decisions - a lot of our thinking about it on short-term economic issues, when what we really needs to be doing is thinking about making changes that won't pay off for 100 or 1000 years.",
        "And as a species, we're not really evolutionarily well-equipped to deal with that.",
        "And I think to me, being able to recognize those kinds of fundamental needs in the way we approach things is true wisdom.",
        "It's not necessarily empirical wisdom, it's truly a way of organizing and recognizing a new way of thinking that may be required to move forward in the future.",
        "James, do you find that an example of that linear western thinking?",
        "Well, I think it's critical thinking.",
        "And I think it is somewhat empirical - as a scientist, I'm trained that way.",
        "But one of the things that seems to me, as we move forward with the issues, such as ecosystem space management, which is what we're really going to have to do to tackle the global climate issues are we have to start thinking about payoffs that probably won't be realized for 1000 years or 500 years.",
        "But when you actually talk to someone and you talk - and they speak in the long term, they generally say, well, I want, you know, I want it to be conditions like my grandchildren.",
        "I want my grandchildren to have the same opportunities I have, or my grandchildren's grandchildren.",
        "That's about as far forward as humans seem to be able to think."

        "And interestingly, one of the commonalities amongst those folks were that the spouses were able to overlook their partner's problems, that they had learned how to sort of deal with the background hum of the person they were living with.",
        "So, yeah, I think that's a huge component of this - of wisdom is this idea of knowing that, you know, not only are you yourself riddled with faults, but the other guy is, too, and so you've got to somehow factor that in.",
