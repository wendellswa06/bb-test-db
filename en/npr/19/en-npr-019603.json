        "Yet, Professor, that being said, many of these people have taken on, quite frankly, the mantle of leadership, at least they are ofttimes in the fore of issues of import.",
        "I pose the same question to you.",
        "Do you believe, based on what you have seen in the last few years in particular, whether these groups, organizations and people are servicing the needs and wants of the African-American community?",
        "Well, I think they're trying to, but I think they face--African-American leadership, African-American people face a very, very difficult situation at this time.",
        "The agenda of black America requires, to put it in simple terms, liberal progressive reform.",
        "And the present political climate, the control of the national administration is not hospitable to those kinds of changes.",
        "So I think for that reason, you find African-American leaders engaging in this kind of, to use the phrase your guest used, manufactured kinds of symbolic issues because they really cannot deliver on the substantive agenda.",
        "Earl, one of the things that's interesting and a number of people talk about present day is that unlike the civil rights days, there isn't necessarily that one issue that sticks out and is across the board something that all African-Americans grapple with and are concerned about present day and that because of that, leaders are finding it harder to pin a particular issue down and carry the flag for it.",
        "Any credence in that?",
        "ST. VINCENT: (Singing) It's not the end.",
        "It's not the end.",
        "I mean, how could that possibly be as important as some of the challenges that we face here at home?",
        "I don't see it.",
        "Now I may be wrong, completely, with that, but I just think this is a matter of get in the cameras, it's manufactured outrage, it will have no meaning whatsoever to the vast majority of black people and the strategy that people will adapt for themselves for how they will live into the future.",
        "It will mean nothing.",
        "We decided to take a closer look at what Nat calls manufactured outrage and to also look at the state of black leadership in this country.",
        "Joining us now are Robert Smith, professor of political science at San Francisco State University and the author of \"\"We Have No Leaders.\"\" And in our NPR West studios, political analyst and commentator Earl Ofari Hutchinson.",
        "Gentlemen, I thank you for joining us.",
        "It's greatly appreciated.",
        "Earl, let me start with you.",
        "One of the things that we want to make sure, we are not striking out specifically against Reverend Jackson and Reverend Sharpton, but we wanted to take a closer look at the idea of whether black leadership is failing, whether or not they are, in fact, in tune with much of black America in dealing with the issues of import to the majority of African-Americans in this country.",
        "What's your thought?",
        "Well, two things.",
        "Number one, even when you use the term black leadership, that's a misnomer right there.",
        "That's a heavy burden, really, to put on any group.",
        "When you really think about it, we don't say the Latino leader, we don't say the Asian-American leader, we don't say the Jewish-American leader, certainly we don't say the white leader.",
        "We just had an election in Los Angeles.",
        "Antonio Villaraigosa is now the mayor of the city.",
        "And even though certainly he's an important elected official, no one says that he is the Latino leader for all of America.",
        "So we come back to black leadership.",
        "When you look at it, we have all kinds of shades and grades of points of view, opinions.",
        "We have different classes, we have different religious groups and interests.",
        "We span the spectrum in terms of our community.",
        "We have different organizations that meet different kinds of needs, both nationally and locally.",
        "So, essentially, that leader, or leadership, I should say, is really diffuse and dispersed and there are a lot of different areas I think where leadership, such as it is, both local, state and national can step up to the plate.",
        "So, again, it's really a huge burden just to say we have the monolithic one-dimensional, one leader or one size fits all.",
        "I think it spans the spectrum, and that's the way it should with African-Americans, just like with any other group."

        "Now you have so many issues out there at the national level and the local level, all the way from HIV-AIDS, failing public schools, certainly unemployment, the criminal justice system, young African-American men that are falling beneath the cracks as at-risk youths, issues of gender now.",
        "You know, these things weren't front and center 30 or 40 years ago.",
        "So now that suggests, once again, it can't be a \"\"leadership\"\", quote, unquote, where one size fits all.",
        "The issues are so dispersed, so diffuse and so impacting on specific groups among African-Americans, you're going to have to see and you are seeing different types of leaders, different kinds and brands of leadership and leaderships pointing specifically now at those specific needs.",
        "So that's where we're--many people are saying, `Well, wait a minute, have the leaders failed?",
        "Is the leadership failing?",
        "Not so much the failing, it's just the issues have changed and the times have changed.",

        "That's at npr.org.",
        "Just click on Talk of the Nation.",
        "I think there's something to that.",
        "But back to Earl's point, I think, in general, that's correct, but there's something--the black leadership has recognized since the end of the civil rights era, indeed, before, that the core issue, the central issue confronting the African-American community is joblessness--jobs, jobs, jobs.",
        "Most of the problems of the black community as a community flow from this high, persistent level of unemployment.",
        "The march on Washington in 1963, after all, was a march for jobs and freedom.",
        "And the target since then has been full employment, full employment.",
        "It is very, very difficult to get the political system to deliver on that objective, but I think that is the primary item on the African-American agenda that has to be addressed by the black community and its leadership and by the political system.",
        "So, Earl, could not we take an issue, a quagmire like the economic situation, the job situation for the black community and have these disparate leaders come together, forge, as they have ofttimes said they would after these summits and these meetings, and I've attended many of them, an alliance to tackle a particular problem like the one the professor just outlined?",
        "Well, that's the ideal.",
        "Certainly, when you look at the dire strait of our economic plight, especially with young African-American males, I mean, double and triple the unemployment of young white males, I mean, obvious case can be made that that's a point of attack that should be a unifying force for all.",
        "I would also probably add a couple of other things, too.",

        "They did pose themselves as a voice of black America.",
        "So if that is indeed the case and the NAACP, SCLC and the Urban League and others do pose themselves as the authentic voice of black America, rightly or wrongly, correctly or incorrectly, I think then that brings a responsibility on their part to indeed be that voice, engage the political structure, the economic structure and indeed serve, at least to the extent that they can, the needs and the interests of a broad spectrum of African-Americans.",
