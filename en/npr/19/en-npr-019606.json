        "Hi.",
        "Joanne, go ahead please.",
        "OK, I was asked a question - where do I find wisdom?",

        "I have a young married daughter in her mid-30s.",
        "And I go to her, you know, I do have history enough to have - you know, I mean, it seems to me as if, when we get older, there's a certain amount of insight that comes our way.",
        "And it's not because we're smarter or anything else.",
        "I think that we have time to be more reflective in the way that we look at things.",
        "We look at more the, you know, resolution, you know, down the road.",
        "How is this going to…",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "You know, affect whatever it is that we're doing.",
        "Right?",
        "Whereas kids - well, young married people, now they have to make decisions quickly.",
        "You know, right now.",
        "What is going to be the resolution to this quickly?",
        "So, that wisdom comes from history.",
        "And I know you had said - you'd made a comment earlier about, well, so many things that are happening are happening in a different way now.",
        "So, how can we know?",
        "Not really, you know?",
        "They always say everything has already been done once at least.",
        "At least.",
        "You know, nothing is new.",
        "You know, so we're going through an economical kind of situation right now.",
        "But I mean, back in the '20s it was bad, you know?",
        "Back in the '60s it was bad.",
        "It's been bad before, you know.",
        "Different names to it, different situations occurred to put us in that bad place.",
        "But this is just different, but it's kind of the same.",
        "Joanne, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Sure.",
        "Bye.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "You also concede, Henry Alford, that wisdom us hardly the exclusive province of the old.",
        "Well, the irony is that - yes, that it comes at the same time that all of your bodily infirmities come.",
        "So, that's a tricky combination.",
        "As Joanne was just saying, on the one hand, older folks have more time to be reflective.",
        "And indeed, I think that's part of what helps them to be so wise.",
        "But it might also be a time when your health has really gone south.",
        "So, yeah, that's part of the conflict there."

        "And - nor am I saying that everyone over the age of 70 is wise.",
        "I'm simply saying that - well, you know, what's fascinating to me is that in the last century, we added three decades to the human life expectancy.",
        "So, suddenly, we do find ourselves with what some people are calling \"\"the bonus years.",
        "And it is kind of changing things.",

        "This from Peter - I prefer wisdom balances on the edge of a knife, but if you insist on the \"\"wisdom is\"\" formulation, I would make it wisdom is in balance on the edge of a knife.",
        "This one from Mark in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.",
        "Forgive me for not following format, but that I've always found that the wisest people usually are those with the least amount of formal education.",
        "They have learned their lessons the hard way, by experiencing them personally and painfully, which leads us to this question by email from David in North Fork, California - what's the difference between being wise and being smart?",
        "Well, being smart is a quantitative kind of intelligence.",
        "That's more about results, whereas wisdom is more about - it's harder to quantify and it's more about being able to understand or perceive universal principles.",
        "And interestingly, that's the big divide in the study of wisdom - is between eastern and western ideas of wisdom, because here, in the West, of course, it's - wisdom is about linear thinking.",
        "It's more logical.",
        "And in eastern cultures, it's a much more intuitive subject.",
        "It's more about the process, rather than the result.",

        "And there're some people who are and some people who aren't.",
        "Yes.",
        "I'm a professor in oceanography at LSU, and I believe that there are - is perhaps confusing wisdom and experience here, to some degree.",
        "I mean, right now I think that - for one of the biggest issues that we're facing right now in the world is probably global climate change.",
        "And we are basing our decisions - a lot of our thinking about it on short-term economic issues, when what we really needs to be doing is thinking about making changes that won't pay off for 100 or 1000 years.",
        "And as a species, we're not really evolutionarily well-equipped to deal with that.",
        "And I think to me, being able to recognize those kinds of fundamental needs in the way we approach things is true wisdom.",
        "It's not necessarily empirical wisdom, it's truly a way of organizing and recognizing a new way of thinking that may be required to move forward in the future."

        "But one of the things that seems to me, as we move forward with the issues, such as ecosystem space management, which is what we're really going to have to do to tackle the global climate issues are we have to start thinking about payoffs that probably won't be realized for 1000 years or 500 years.",

        "James, thanks very much and all of us can wish you nothing but the best of luck (Laughing) in resolving the situation.",

        "And interestingly, one of the commonalities amongst those folks were that the spouses were able to overlook their partner's problems, that they had learned how to sort of deal with the background hum of the person they were living with.",
        "So, yeah, I think that's a huge component of this - of wisdom is this idea of knowing that, you know, not only are you yourself riddled with faults, but the other guy is, too, and so you've got to somehow factor that in.",
        "One of the people you talked to is sort of known to public radio listeners and that is the father of Sandra Tsing Loh, the commentator and - who's appeared many times on This American life and other things.",

        "And yeah, that kind of stuff - it's, you know, it's fascinating to behold, but you've got to understand that when Sandra was growing up, you know, she was a teenage girl and her father was doing this stuff, or her father would, you know, he liked to hitchhike instead of drive.",
        "So, here was this 13-year-old girl who he had stashed behind a bush while he was trying to pick up a ride for the two of them.",
