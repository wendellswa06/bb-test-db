        "He was known for taking on corruption.",
        "There was a peaceful transfer of power.",
        "What happened?",
        "When President Wade came to power in 2000 - and it was on a wave of popular support, especially amongst youths - what the analysts say is that he continued this glowing reputation of Senegal as a bastion of democracy and stability in West Africa; but that in his second term, he had suddenly decided that he wants to cling to power, and that it's a different Wade.",
        "Although he has achieved some things, like building infrastructure and roads, and so on, there is huge criticism that he's trying to impose his son, Karim Wade, who is a mega-minister in his father's government, as his successor as president.",
        "This is what the Senegalese are saying absolutely no to.",
        "And it's not just the politicians.",
        "It's ordinary Senegalese who say, no, we will choose our new president.",
        "It's not up to you, President Wade, to choose.",
        "And also they're saying, how come the people around you are enriching themselves?",
        "That is not what we elected you for.",
        "We elected you to ensure a better life for all Senegalese, jobs and opportunities, and that is not what has happened.",
        "Lastly, you talk about Senegal is a bastion of democracy.",
        "It's one of the oldest democracies in Africa.",
        "What does this highly contested campaign mean for the country?",
        "I think it has surprised the Senegalese.",
        "This is a stable and generally peaceful nation, but I think Senegalese were surprised to see themselves on the streets.",
        "And the fury in their faces - especially amongst the youth, who were hurling rocks at the riot police.",
        "They say, we have had enough of Wade.",
        "Twelve years ago, he symbolized change and a better future for Senegal.",
        "That is not what has happened.",
        "It's time to choose someone else.",
        "NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton, speaking with us from Dakar, Senegal.",

        "The Reverends Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton say Mexico's President Vicente Fox should apologize to African-Americans for saying Mexicans take jobs not even blacks would want to do.",
        "Both ministers went to Mexico to tell Fox that African-Americans were outraged.",
        "Earlier this week, we ask our roundtable guests whether blacks were served by all the time spent on this issue.",

        "I mean, how could that possibly be as important as some of the challenges that we face here at home?",
        "I don't see it.",
        "Now I may be wrong, completely, with that, but I just think this is a matter of get in the cameras, it's manufactured outrage, it will have no meaning whatsoever to the vast majority of black people and the strategy that people will adapt for themselves for how they will live into the future.",
        "It will mean nothing.",
        "We decided to take a closer look at what Nat calls manufactured outrage and to also look at the state of black leadership in this country.",
        "Joining us now are Robert Smith, professor of political science at San Francisco State University and the author of \"\"We Have No Leaders.\"\" And in our NPR West studios, political analyst and commentator Earl Ofari Hutchinson.",
        "Gentlemen, I thank you for joining us.",
        "It's greatly appreciated.",
        "Earl, let me start with you.",
        "One of the things that we want to make sure, we are not striking out specifically against Reverend Jackson and Reverend Sharpton, but we wanted to take a closer look at the idea of whether black leadership is failing, whether or not they are, in fact, in tune with much of black America in dealing with the issues of import to the majority of African-Americans in this country.",
        "What's your thought?",
        "Well, two things.",
        "Number one, even when you use the term black leadership, that's a misnomer right there.",
        "That's a heavy burden, really, to put on any group.",
        "When you really think about it, we don't say the Latino leader, we don't say the Asian-American leader, we don't say the Jewish-American leader, certainly we don't say the white leader.",
        "We just had an election in Los Angeles.",
        "Antonio Villaraigosa is now the mayor of the city.",
        "And even though certainly he's an important elected official, no one says that he is the Latino leader for all of America.",
        "So while he's very impressed by the role that American forces have played and impressed by the leadership that General Petraeus showed in turning that situation around as you said, there were many factors including Muqtada al Sadr's position, the sons of Iraq coming around and changing their role in the fight.",
        "But more importantly, the fundamental measure of merit which was political transformation hasn't occurred and the only way to do that, Senator Obama argues is to make it clear that we're going to be withdrawing U.S.",
        "forces but we have to do it as responsibly as possible and be as responsible getting out as we were irresponsible getting in.",
        "Well, it wasn't that they met - didn't meet my expectations.",
        "It was simply that I found that in approaching people, there were some folks whose life narratives really needed to be explored at depth, and those two were not necessarily ones.",
        "But you'd expected the school teacher to - her explanation to be sunny, and it was not.",
        "And you'd expected Phyllis Diller to have a, perhaps, darker look at the world, but she was relentlessly upbeat.",
        "Exactly.",
        "No, that was the fun part of this whole quest was that there were so many surprises.",
        "My favorite one that I found was the - a fisherman in the Indonesian islands who is a member of the Moken tribe.",
        "And these folks can hold their breath underwater twice as long as most humans.",
        "And he - they learn to swim before they walk.",
        "And he noticed all these forebodings of danger on the morning of the tsunami in 2003.",
        "And he told his tribe to climb a local mountain.",
        "And in so doing, he saved thousands of lives.",
        "Hmm.",
        "He could have had no pattern recognition for that once-in-a-thousand-years tsunami?"
