        "I just wanted to bring Henry Alford back in.",
        "Delayed gratification - easy to think about the long-term, harder to enact it.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Yeah, and I think that that speaks to the principle of non-attachment that I was talking about before - this idea that you can't sort of fixate on the short-term results, but that you need to let go, as it were, and take the long view.",
        "James, thanks very much and all of us can wish you nothing but the best of luck (Laughing) in resolving the situation.",
        "Well, I think it's going to be a fundamental change that has to occur if we're going to be able to get at some of these longer-term issues, because we're just not equipped right now to think that way.",
        "Thanks again.",
        "Happy New Year.",
        "You, too.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "We're talking about wisdom with Henry Alford, the author of \"\"How to Live: A Search for Wisdom from Old People.\"\" You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And I wanted to go through some more of our email challenge responders.",
        "Susan in Patterson, California - wisdom is understanding not only your own limitations, but respecting the limitations of those you love.",
        "This from Al.",
        "Wisdom is knowing that you are not as smart or as wise as you thought you were.",
        "Wisdom is listening, emails Lanie(ph).",
        "And then from, well, Scott in Oregon - wisdom is intelligence moderated by experience.",
        "And Henry Alford, that seems to be - get a lot of things in a small capsule.",
        "Indeed, yeah.",
        "No, those are some terrific definitions.",
        "And those first two or three made me think of the - there have been some psychological tests done with couples who have had very long-term marriages.",
        "And interestingly, one of the commonalities amongst those folks were that the spouses were able to overlook their partner's problems, that they had learned how to sort of deal with the background hum of the person they were living with.",
        "So, yeah, I think that's a huge component of this - of wisdom is this idea of knowing that, you know, not only are you yourself riddled with faults, but the other guy is, too, and so you've got to somehow factor that in."

        "And he actually took me dumpster diving and we looked for bananas and leftovers at a local Starbucks.",
        "And yeah, that kind of stuff - it's, you know, it's fascinating to behold, but you've got to understand that when Sandra was growing up, you know, she was a teenage girl and her father was doing this stuff, or her father would, you know, he liked to hitchhike instead of drive.",
        "So, here was this 13-year-old girl who he had stashed behind a bush while he was trying to pick up a ride for the two of them.",
