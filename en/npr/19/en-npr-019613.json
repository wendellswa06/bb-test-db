        "It clicks.",
        "This is what's happening, and we win this one.",
        "Although, I'm a sports fan, too, and, I mean, the polls show Le Pen down maybe 60 percent to 40 percent.",
        "If I'm, you know, playing a game of basketball down by 20 points, even if I'm feeling good about my team, I'm a little worried that the result's not going to go my way.",
        "So are you being realistic?",
        "No, no, I'm being totally realistic for several reasons.",
        "First thing, it's good to be the underdog, you know, because you try harder.",
        "Mikael Sala spoke to us on Skype about the issues driving this election - the economy, immigration, French identity.",
        "He said his far-right candidate would be higher in the polls if more voters would admit that they like her.",
        "Why do you think so many voters don't want to say they're in support of Marine Le Pen?",
        "I mean, are they scared to admit that for some reason?",
        "Exactly.",
        "Because there's been a lot of work from our opponents who sort of portrayed us as the devil itself, which nothing could be remote from - more remote from the truth because we're just patriots.",
        "Like Donald Trump was saying, we want to make America - we want to make France great again.",
        "And to achieve this, we want to make France grow again, instead of, you know, being in misery with 7 million unemployed for a 66 million population.",
        "It's unsustainable.",
        "What do you say to critics of Marine Le Pen and your party who say that there is an anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim sort of message that's been delivered in this campaign?",
        "No, no, it's not an anti-Muslim message, you know?",
        "France is the secular country.",
        "You can, you know, be an addict of whatever religion or denomination you want.",
        "You do it in the - in your home.",
        "In the public space, we're all French, but there's a trend which is a minority of Muslims.",
        "But they are a problem because they are questioning the French way of life.",
        "They are saying that a woman should not walk the streets without, you know, covering her head.",
        "Well, that is not France.",
        "But, Mikael Sala, just help our listeners understand why you and Marine Le Pen do not believe that a Muslim woman should be able to cover in public.",
        "Because, like I said, France is not about religion in public.",
        "The way you practice your religion in France is in your home, in your church, in your mosque or in your synagogue.",
        "But it's not on in public space.",
        "And you know what we got to that point?",
        "Because in its history, France has known very bloody religious conflicts.",
        "We know that when you open the Pandora Box of religious confrontation, there is chaos."

        "Yes.",
        "Memory loss is definitely a problem and don't get me started about my sciatica.",
        "No, it's - the thing about older folks is that I really do think that older folks are like living libraries.",
        "There's an old African saying that goes, the death of an old person is like the burning of a library.",
        "You know, that they are these repositories of knowledge and information and that, as a culture, as we get more and more technologically advanced, we've lost touch with our wise elders.",
        "So, I thought there was really a need to talk to them.",
        "It's interesting you say that.",
        "To some degree, their wisdom is - may be less relevant than it was before because, well, the world is changing quite rapidly.",
        "Well, but they've been through so many of these problems.",
        "I mean, look at the current economic situation.",
        "A lot of these folks have lived through the Depression, so they know what it's like to have to deal with saving and scrimping.",
        "So, no, I think in fact, it's just the opposite.",
        "And the fact that they've, you know, been through - had many more obstacles in their lives and had to overcome many more mishaps is only going to make them better guides for everyone else.",
        "In place of fresher memory, what you suggest old people do have is the ability to recognize patterns very quickly.",
        "That's something that Dr. Goldberg at New York University - that's his bailiwick - is the pattern recognition.",
        "And interestingly, he even ties it to all of the leaders during the 20th century who've had neurological dysfunction, like Reagan's Alzheimer's, et cetera.",
        "And he thinks that people who've - those folks who've been in power have been able to lead because they have seen so many wars, they've seen so many, you know, skirmishes that flare up on borders, and so they know which ones are the ones that need to be paid attention to.",
        "We want to get some listeners into - on the conversation shortly.",
        "We want to know where and to whom you turn for wisdom.",
        "We also have an email challenge going.",
        "The sentence begins, \"\"Wisdom is…\"\" And the email address is talk@npr.org.",
        "But I wanted to ask you - a couple of examples.",
        "You interviewed your second grade teacher from the school you were at in, I guess, Worcester, Massachusetts.",
        "And then you interviewed Phyllis Diller.",
        "And neither one met your expectations.",
        "Well, it wasn't that they met - didn't meet my expectations.",
        "It was simply that I found that in approaching people, there were some folks whose life narratives really needed to be explored at depth, and those two were not necessarily ones.",
        "But you'd expected the school teacher to - her explanation to be sunny, and it was not.",
        "And you'd expected Phyllis Diller to have a, perhaps, darker look at the world, but she was relentlessly upbeat."

        "Exactly.",
        "No, that was the fun part of this whole quest was that there were so many surprises.",
        "My favorite one that I found was the - a fisherman in the Indonesian islands who is a member of the Moken tribe.",
        "And these folks can hold their breath underwater twice as long as most humans.",
        "And he - they learn to swim before they walk.",
        "And he noticed all these forebodings of danger on the morning of the tsunami in 2003.",
        "And he told his tribe to climb a local mountain.",
        "And in so doing, he saved thousands of lives.",
        "Hmm.",
        "He could have had no pattern recognition for that once-in-a-thousand-years tsunami?",
        "Well, right.",
        "Nothing of that caliber, but he had seen the tide go out before storms before and he had - he'd heard, you know, the buzzing of the cicadas dim for smaller storms.",
        "So, no, he'd never seen a tsunami, but he'd seen other really big meteorological catastrophes.",

        "Yeah.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So, you need to know that there's this - that there's always wiggle room.",
        "Nonattachment is this idea that you shouldn't fixate on things.",
        "And reciprocity, of course, is the \"\"do unto others\"\" kind of thinking.",
