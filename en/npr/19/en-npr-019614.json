        "The - wisdom is in short supply.",
        "I think we can all agree with that.",
        "There's a story, Henry Alford, that you tell in your book about buying a dozen assorted bagels, one of them a garlic.",
        "And when you put them all in a paper bag, you realize after you get home and take them out, they are all garlic bagels.",
        "This you define under the category, not so much of wisdom, but as a truism.",
        "How do you tell the difference between a truism and a cliche and real insight?",
        "That's a great question.",
        "And it's a really - it's a tough one to define.",
        "I think in the end, what I'm looking for in wisdom is things that are universal.",
        "And you know, there's this idea that there's practical wisdom and then there's a higher kind of wisdom.",
        "And I think the bag of assorted bagels with one garlic bagel in it - that strikes me maybe more as practical wisdom.",
        "On the other end of the scale?",
        "On the other end of the scale would be something like - well, here's a short - here's a sentence that the prophet Muhammad once wrote.",
        "Trust in God, but tie your camel.",
        "That strikes me as a kind of, you know, an aphorism that you could run your whole life according to that.",
        "You could really, yeah, make that your whole program for life, whereas the thing about the garlic bagel, that'll get you so far.",
        "Get you out of Zabars.",
        "(Laughing ) It'll get you out of the delicatessen, indeed.",
        "You also talked - one of the people you talked with was Harold Bloom at Yale University, of course, the famous teacher there.",
        "And you quote him as saying once famously, \"\"there are no poems, only relations between poems.\"\" And you say, it struck you as slightly crazy until?",

        "And they were all virtually identical.",

        "Forgive me for not following format, but that I've always found that the wisest people usually are those with the least amount of formal education.",
        "They have learned their lessons the hard way, by experiencing them personally and painfully, which leads us to this question by email from David in North Fork, California - what's the difference between being wise and being smart?",
        "Well, being smart is a quantitative kind of intelligence.",
        "That's more about results, whereas wisdom is more about - it's harder to quantify and it's more about being able to understand or perceive universal principles.",
        "And interestingly, that's the big divide in the study of wisdom - is between eastern and western ideas of wisdom, because here, in the West, of course, it's - wisdom is about linear thinking.",

        "And we are basing our decisions - a lot of our thinking about it on short-term economic issues, when what we really needs to be doing is thinking about making changes that won't pay off for 100 or 1000 years."
