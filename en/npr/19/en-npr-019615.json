        "Well, I think it's going to be a fundamental change that has to occur if we're going to be able to get at some of these longer-term issues, because we're just not equipped right now to think that way.",
        "Thanks again.",
        "Happy New Year.",

        "We're talking about wisdom with Henry Alford, the author of \"\"How to Live: A Search for Wisdom from Old People.\"\" You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And I wanted to go through some more of our email challenge responders.",
        "Susan in Patterson, California - wisdom is understanding not only your own limitations, but respecting the limitations of those you love.",
        "This from Al.",
        "Wisdom is knowing that you are not as smart or as wise as you thought you were.",
        "Wisdom is listening, emails Lanie(ph).",
        "And then from, well, Scott in Oregon - wisdom is intelligence moderated by experience.",
        "And Henry Alford, that seems to be - get a lot of things in a small capsule.",
        "Indeed, yeah.",
        "No, those are some terrific definitions.",
        "And those first two or three made me think of the - there have been some psychological tests done with couples who have had very long-term marriages.",
        "And interestingly, one of the commonalities amongst those folks were that the spouses were able to overlook their partner's problems, that they had learned how to sort of deal with the background hum of the person they were living with.",
        "So, yeah, I think that's a huge component of this - of wisdom is this idea of knowing that, you know, not only are you yourself riddled with faults, but the other guy is, too, and so you've got to somehow factor that in.",
        "One of the people you talked to is sort of known to public radio listeners and that is the father of Sandra Tsing Loh, the commentator and - who's appeared many times on This American life and other things.",
        "And she expresses some frustration with this eccentric individual.",

        "It really puzzles my sister and me how he always comes across with this folk hero and we're going, no. He's not that.",
        "He's a total shyster.",
        "(Laughing) Yes.",
        "That's a little powder keg, that relationship.",
        "And I was so flattered that they let me have a peek at it.",
        "Eugene Loh is a retired aerospace engineer who uses a frosted flakes box as his briefcase and who harvests a large percentage of his - the food that he eats daily from dumpsters.",
        "And he actually took me dumpster diving and we looked for bananas and leftovers at a local Starbucks.",
        "And yeah, that kind of stuff - it's, you know, it's fascinating to behold, but you've got to understand that when Sandra was growing up, you know, she was a teenage girl and her father was doing this stuff, or her father would, you know, he liked to hitchhike instead of drive.",
        "So, here was this 13-year-old girl who he had stashed behind a bush while he was trying to pick up a ride for the two of them.",
        "And I could see how it would be just totally mortifying for her."

        "This was going to happen in the fall of 2006.",
        "We do know that the plot didn't get much further than sort of agreement in chat rooms - so there wasn't explosives, they hadn't done the reconnaissance - it was just enough for the government to say this is a serious threat because these guys have, have made an agreement.",
        "The Miami plot we know a little bit more about.",
        "Seven men were plotting to blow up targets, including the Sears Tower in Chicago.",
        "Even the FBI acknowledged this plot was quote, more aspirational than operational.",

        "That's exactly right, Alex.",
        "I mean a lot of those 9-11 plotters who ended up flying airplanes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, weren't much farther along in their plots than these guys.",
        "You go from sort of being a sleeper cell to operational within a nanosecond.",
        "And so what the government says is, there's no line at which you can sort of say, okay now they're officially dangerous, this is officially a real plot - we have to get them the minute we hear about this because the alternative is to wait too long.",
