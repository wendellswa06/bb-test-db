        "Did it mean being more earnest?",
        "Yeah, that certainly is an aspect to it.",
        "Every song is a pretty clear, I would say, like, narrative.",
        "For me, that was sort of the thing that I had not done, the sort of slit the wrists and bleed out kind of songs I had not done.",
        "And so mine has been a journey from being very much in my head to slowly moving down further and further and further.",
        "And I would say that the nexus of power from this record is like the gut, rather than the throat or the head."
