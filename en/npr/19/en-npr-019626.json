        "If that was meant as bait to get Gorsuch to react, he apparently didn't take the bait.",
        "Senator Richard Durbin asked the nominee about letters from two of his former students who allege that Gorsuch had asked for a show of hands in class as to who knew of women who had manipulated their law firms by failing to disclose their plans to have a family, then using their maternity benefits once hired and then leaving the firm.",
        "Gorsuch responded vehemently that he had done no such thing, that in fact he always asked for a show of hands to see if law firm applicants generally were being asked at job interviews about their plans to have a family.",

        "Whitehouse rejected that notion, angrily noting that it was the Supreme Court which, as he put it, had dramatically changed the political ecosystem."
