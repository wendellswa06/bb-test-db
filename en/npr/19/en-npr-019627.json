        "I think that's right.",
        "Particularly with series, you not only are getting to know the character's journey, but you know that it continues even beyond that last page.",
        "So you're not really cheating when you look at the last page because it's only the last page of that particular entry.",
        "I guess with the \"\"Harry Potter\"\" book, I'd say that's a separate phenomenon because I think even people who are not typical peekers might peek at this one because they want to have some control over finding that out, right, the big question of what happens to Harry, because I'm also going to try to lock myself in a room.",
        "But I'm doing a lot of travel these days and I'm scared to death I'm going to overhear it in an airport or on radio by somebody who doesn't have their finger on the dump button.",
        "And so…",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "…I might be tempted to peek because at least for that moment, I control whether I know or not.",
        "Right, and save yourself the heartbreak if something really tragic happens."

        "For the raw plot, I do.",
        "I know who did it and why and how the pieces are going to come together from an investigative standpoint.",

        "But, you know, in terms of the things other than raw plotting, I don't always know how things are going to end.",
        "In my current book, \"\"Dead Connection,\"\" it was meant to be a stand-alone book where we would never see Ellie Hatcher again who's a detective in New York.",
        "And when I got to the end of the book with the raw plot, I realized that her personal journey really wasn't done yet and that it worked better as one of those series books that we were talking about where you get a temporary closure to that passage of their life that there's really more to be told about the person.",
        "So that really kind of caught me by surprise.",
