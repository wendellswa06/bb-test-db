        "Well, he, you know, a couple weeks ago, drew a crowd of nearly 2,500 in Council Bluffs.",

        "So they really like what Bernie talks about, and they feel that he's maybe more or less beholden to special interests than Hillary might be.",

        "I think where we have seen people really attach to him is they believe that he'll follow through.",
        "So when he took on unions and did what he did in Wisconsin, Iowans really like that.",
        "But where we might see issues - can he appeal to both the moderate right wing of the party and maybe the more conservative party, and will he be able to keep both sides happy for long enough to win the caucuses?",
        "Scott Walker is doing very well in the polls, though, in Iowa.",

        "Walker's not been here much through the spring, so what I'll be looking for is, once he announces, how does he actually campaign here in New Hampshire, what kind of an organization does he put together, and just how he actually engages as a candidate with New Hampshire voters.",
        "Does it diminish the importance of the New Hampshire primary or the Iowa caucuses on the Republican side if there are a dozen or more candidates and if the winner does come in with 16 percent of the vote?",
        "Does that, Annah, make the Iowa caucuses less of a prize if it's such a small margin of victory?",
        "We've always said that there's three tickets out of Iowa, and maybe this year, it's four or five, but I don't think it does necessarily diminish the value there.",
        "But as you say, people in Iowa talk about there being three tickets out of Iowa, meaning that the field gets winnowed down there.",
        "If there are five people coming out of Iowa, that really does limit that winnowing function.",
        "Yeah, I mean, I guess with a bigger field, you're not winnowing, you know, six down to three, but no one thinks that the Iowa caucus is sort of the end-all, be-all predictor of who's going to be the party nominee.",
        "Whereas everyone in New Hampshire thinks that is the be-all and end-all...",
        "Right."
