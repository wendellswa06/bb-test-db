        "It's not at all that.",
        "The question is, in pursuing this, are we going to criminalize best practices that journalists use - such as using encryption, such as source protection, such as asking a source for information?",
        "OK.",
        "Mr. McLaughlin, what about you?",
        "You say - you've written about this as well, and you said that you don't consider Assange's activity journalism for a number of reasons.",
        "You say his main target is the United States, not corruption more broadly.",
        "Others have written about the fact that he had ample opportunity to publish information about Russia's activities in Ukraine, for example, and didn't do so.",
        "So what do you say about all this?",
        "Well, that's the main point, Michel.",
        "The fact that - I don't see him as a legitimate journalist because a couple of reasons.",
        "First, it isn't just that he published material that people don't want to see published.",
        "That's not really the issue.",
        "If he actually conspired to help break into a Pentagon computer, that's not something a legitimate journalist does.",
        "Also, when he gave this material to mainstream journalists, my understanding from what I've heard said by people who worked with him is that many people wanted to take out material that would have endangered the lives of Afghans and Iraqis who had given information to the United States about al-Qaida, for example.",
        "And he didn't want to do that, whereas a legitimate journalist will at least listen to that case.",
        "And that's basically my objection to him.",
        "I don't see him as a legitimate journalist at all.",
        "And what about Margaret's point, though, that by - that arresting him and prosecuting him will have a chilling effect on legitimate journalists who do protect sources and who sometimes do come into possession of materials that governments would not want them to have?",
        "What would you say about that?",
        "Well, I don't think journalists should be prosecuted or arrested for those practices, which are all legitimate, freedom of speech practice that we all support.",
        "That's not why he will be accused, I think.",
        "He not only apparently - we have to find out, give him a fair trial if it gets a trial - might have broken into, helped break into a Pentagon computer.",
        "But also, if you look at Robert Mueller's indictments of the 12 Russian GRU officers who were instrumental in interfering in our election, it's quite clear from that and also from what the intelligence community published and declassified in January of 2017 that that dump of documents went to WikiLeaks and - via a couple of online personages that the Russians invented - Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks."

        "So again, I don't know whether that's going to turn out to be something on which he can be legitimately indicted.",

        "Well, I think that Mr. McLaughlin is 100 percent right about that.",
        "There was a time earlier on - you know, it's getting to be 10 years ago - when Julian Assange did more of that kind of thing - redacting things that could be problematic or harmful, even, I think, consulting or allowing the information to be worked over by government sources or seen by government sources.",
        "But I think those issues are - they don't go to the heart of my concern.",

        "government could and should charge him for publishing these secrets?",
