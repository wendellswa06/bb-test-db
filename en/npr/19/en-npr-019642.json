        "The answer was Once in a Blue Moon, which we'll have to explain some other time.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "The last time, the time from when we saw white smoke and the bells in 2005, when Joseph Ratzinger was elected and became Benedict XVI, it took 45 minutes from the smoke to when he appeared on the loggia, and that is the protodeacon, as he's called.",
        "This time it'll be Cardinal Tauran who will announce in Latin, quite milking the Latin for everything it possibly can.",

        "The pre-conclave period looked like there were huge divisions between the so-called insiders, the Vatican administration, the Curia and the so-called reformers from outside of the Vatican.",
        "But it seems that probably the fact that they did this quite fast, in five ballots, it means they probably wanted to give a sign of unity in the church at a time when it is being buffeted by so many crises all over the world.",
        "And so, many crises around the world.",
        "Those of us outside the church tend to think of those crises as the - well, the scandals about, you know, cover-ups of priests who attacked children and the problems with not enough priests and the dwindling membership in many parts of the world.",
        "It's not always clear that the Catholic cardinals see the same problems the same way.",
        "No, absolutely.",
        "I think the whole issue of the clerical sex abuse, which started in the - that is the revelations started in the United States and then exploded about two or three years ago across Europe, in Germany and Ireland, it's come to roost here.",
        "But I still think there is still an unawareness.",
        "I don't know if it's an unwillingness to really tackle this problem within here at the seat of the Vatican Church.",
        "Yes, Benedict did many things, but I don't think many people inside the curia have really have grasped how serious the problem is.",
        "And at the same time last year, they were really buffeted by this whole VatiLeaks scandal that revealed an incredible degree of corruption and infighting, intrigue.",
        "And also what's not been talked about so much are the finances, the very murky finances of the Vatican, the issues concerning the Vatican Bank, which has been under investigation by Italian authorities for suspected money laundering and all sorts of other strange things."

        "So there are a lot of, a lot of problem afflicting the Catholic Church right now.",
        "And reform of the Curia, this is essentially the bureaucracy, the engines of administration of Catholic Church, reform of the Curia is going to be very high on the new pope's agenda.",
        "It's going to be very high, and it's going to be a huge task because it has gained an enormous power, both first under the long papacy, 27 years of John Paul II and who basically let others take care of it.",
        "He had other priorities.",
        "His was - he was an evangelizer, he wanted to bring the message of the church to the rest of - to the world.",
        "He had a really geopolitical, also, vision of the church.",
        "And meantime, the administration, he let things go, and it became an incredibly powerful and ingrained administration.",
        "Benedict was unable, he even admitted, I think, and unable to really tackle the problem.",
        "So it's going to be a very, very big problem, and the question we'll see now, who have they chosen.",
        "Have they chosen an insider, who knows, as they say, where the bodies are buried but who knows what the - how to tackle those problems?",
        "Or have they chosen an outside who may not know exactly how the whole Curia is structured.",
        "This is what we're waiting to hear, I hope in not too many minutes more.",

        "Will it be a theologian, a student like Benedict, or will it be somebody more outgoing with a lot more charisma, like John Paul II, his predecessor.",

        "First, he has to accept, and that's one thing, and then once he's accepted, he goes into a little room that's right next to the Sistine Chapel, and it's called the Room of Tears.",
        "Mainly it's been given that name because that's where the emotion will probably come out, the whole experience of having been selected pope.",
        "And there he will find three different sizes of papal vestments, small, medium and large depending on his size.",
        "I think there are several, several possibilities of shoes.",
        "There's a wider variety of shoe sizes.",
        "He will be dressed in the papal vestments, and then he will move from the Sistine Chapel to the Pauline Chapel.",
        "There he will stop and pray for a few minutes in silence, alone, and then the protodeacon, who is Cardinal Tauran, will be the first to appear on the loggia and will make the announcement, and then the new pope will follow, and he will say something.",
        "He will announce also the name that he has taken, and usually the pope explains why he's chosen that name.",
        "And we'll learn that all in very short time.",
        "And we'll be deconstructing all of these events as they happen.",

        "In some way, the idea that, you know, it isn't necessarily tenure for life, and that may have sort of also diminished a little bit what was considered the semi-divine nature of the papacy.",
        "But it could possibility bring that position, that figure a little bit down a lot.",
        "It really depends on who we're going to see now - a manager, a theologian, an evangelizer, you know, all in one, who knows?",
        "The - there was not an enormous excitement, as we all have said many times, of a frontrunner.",

        "But 1.2 billion Catholics around the world are awaiting their new leader, the identity of the new leader and the new direction that new leader may take.",
        "And, of course, that includes, what, I think about a quarter of all Americans identify themselves as Catholic these days, and no small significance there too.",
        "And as Sylvia was just mentioning - NPR's Sylvia Poggioli with us in Rome - this is an enormous institution that is broken up, of course, into various dioceses and archdioceses.",
        "But nevertheless, central direction comes from the Vatican, from the pope himself.",
        "And this is an institution unlike any other in the world.",
        "Yes, an ancient institution, but as we've also been talking about, one that is adapting to changes, including the decision by Pope Benedict XVI, Joseph Ratzinger, the former Joseph Ratzinger, to retire rather than to serve out until his death, which had been the tradition for more than 600 years, and as Sylvia Poggioli was just speculating, well, maybe has opened up a new direction in the idea of how long the pope's reign may be.",
