        "And as I say, it's - you can see people holding up mobile phones and cameras because, of course, this is a moment for them, particularly for the Catholics among them, which I will assume are the majority, is a moment of great history, and they want to record that.",
        "And they're flourishing flags.",
        "I could see the flag of the Vatican there being waved in front of the Basilica of St. Peter's.",

        "Women had a rather substantial leadership role in the Catholic Church than after Constantine made Christianity the state religion and the church - worship moved into the open basilicas where women were pushed aside in public spaces.",
