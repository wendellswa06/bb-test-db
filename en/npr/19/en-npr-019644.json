        "In the meantime, we're going to hear a little bit of the sound as people gathered, a massive throng there in St. Peter's Basilica - outside St. Peter's Basilica.",

        "Hello.",
        "And what does this moment mean to Catholics?",
        "Well, I just find it extremely ironic that we have all heard a million times that the church is not a democracy, and yet the whole world is now watching as to what will be the outcome of a vote.",
        "Now, certainly the College of Cardinals isn't the most representative body, but - and you might make a few quips at this point about the U.S.",
        "Senate also, but nonetheless it is amazing that we're waiting to see the outcome of a whole extended process of deliberation, discussion and finally balloting.",
        "And this an extraordinary moment because of the resignation of the previous pope.",
        "That's right, so right away we're setting new kinds of precedents, and we'll see whether that trend will continue.",
        "The American Catholics, if not their leaders, but Catholics have been regarded as sort of, well, wandering a bit from the flock, at least from Rome's point of view.",

        "So - and that's a wider pattern.",
        "The church is growing in Africa, it's growing in other parts of the world, but all of them are facing their own particular issues, and that's one of the questions, I think, before us.",
        "What can one leader do for a 1.2 billion member church that exists in so many different cultures, different regions, under different kinds of political arrangements and so on?",
        "And one thing that American Catholics do want is a pope who will address perhaps more directly even than the previous pope the sexual scandal of abuse and cover-up.",
        "I think that's true, although I myself would argue that an awful lot of that does - it does relate to what the local churches do, that is the bishops, the conferences of bishops in regions; it does have a lot to do with one important papal power, which is the selection of bishops to begin with.",
        "But I don't think the pope, any pope, is going to kind of act as the final investigator and enforcer of what probably has to be done nation by nation, country by country, maybe even dioceses and archdioceses by archdioceses.",
        "And that - we keep hearing about the unified hierarchy of the church, but when you hear, for example, just I guess yesterday, the Diocese of Los Angeles coming to a $10 million settlement with some new lawsuits, this is done very locally.",
        "It is done locally, but, you know, there are these larger issues that transcend the local cases.",
        "One I just mentioned is the selection of bishops.",
        "Another one is the overall issue of the role of women, women in the church, women in society.",
        "This is something which in different ways is occurring throughout the world on every continent.",
        "So that's not just a North American or European issue.",
        "It's a worldwide issue, and that's one where the leadership of the pope could be very important, although again, it's going to have to be implemented whatever direction the church takes will be implemented locally.",
        "And there are of course numbers of American nuns and nuns elsewhere in the world who feel that they are being - well, getting ready for a purge almost.",
        "Yeah, I think this has been one of the - certainly for the United States, I don't think other nations are as sensitive to this particular, these recent actions that seem to be directed particularly at the orders of women religious in the United States.",
        "Now, that - the fact that Vatican offices took that up and took that up in the way they took that up is an example of the kind of thing that a pope might deal with in terms of what's been much discussed, the reform of the Vatican offices or the curia.",
        "Well, it looks like we have movement there in St. Peter's Square on the balcony.",
        "So Peter Steinfels, thank you very much for your time today."
