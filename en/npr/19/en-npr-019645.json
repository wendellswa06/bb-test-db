        "If there was, it certainly hasn't been in modern history.",
        "So - and now we're waiting to hear, to see him and hear him.",
        "And this is really very surprising.",
        "There are men in business suits clearing the way and getting the logistical operations ready, setting up microphones and whatnot, scurrying around there on the balcony and getting ready for this - well, it's got to be an enormous moment in this man's life as he accepts, well, one of the most revered offices on the planet.",
        "What we can say - you asked me about the name.",
        "Certainly you know St. Francis is - if it's related to St. Francis, the name certainly - the connection is poverty and humility.",
        "And so that already is a sign of, you know, the image he wants to give of himself.",
        "So he was the runner-up in the last conclave, and he's said - he's an accomplished intellectual.",
        "He studied theology in Germany.",
        "We're going to have another theologian here.",
        "And he's also known for personal simplicity and - but believe me, this is - he was just nowhere on the list of the first 10 or 15 names that we were hearing in the last few days.",
        "The great red curtain on the balcony has now been closed, so we will not see any more men in suits scurrying around and presumably so it can be opened to great dramatic effect in just a moment when the new pope emerges.",
        "Franciscus will we call him from now on, and he will address the crowd there in Vatican City in Rome and around the world via television and radio.",
        "And Sylvia Poggioli, do we know - well, he finished second last time.",
        "How do we know that?",
        "Aren't those...",
        "You're right.",
        "There have been some anonymous leaks after that conclave.",
        "There was a cardinal who apparently wrote a diary, which was distributed or published by an Italian journalist, I believe, and he dropped all those - that information there and that Bergoglio had actually finished behind - we were surprised because we had thought the main rival to Ratzinger in that conclave was the Italian, the Milan Archbishop Carlo Maria Martini, who was sort of the favorite of the liberals, of the progressives.",
        "But now it turns out that it was Bergoglio.",
        "He is 76 years old.",
        "His father was an Italian immigrant from the region around Turin, and he is a Jesuit.",
        "He entered the Society of Jesus and studied for the priesthood, and we'll know more...",
        "We'll know more shortly.",

        "And so this is really - this is a historical day.",

        "We're hearing cheers there from St. Peter's Square as we get ready to greet the new pope in Rome on a cold night where there's been a lot of rain, of course the square lit up with tremendous lights.",
