        "Sylvia, you were saying?",
        "I think he - he also - the image he gives - he gave in the few minutes there were one of great humility, simple words, very direct, talking to the people.",
        "This - I remember, in some ways, Karol Wojtyla, who then became John Paul II, had this very simple, direct way of talking, very charming way of talking directly to the Romans, because you forget - don't forget, one of the titles of the pontiff is bishop of Rome.",
        "And also, he reminds me a lot of the pope who lasted only 30 days, John Paul I, Don Albino Luciani, who also had a really, very good, popular touch with the people.",
        "We'll have to see.",
        "But the first step - the impact is certainly one of not of a Vatican insider.",
        "That's for sure.",

        "I don't know how to say it.",
        "He has - there's something fresh about him.",
        "Let's hope it comes out that way.",
        "The election of a 76-year-old man to the office of pope may cause some to think that he's being selected as a placeholder, a sort of compromise candidate until, obviously, somebody new is picked very soon, relatively soon.",
        "Of course, I think the last time that happened, John XXIII was quite an elderly man when he was elected, and it was a long time he was in office, and made a lot of changes.",
        "Absolutely, absolutely.",
        "He looked pretty good, though.",
        "He may be 76, but he looked pretty good.",
        "He's tall.",
        "He's erect.",
        "I've seen - yesterday, when we saw a lot of the - all the cardinals, the under-80 cardinals in procession, going into the Sistine Chapel.",
        "There were several who really didn't look like they could - they would have been able to handle this task.",
        "So he - we'll see.",
        "He looks pretty good.",
        "He certainly looks - he's two years younger than what Ratzinger was when he became pope.",
        "But he looks, to me, in - he looks stronger than Ratzinger did then.",
        "And he's - he is said to specialize in pastoral work.",
        "What do we take from that?",
        "Well, that's something that, you know, the cardinals were looking for.",
        "They were looking for what they call, you know, an evangelizer, somebody who takes the message out, who's had an experience as a pastor in diocese.",
        "That also brings with it, you know, a certain amount of management abilities, which Ratzinger did not have - which Pope Benedict XVI did not have, and - nor did John Paul II.",
        "So this is - he certainly brings some of the key abilities that many of the cardinals from outside of Rome were looking for in their selection.",

        "It's a real important shock.",
        "Many of us in Latin America have had, for years, of course, the hope that a Latin American would become a pope.",
        "We also know that that doesn't guarantee absolutely anything, because there are as many or more conservative bishops, archbishops and cardinals among our clergy as you can find anywhere else.",
        "However, it's still a big surprise to have a Latin American archbishop being elected as pope.",
        "And what do you know of his history?",
        "Well, I know that he was the provincial of the Jesuit Order in Argentina from, I think, 1973 to 1979.",
        "He was archbishop of Buenos Aires from 1998 until now.",
        "He was made a cardinal in 2001, and he has been, all through, a very staunch conservative in the church.",
        "He has - he stood basically by the right-wing military dictatorships in the '70s when he was the provincial of the Jesuits, and he had pretty conservative positions throughout his tenure until now as archbishop of Argentina, of Buenos Aires.",
        "You said that he stood - the church stood by the generals who ran Argentina for a while and, of course, that involved the Dirty War, as well.",
        "Was the church, in any way, implicated in any of those crimes?",
        "Yes.",
        "Unfortunately, that's a standing accusation against the leadership of the church in Argentina, that so many of the bishops were directly or indirect accomplices of the Dirty War in Argentina, and there are several investigations going on, including those moved by relatives of the disappeared during the Dirty War - many of whom are, of course, themselves, Roman Catholic activists."

        "But is there a history to suggest - as some say it happens sometimes with Supreme Court appointees - that once in office in this lifetime appointment, that their views shift or mature?",

        "Well - and plus, the symbolism of having an Argentine pope, you know, making such a huge statement, because he is from the developing world, from the Third World, I guess one would expect, one would hope, that he takes that as one of his missions, to represent also the rest of the Southern Hemisphere, you know, to travel to African and to Asia and throughout Latin America, that, you know, he really is a bridge to these surging populations of Catholics in the rest of the world.",

        "Well, Neal, many, many people that I've spoken to all over the continent had hoped for an African pope, but they'll be pleased that the new pope comes from Latin America, comes from the developing world, and especially has lived among the poor and knows the priorities of the poor and the developing world.",
        "The few people I have spoken to on the way to the cathedral here have said this is very good news.",
        "It's been, what, about 1,000 years since - that the Catholic Church has had a European as its head.",

        "I think his simplicity, his quietness, his apparent humility is going to go down very well in Africa.",
        "The pomp and ceremony at the Vatican are all well and good, but they do want a pope who knows how they feel, who will be able to understand what they feel their pressures, daily pressures and others are, and one who will keep coming to Africa to talk to them.",
