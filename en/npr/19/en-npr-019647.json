        "So whoever comes next must listen to the African voice.",
        "So a pope who will be talking to Africa, but also listening to Africa, I think is hugely important to the Catholic congregation on this continent.",
        "And have you had a chance to gather any reaction just in a few minutes since that we found out who the new pope is?",
        "(unintelligible) with huge joy, generally because there is a pope, and that a pope was elected so quickly.",
        "A lot of people say this is a tough job, tough, tough, tough job trying to lead the Catholic Church with all its challenges in Africa, outside of Africa.",
        "So they wish him well.",
        "They bless him, and they welcome him into the community.",
        "That was a very moving moment you spoke of when he asked the crowd there, as the bishop of Rome, to pray for him, and the entire vast multitude went silent as he bent over in prayer and prayed with him, and then came back, of course, with the traditional prayers, the Our Father.",
        "And I'm sure you'll find, Neal, that that wasn't just in St. Peter's Square, but repeated all over the world where Catholics were congregating to watch the announcement and find out who their new pope would be.",
        "I'm sure many, many Catholics here in Africa were also holding their breaths and praying, praying for their church and for their new pope.",
        "Ofeibea Quist-Arcton, NPR's correspondent with us from Dakar, in Senegal.",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "Always a pleasure.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.",
        "Religion correspondent, John Burnett, still with us here in Studio 3A.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I just wanted to follow up on what Ofeibea had said.",
        "One of the first things that the new pope said was that you have found one at the end of the world - self-identifying as an outsider, as someone who comes from a continent very distance from the origins of the church and from the traditional power centers.",
        "And so it's going to be so interesting to see if he continues this theme of really representing those in the church who, you know, who have not been close to the United States and Rome.",
        "And it's interesting, of course, it's unusual to hear jokes in Latin."

        "There are those of us who have forgotten our high school learning.",
        "Yes.",
        "It is not something that is regarded as a dead language there in the Vatican, and it is going to be - first impressions matter.",
        "And I think we've tried to read a lot into a brief statement and a brief appearance by the pope, and the little we know and the more that we're learning about his training and his background and what his politics are and what he stands for.",
        "But this is going to be - every step he takes for the next few weeks is going to be very vividly recorded in the imagination, not just in Catholics, but there are others who have great interest in his leadership.",
        "He also spoke very good Italian.",
        "So that clearly was a priority.",
        "Well, Italian - he is from Italian heritage, we're told.",
        "With the name of Bergoglio, I guess that makes sense.",
        "There are, of course, large numbers of Italian immigrants who moved to Argentina.",
        "And from the background there and we'll have to find out more about his background in terms of what he did during the reign of the generals there in Argentina, which was a dark period in that country's history.",
        "But there is got to be a celebration.",
        "South America, John, as you well know, a place that is dynamic at this moment, the great burgeoning economy of Brazil.",
        "Argentina, not doing so well at the moment, but Brazil is doing very well, indeed.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's also a place where there's a tremendous spiritual war going on for the souls of the faithful.",
        "The evangelical and the Pentecostal churches are making huge in-roads.",
        "They are siphoning off lots of Catholics very aggressively with huge, huge congregations.",
        "This is happening in, certainly, in Brazil, but really throughout the continent, also.",
        "So, you know, whether he can stem that flow, he can stop the leak of, you know, so many of Catholics to other faiths is going to be one of his challenges.",
        "Interesting that the previous pope seemed to be concerned with the growing secularization - that, of course, a European concern and an American concern - as congregations dwindle in those parts of the Catholic world.",
        "It is a battle, as you say, in South America, Ofeibea Quist-Arcton telling us that the church is going fastest in Africa.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it really - and South Americans also identifying in a way that Americans are in the non category, more and more South Americas - and particularly in modernizing countries like Brazil and Argentina - that are saying, well, we don't have a religious affiliation now.",
        "We're floating in the culture.",
        "So how do you grab them?",
        "NPR religion correspondent John Burnett, we'll hope to hear more from you on this as day's going on.",

        "Her book, \"\"Black, White, Other\"\" was published in 1994, a time when multi-racial identity was entering the public debate.",

        "Well I think the start of a real public biracial identity came with the baby boom.",
        "That was the first generation to profit in terms of attitudes and experiences from the burgeoning civil rights movement, from the increasingly legal recognition of their parent's unions as states overturned the anti-msyogination laws.",
        "And then also, from other factors such as World War II vets coming home having seen a different way in which they could be received by the world."

        "Now, of course people who are multiracial can be many different combinations, but your book, \"\"Black, White, Other\"\" really was a landmark book and it collected the stories of 46 adult children of black-white unions.",
        "And there was a cultural moment where people were really - people who may not have been personally invested through their family histories were really looking at this issue as well as people who did have mixed-race families that they came from.",
        "So what did you find in your research?",
        "Well, I found that starting with the 1980s, there was the first biracial presence acknowledged mixed-race backgrounds in the marketplace and in various forms of culture.",
        "You know, maybe nothing did more for public sense that there are mixed-race people out there than \"\"A Different World,\"\" the spin-from \"\"The Cosby Show\"\" that ran from '87 to '93.",

        "Those were all people who were - might have chosen to identify as black, but were not hiding the fact or ashamed of the fact that they had parents from the two different backgrounds.",
        "Is there - I remember when I was in college, and that was now 20 years ago, that there was a lot of discussion on campus about this, and there were some tough moments.",
        "What - is it an easier time now for people to say, I'm biracial, without people perceiving it as them saying, I'm not black?",
        "Which as been an issue that comes up again and again.",
        "Do you think that's even - do you think that's a fair debate to have, whether some people are conflicted about race as well as, you know, trying to run away from something rather than trying to embrace something?",
        "Sure.",
        "Sure.",
        "Well I think a lot of the conflict over - between people who identified as mixed-race, black-white biracial, and black, was that there was a perception that the mixed-race people were trying to define themselves as the colored caste of South Africa, something slightly better and above, who may be closer to white as if that were a positive value.",
        "And that was not well received by many people in the black community.",
        "I think what started to shift was that it has become, as I think President-elect Obama demonstrates, this can be an identity that is fluid, that is not denigrating any particular aspect of it, that is proud of all components of its heritage and that has so much fluidity that Obama, for example, can identify as a black man and as a bi-racial person without canceling each other out.",

        "And that my grandfather, in fact, was with me, who had been registering voters in 1946 in rural Georgia, which was perilous thing to do - black voters.",
        "And so I think my dad would have been excited and gratified about this new direction.",
        "But I also think that he would be glad to see discussions of race elevated as he would say from just an emotional level to a more pragmatic level.",
