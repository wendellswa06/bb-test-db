        "Yes.",
        "...How many marathons have you run in your life?",

        "(Laughter) You just came right with that.",
        "I never thought I would ever run a marathon even when I was a younger man and running for exercise.",

        "What was unusual and unexpected in my case is that when I finished the marathon, instead of saying, OK, that's done, now I shall buy a sports car or go trekking in Nepal, I said, I wonder if I can do that faster.",
        "There are a couple things you point out about running in this book that I had never thought of before.",

        "Yeah, it's a little weird.",
        "I technically have raced Meb Keflezighi, the finest American runner of our generation, twice.",
        "And yet at the same time, those of us who do run really don't pay a lot of attention to the people who are best at it.",
        "And that is I think because this is something that we do by ourselves and for ourselves.",
        "And what people are looking for out of running is much more complex than merely a winning time.",
        "You write, to simply run makes excellent sense.",
        "To run a marathon is to go beyond sense.",

        "And I said, I think that's kind of the point.",
        "And certainly there was a time when, like a lot of people, I thought that suffering was the point because our lives are pretty comfortable compared to, well, to any other time in human history.",
        "We don't even have to walk anyplace if we don't want to.",
        "So I think that for a lot of people, to actually do something difficult, to physically suffer is in a weird way to feel alive, to rise to some challenge that you might feel is missing.",
        "But I have actually I think grown away from that perspective that suffering is the point.",
        "Running long distances is not an opportunity to see how much you can suffer but to see how much you can prepare, to see how much you can apply discipline and practice and mindset.",
        "I've come to think of it as a much more meditative endeavor with the rewards of meditation, of mindfulness, of being in the moment you're in rather than gritting your teeth and seeing how long you can stand it."
