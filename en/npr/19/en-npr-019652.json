        "It's obviously a wonderful thing.",
        "But one thing that does come to mind is that I think it was about ten years ago that Oprah had a project where, if I'm not mistaken, she was giving $30,000, which was a little more money then, to seven inner city families, and the idea was to lift them out of poverty with counseling, et cetera, from a certain conglomeration of centers.",
        "And the fact of the matter is that, for one thing, there was a certain amount of screening for the better candidates, like, for example, the ones who, with all acknowledgement to what Jeff said, the ones who did not have any drug problems and some other things.",
        "And the fact of the matter is that nothing remotely significant came out of that experiment.",
        "So all that is to say is at the first part of the story is that Oprah starting it.",
        "And I think it's a beautiful thing, even if it's one thing, even if it's somewhat elite.",
        "But we must get over that American media short-term memory problem.",
        "And we have to go back in four years and just see whether or not it's worked.",
        "And if it has, hooray.",
        "And if it hasn't, figure why it hasn't and then seek other strategies.",
        "So I just hope that we look at it later as well as now.",
        "Jeff, South Africa is a country that I personally love and I've visited several times, and I'm going to go back again soon.",
        "And in some ways, there is a lot of connection between the challenges that South African youth face and the challenges that African-American youth face.",
        "There is a distinction or a conversation going on I think within the black community over issues like vouchers.",
        "You know, do you save your kids from the public school system or do you rely on changing that system from within.",
        "What do you think that Oprah's school will do to a conversation perhaps on a global level about - can you pick out a few of the best students and lift them up, or do you really need to change the system wholesale?",
        "Well, here post-Kwanzaa I think it's speaks to the nature of, agree with it or not, what is called kujichagulia - self-determination - the ability to grab the reins and take control.",
        "There are some people who would be critics of this and say, hey $40 million in South Africa, you could have given me one or two million and I could have opened a school for impoverished kids in Anytown, U.S.A.",
        "But the fact remains that it was probably easier for her to do and to be more self-determining in South Africa at this time."

        "If Oprah's heart is lying in South Africa right now, then bless her for stepping up to the plate where her heart is and putting her money where her mouth is.",

        "But, you know, the other thing is that…",
        "…this is the step in the right direction.",
        "The other thing, Jeff, is that she's raising the profile of females.",
        "And that's the big issue globally, that young girls and young women are denigrated and they have no value.",
        "So if she can uplift the role of women in the world, then that is a positive thing.",
