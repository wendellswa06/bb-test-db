        "Hello.",

        "You're white.",
        "How did you come to this story?",
        "Well, I stumbled on this story.",
        "I was doing a TV pilot, and the host was an African-American woman who just told me simply how much more African-American women spent on their hair than white women.",
        "And I thought that would make kind of an interesting, funny little short.",
        "And then I started filming, and people started telling me about this Korean lockdown on the black hair industry.",
        "And it inspired me, with my own money, to fly around the country and travel to these African-American neighborhoods and see for myself what the true story was.",
        "And there, and behold, I found that 99 percent of the customers for black hair products were, in fact, black.",
        "But 99 percent of the owners were Korean.",
        "And it made me just reflect on kind of like economic social justice.",
        "And I decided to follow the film and the story.",
        "Ninety-nine percent.",
        "We just heard a figure of 80 percent.",
        "How do you calculate these overall figures?",
        "Well, you know, these are empirical.",
        "But it's - there are very few black-owned stores.",
        "And you know, to me this is just a wake-up call that something needs to be done to encourage black entrepreneurship and black ownership in these disenfranchised neighborhoods.",
        "And I'm just amazed, to be honest, that, you know, that African-Americans other than, let's say, Magic Johnson haven't entered these small neighborhoods and started opening up retail shops to sell these products."

        "Ayena, do you think, first of all, that really the market is as dominated by people of one ethnicity or one nationality, as Aron has found in his documentary, and if so, why?",
        "I do think that it's probably closer to the 80 percent number.",
        "I know when we were doing research for the book, which ended in 2000, we interviewed the president of AHBAI, which is an African-American watchdog group about the black hair care industry.",
        "And they estimated that, in 2000, that Koreans and Korean-Americans dominated about 60 percent of the black hair care market.",
        "But they said that that number was growing in a crazy way.",
        "So it's not surprising to me that in Aron's documentary, he said it's about 80 percent now.",
        "One of the reasons is because I think there was just a lack of vigilance by African-Americans that this really could be a problem.",
        "A lot of times, the focus on quote-unquote saving the black hair care market was looking at white-owned companies buying the companies that made the products, not really at looking who is distributing the products and opening the stores.",
        "John, I want you to listen to something from Aron's documentary.",
        "Okay.",

        "As they brought their own products in, they start to manufacture curling irons, and then they start to slowly cut back on orders, and then they tell you that your product is not in demand.",
        "Now, what I want to pursue with you, John - you are an entrepreneur.",
        "You own three stores.",
        "That's pretty much the American dream.",
        "It's just like to go out there and have your own business.",
        "Is this is a case of people just pursuing their dreams in the Korean-American community?",
        "Or is this a case, as the last clip from the film indicates, of people kind of being shut out?",
        "I don't see anybody being shutout.",
        "As far as Kozuri is concerned, yes, they have a good product, an excellent product.",
        "And they cost a bit more than some of the products that have been coming out, say, made in China over the last couple of years.",
        "But it's up to the customer whether or not they buy the particular product, okay."

        "I had a very interesting experience.",
        "I was in Atlanta about three weeks ago, and I was at one of the few black-owned beauty supply stores.",
        "And he had received a letter from the Atlanta Beauty Supply Association and it was about a hair show that was happening in the Atlanta area.",

        "First they took over the retail, then the wholesale.",
        "And now they are grabbing some of the actual manufacturers.",
        "So what they are able to do is completely lock in the industry.",
        "And again, one of the ways they control it is by limiting the English language use among them.",

        "I don't even read Beauty Times, just simply because it's in Korean.",
        "There are a lot of Korean-owned beauty supply OTC stores in America, okay?",
        "So (unintelligible) a lot of them don't speak English very well, and they are producing and publishing these magazines.",

        "So Ayena, what's all that about?",
        "Well, some of it is just economics.",
        "People think, okay, well, this is the cheapest product.",
        "This is what I'm going to get, because I think a lot of times consumers are not aware of how much the dollars made by black hair actually went back into the community.",
        "Historically it has been such a community builder.",
        "It's - universities have begun because of money made by black barbers.",
        "There's - people have bought their families out of slavery by money that they made on the side doing white hair and black hair.",
        "In the '60s and '70s and through the '80s, scholarship programs and breakfast programs were funded by black hair care companies; so I think it sounds like, oh, well, it's $2 cheaper so why wouldn't I buy this?",
        "What's the big deal?",
        "But the big deal is that these stores that now sell the products are not funneling the money back into the communities that they're in.",
        "I think if more consumers knew that it's not as simple as getting a cheaper bottle of shampoo, maybe people would actually walk into the black-owned store and purchase it.",
        "Well, I think the most interesting question is if you turn that question around - and this is what I'd like to ask John - if I ask a Korean person, in general, if there are two stores next to each other, and there was a Korean and an African-American store, and the product was $12 at the Korean store and $10 at the African-American store - John, where do you think, and answer honestly, most Koreans would shop?",
        "What's cheaper?",
        "The $10 store.",

        "Just type in black hair documentary at YouTube.com.",
        "You can watch the entire film at no charge.",
