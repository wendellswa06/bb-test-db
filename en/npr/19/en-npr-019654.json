        "Well, Aron, though, let - John, I'm going to get you in a second.",

        "But in your film, do you feel any sense of responsibility for creating an environment where Korean proprietors are seen as the enemy?",
        "This film is a wake-up call to all African-Americans to get this economic train moving in the neighborhoods, period.",
        "Can I add something though?",
        "I think that we have to look at outside of Koreans and Korean-Americans who own beauty supply stores in black neighborhoods.",
        "They were, for the most part, coming in and taking advantage of what was already an opening.",
        "In the '80s, during the Reagan era, a lot of black businesses shut down, a lot of beauty-supply businesses, a lot of businesses in general.",
        "And that was when we really started to see a growth of Korean-owned beauty supply stores because Korean-Americans have built credit associations where they can lend money within their associations to each other to start these businesses.",
        "And African-Americans did not - we didn't have that.",
        "So I think that it's not just, oh, Koreans have come in and locked it down.",
        "It's also that black people historically have a harder time getting a loan to open up a business.",
        "Now, there are other problems, which I think Aron went into great detail in his documentary, and looking at how it's hard, even if I did own a supply - a beauty-supply store, will I be able to get the supplies that I need from Korean-owned distributors?",
        "John -",

        "Let me go to John.",

        "No.",
        "One of the main things about this film that Mr. Aron had made that I disagree with is the focus on the whole racial issue and turning it into a racial issue, about black money and black communities.",
        "And when it comes down to it, it's about where an immigrant can come and set up a business to feed his family, basically.",
        "Okay, granted, it's in a black neighborhood, but -",
        "Well, I think that there's a couple of things that I would throw out on the table.",
        "One of them is that Korean-Americans and black Americans have had some traditional beef, which is true between, you know, many different ethnicities in different situations.",
        "But there has been some racial bad blood between Korean-Americans and black Americans.",
        "And secondly is that, you know, historically, when you look at black communities, a lot of vendors of different races or ethnicities have come through, and sometimes it's Lebanese-Americans, sometimes it's Korean-Americans, sometimes it's Jewish-Americans.",
        "And that has a lot to do with race and the structure of society, as well as personal decisions that people make.",
        "So knowing that is the back-story, do you ever feel an obligation to give back to the communities that you're located in, financially?",
        "I do.",
        "And whenever the opportunity may arise, whether it be through supporting a local high school or church or what have you, I see that opportunity and give what I can.",
        "But say a black person sets up a black beauty - or a beauty supply in a black neighborhood and makes a million dollars.",
        "Is he going to be throwing that million dollars back straight into that community?",
        "Historically, yes -",
        "He's like any other entrepreneur.",
        "He's going to go in and use that money for - as he sees fit.",
        "Ayena?",
        "I'm sorry to interrupt.",
        "Historically, yes.",
        "He wouldn't have given the million dollars back into the community.",
        "But a sizeable portion of it would have gone into community programs, either ones that maybe he helped to start or ones that already existed, whether it was a scholarship or breakfast program for children or giving a large amount of money to a school.",
        "So yes, actually, it was always something that historically black barbers and beauty salons and black beauty supply stores have done in their communities."

        "Ayena?",
        "I hope two things.",
        "One is that black business owners and potential black business owners can organize themselves in ways that Korean merchants have, which is giving ourselves credit associations within our community so that we can maybe have a chance to build those businesses that Aron just mentioned.",
        "I also hope that there can be more organizations that are coming up across the country to actually investigate whether or not there are problems getting - even if you do manage to open a store if you're black, making sure that you can get the products and that your products aren't being forced out and not distributed by the Korean-owned distributors.",
