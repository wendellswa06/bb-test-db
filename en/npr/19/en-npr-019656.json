        "One of the things that has changed is the percentage of women in that room.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "When I was at Newsweek magazine - which, you know, this really sounds like I walked four miles in the snow to school - but I started at Newsweek magazine in 1963, which was before the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",
        "So it was actually legal to discriminate against women, and Newsweek did.",
        "You could not be a writer if you were a woman.",
        "You know, I like to tell this to young people because they realize that women were discriminated against, but they don't always realize that it was actually legal.",
        "So, that was really an extraordinary difference.",
        "I wanted to read a paragraph from that column that we took from the Miami Herald on Sunday, December 27th.",
        "Today, half the law students and medical students are female, but only 15 of the Fortune 500 companies have female CEOs.",
        "We had the first serious woman candidate run for president and lose.",
        "We had a mother of five, a governor and a Title IX baby run for vice president as a conservative.",
        "Yes.",
        "Should we applaud or should we deplore, as we say in the editorial world?",
        "I mean, I think there's a lot of mixed messages, and there's been a lot of lopsided change.",
        "A lot of us thought - well, a lot of us thought originally that the women's movement was kind of a 10-point program that would be over in a few years.",
        "But there was also this belief, always, that the women's movement walked on two legs.",
        "With one, you would kick open doors that were closed to women and with the other, you would walk through, transforming society for men and women.",
        "And, of course, it turned out that it was easier to kick down some of those doors closed to women than to do the transformation.",
        "Glass ceilings have proved to be more fragile than lasting change.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, some of it is just - so many things happened simultaneously.",
        "One of the things that I also wrote about in the column, it just struck me as so ironic, is that the Equal Rights Amendment did not pass.",
        "And it didn't pass, in large measure, because people were concerned that women would end up in combat.",
        "And now in Iraq and Afghanistan, we've had a quarter of a million women serving.",
        "We've had 120 who died, and 650 were wounded.",
        "And we still don't have an Equal Rights Amendment.",
        "So the change, as I said, has been incredibly lopsided.",
        "We're talking with Pulitzer Prize winner Ellen Goodman.",
        "Her last column appears tomorrow - 800-989-8255.",
        "Email: talk@npr.org.",
        "And Kathy(ph) is on the line, calling us from Rochester, New York.",
        "Hi, thank you so much for the opportunity to say hello.",
        "Ellen, I just wanted to comment that years ago - I won't say how many...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I was in grad school in Boston and read one of your columns where it was such a snapshot of human life that it has stayed with me lo these many years.",
        "It was - I believe you were at the airport and observed parents exchanging children after a visit.",
        "And you compared it to the turn in a monastery.",
        "And that image and the poignancy of that interaction, for me, was just one of the wonderful ways in which your writing has captured all of us all these years."
