        "But being a columnist, you get to say, oh, and this is what I think.",
        "Yes.",
        "But you know, what I think the great achievement is, and this is true of any really fine writing or any work of art, for that matter, all of us maybe have these senses or these sensibilities, whatever you want to call them, or leanings or inclinations.",
