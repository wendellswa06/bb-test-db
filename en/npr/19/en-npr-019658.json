        "Yes, but you know, I think we also - it was the women's movement, also, that encouraged us because whatever our backgrounds were as children, I think this great, collective movement at a very crucial time in life - I think I - was 28 when I discovered the women's movement and that great collective energy and sense that we should - it was our time to be uppity.",

        "In my own family, probably the story that sticks in my mind the most is my niece, who is - just tried - she's a reproductive rights lawyer, something that didn't exist, and she just argued a case before the European Human Rights Court, and she was seven months pregnant when she did, when she argued it.",

        "And it was really - I watched the Web cast, and I thought, now, there you go.",
        "That's tremendous.",
        "That's just a phenomenal change.",
        "Or for that matter, my daughter, who runs a women's comedy troupe.",
        "Well, that didn't - that wasn't really open a generation ago.",
