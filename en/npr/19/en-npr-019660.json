        "US District Judge Claudia Wilkin recently acknowledged the threat to Jews in California prisons.",
        "In her preliminary ruling on the Lieb case in September, she said it was unreasonable to believe Jews could practice their religion when housed with anti-Semitic gang members, but she declined to make a final judgment pending the outcome of Johnson vs. California.",
        "That's the case heard by the US Supreme Court last February, challenging California's use of race to make prison housing assignments.",
        "Though the high court ruled that the practice was `likely unconstitutional,' it sent the case back to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to demonstrate why California's racial classifications were necessary.",
        "California Corrections spokeswoman Margo Bach offers her own explanation.",
        "Generally speaking, inmates like to be housed with like inmates.",
        "They want to be from the same neighborhood.",
        "They want to be of the same racial background in a cell.",
        "But what does it mean to be of the same racial background if your skin is white but your faith and culture is Jewish?",
        "Prison doctor Corey Weinstein puts it this way.",
        "In America, white-skin privilege is real, and Jews in America benefit from it.",
        "But in the prison system, in facing, you know, the white racist gangs, it's a different story.",
        "And that, says those who are following this case, exposes the delicate nature of race as a social construct, which in the case of Stephan Lieb can be changed with the ease of a keystroke.",
        "The accommodation I'm asking for doesn't involve an expenditure of a lot of money or resources.",
        "All it takes is, on the computer, changing my designation from W-H-I for white to O-T-H for other.",
        "Some prison officials do wonder if Lieb is making himself more of a target by pursuing this case in the courts.",
        "For now, Lieb is serving out his time sharing a cell with a Vietnamese inmate who's reportedly so impressed with Lieb's cause that he's starting to convert to Judaism.",
        "Phillip Martin, NPR News.",
        "Before Twitter, radio, even electricity - in fact, going all the way back to pre-historic times, people gathered around fires to listen to stories.",
        "Even though the glow of computers has replaced the warmth of the campfire for most of us, some folks still hold fast to the tradition of oral storytelling.",
        "As Missy Shelton reports, nearly 10,000 people have gathered this weekend for the National Storytelling Festival in northeast Tennessee to hear professional tellers weave some good yarns."

        "In a five/four decision today, with Justice Kennedy providing a crucial fifth vote with the four conservative justices, the Court said, nope, that's just too broad a definition of what waters of the United States means.",

        "In a six/three vote, the Supreme Court said, nope, this is a special population.",

        "Today they granted Circ(ph) on another partial-birth abortion case that came out of the Ninth Circuit.",
        "The difference between the two cases, the one they had already agreed to hear, essentially is going to determine whether this, quote, \"\"partial-birth abortion legislation that had been passed in 2003, is unconstitutional because it doesn't provide an exception for the health of the mother.\"\" That was what Sandra Day O'Connor test had become, the last time the Court heard this.",
        "Today's case is a little bit more narrow, a little bit more specific.",
        "They said they're going to also tackle the question not only of that statute's constitutionality, but what the remedy will be.",
        "In other words, if it turns that the health exception is necessary, does the entire partial-birth abortion ban become unconstitutional on its face?",
        "So they're going to figure out whether the entire ban would go down the toilet if a part of it is unconstitutional.",
        "And that almost has a larger ultimate bearing than the narrow question of whether the ban itself is unconstitutional."
