        "Mr.",
        "McCRACKEN: Well, from what I understand is the way Western programming airs in Japan is - they can't really air on the main networks.",
        "They basically air on, like, satellite or terrestrial television.",
        "So it didn't really get the kind of wide audience that, just, programs that are made in Asia usually get.",
        "The market penetration is that I think they call it.",
        "Mr.",
        "McCRACKEN: Yeah, yeah.",
        "It wasn't really exposed as big as it could be.",
        "But you would think, I mean, just looking at the Powerpuff Girls, they seem to have been, at least in part, inspired by Japanese anime.",
        "Mr.",
        "McCRACKEN: Yeah, I thought of it - a lot of the action sequences that we have in the show were definitely inspired by anime, but the characters themselves are really inspired by Margaret and Walter Keene paintings from the '60s, if you're familiar with those.",
        "Sure, the very big eyes.",
        "Mr.",
        "McCRACKEN: Yeah, yeah.",
        "It was kind of combination between them and like, you know, Jay Ward-type cartooning stuff.",
        "But we always had, like, anime influence within our action sequences and stuff.",
        "And so then, it was decided that maybe if they had a slightly different look - and it turned out to be not so slightly different - they might do better in Japan.",
        "Mr.",
        "McCRACKEN: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Some of the Asian networks came to us and they wanted to produce their own version of \"\"Powerpuff Girls,\"\" and they felt they could do well, but it needed to be done and produced by an Asian studio and sort of, like, you know, then, we can air it on, like, TV Tokyo or whatever.",
        "And how did that changed them?"

        "Mr.",
        "McCRACKEN: They just really wanted to kind of re-envision the property.",
        "And when the idea was first pitched to me, the first thing I thought of was \"\"Batman.\"\" I mean, here is the character that's been reinterpreted so many different ways from the original Bob Kane version to the Adam West version to the Frank Miller version, and they all - its core is still \"\"Batman.\"\" The foundation of the character is still the same.",
        "So I said, well, as long you keep that core foundation the same, you know, feel free to, you know, reinterpret or re-imagine it in a way that you feel is going to better play in your marketplace.",
        "And they come out being a lot less abstract.",
        "They look like - well, not like real girls, but a lot more like real girls.",
        "Mr.",
        "McCRACKEN: Mm-hmm.",
        "Yeah, and I think maybe one reason that was is because things like fashion is such a big component in Japan, and they thought, well, you know, these tiny little bodies that I gave them, they really couldn't kind of dress them as well as they could if they kind of stretched them out and made them, you know, much more, a little human proportion.",
        "And so girls in Japan will buy the same clothes that the Powerpuff Girls wear?",
        "Mr.",
        "McCRACKEN: Yeah, possibly.",
        "Yeah, maybe, or it's just, you know, it's just they get more diverse things in the drawing, you know?",
        "They can have street clothes and then there are superhero outfits and various different things, and it's just like another visual element that they feel is important to their type of programming.",
        "And if you saw them, if you just happened to turn on your TV and saw them, would you recognize them?",
        "Mr.",
        "McCRACKEN: Yeah.",
        "The main designs are still the same, you know.",
        "The -Blossom's a redhead and Buttercup's a brunette and, you know, Bubbles as, you know, the blonde pigtails.",

        "Give us some other examples, if you would.",

        "I don't know.",
        "Well, some other example - \"\"Sesame Street,\"\" when they launched - well, \"\"Sesame Street's\"\" been in India for a while, but they recently replaced Big Bird with Boombah, a Bhangra-dancing lion, which is a type of dance popular in Bollywood movies.",

        "That's right.",
        "This is fascinating.",
        "This is a company that is so careful about its copyrights that, you know, it still has Western women playing Cinderella and Snow White in Hong Kong Disneyworld, and in Tokyo Disney.",
        "Yet, it's come out with a line of Cuties, which is a line of, kind of - taking the Hello Kitty aesthetic of a little, tiny mouth and kind of a smushier face that is popular across Asia and launched that in China and Japan, and elsewhere."
