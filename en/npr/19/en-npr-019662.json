        "So, I'm not really involved in the daily production of that show and supervising things, and kind of giving my comments on it.",
        "I was really just there in the initial conception of it.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And one of the ideas was if you wanted to make it fly in Asia, you better turn this creative end of it over to Asians.",
        "Mr.",
        "McCRACKEN: Yeah.",
        "And one big issue that we did deal with with the show is when they first pitched their concept, the character of Professor Utonium wasn't in it and they just had, you know, those three girls, you know, off fighting crime.",
        "And I said, well, they really need a father figure, they really need someone to look after them.",
        "And it didn't - and they thought it was weird.",
        "They said, wasn't it strange that there's a single father with three daughters?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Mr.",
        "McCRACKEN: And they didn't realize it was a cultural thing in Asia, where the idea of a single father who, possibly, you know, has been divorced or, you know, whose wife is passed away, that typically in those situations, a husband would remarry or, you know, the children would go with the mother.",
        "And so, they were, you know, really resistant to having him be their actual biological father.",
        "But I said, they at least need a father figure in the show.",
        "So, is he now back in the show in some other slightly different capacity?",
        "Mr.",
        "McCRACKEN: Yeah.",
        "He is back in the show as just, kind of parental figure.",

        "There's a lot of anime that's produced that's very much for adults, and we understand that there's a market for that.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But I think that just plays into the kind of the taste for animation there and also, the appeal that it has towards grown men or a joke Craig was speaking about, Otaku in Japan - also called geeks - are very into animation and they like this aesthetic of the long legs and the doe-eyed girls.",
        "Mr. McCRACKEN: Mm-hmm.",

        "I - hopefully - you know, because I'm a big fan of the classics -they weren't trying to replace them, and hopefully, it was just like an attempt to see almost like a transcreation here, just to see - will kids like them better if they're edgier and…",
