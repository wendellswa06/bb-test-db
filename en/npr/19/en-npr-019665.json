        "So, you know, I get very - I live in Virginia, and it's really very focused on the homophobia in terms of how people deal with this has been really awful, because there're people dying and yet they won't - that they will point to the Bible and talk about something about, you know, gay people or that homosexuality is a sin.",
        "But even if that were the case, which it is not, people are more than homosexual.",
