        "Just a handful of cases in some hospitals in major cities - remind us, what did you think was going on at the time?",
        "Oh, I think it was a lot of bafflement, to use a word that I used in one of the first stories that we had back in 1981.",
        "You know, the words that popped out are mysterious epidemic, touched off one of the most intense medical sleuthing episodes since toxic shock syndrome appeared on the scene last year.",
        "Of course, in retrospect, toxic shock nobody talks about that anymore, fortunately.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "But we, I think it's fair to say nobody really had any notion that we were going to be talking 25 years later about a continuing pandemic everywhere in the world.",
        "You know, 65 million people infected, 25 million of them have died.",

        "But it was, it was a mystery, I think, compelled a lot of attention initially among a certain small group of doctors - the infectious disease specialists who recognized that this was probably something to do with an infectious disease agent and something clearly to do with the immune system, but who really for a long time didn't - well, for months and months didn't know what they were dealing with.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Give us a sense on how it was being reported in 1981, when we knew so little about it and there were so many misconceptions.",
        "Well, it wasn't being reported very much, unfortunately.",
        "Occasionally, articles would pop up in the major papers.",
        "I don't think anybody reported on the June 5th article in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which is the CDC publication, that the anniversary of that first report we're observing in another week or so.",
        "So, it was pretty obscure.",
        "Occasionally, there would be a small article in a medical journal that would get picked up, and then it would sink beneath the surface for most people and from most doctors for that matter.",
        "When it did get reported?",
        "I think it was, you know, it was the old - it reminds me of the blind men and the elephant, grappling different parts of it and trying to figure out what this beast was, and how big it was.",
        "For instance, my colleague Larry Altman of the New York Times had an article in July of 1981 that talked about 41 cases of Kaposi's sarcoma in gay men in New York, and that was pretty weird.",
        "Because this is a - at that time, was a type of rare cancer…",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "…blood vessel cancer that was only seen in elderly men in Africa.",
        "So, you know, there was no sense in that report, because nobody could know that all these things were connected.",
        "And it ultimately was a retrovirus that was causing all of these manifestations.",
        "As you say, we all learned new words, new language - Kaposi's sarcoma, pneumocystis.",
        "Yet, this presented in so many different ways, the underlying aspect of it, the immune system - that was realized pretty early on.",
        "Yes, that was the big obvious thing, is that something was causing the immune systems of these otherwise, you know, healthy, young people to collapse entirely.",
        "And they would get this whole range of diseases, infections that don't normally - you know, people even who were immunocompromised by virtue of the fact that they're taking drugs to prevent rejection of transplant organs.",
        "You know, they sometimes get some of these, but not the kind of fulminant, out of control infections across the board that are being seen in people who weren't immunosuppressed for any known reason.",
        "And these were, not only pneumocystis crania pneumonia, which is a very unusual pneumonia before then, but also fungal diseases and cytomegalovirus and a, you know, whole range of things.",
        "Very unpredictable and hard to interpret just how they were all popping up."

        "When did you realize that they were all connected?",
        "Well, I think right from the get-go, in San Francisco, it was a disease of gay men.",

        "And that immediately made one think about a sexually transmitted disease.",
        "So I don't think we thought they were a whole sort of separate - but also, actually, what we saw in San Francisco was very much Kaposi's sarcoma in the early days, which is one reason oncologists led most of the research in San Francisco and still do.",
        "Hm.",

        "And, of course, there aren't any transmissible cancers.",
        "So this was a kind of shocking thing to hear, and it was the thing that caused me to want to sort of leap into this disease and find out what was happening and study it.",
        "Plus, it was in my neighborhood.",
        "And there was - you said - immediately suspected sexually transmitted disease, but who knew?",
        "Even on this side.",
        "Who knew and that's what - I'm an epidemiologist, and that's what our job was, to find out who was getting it and how serious it was and how it was being transmitted and whether it would spread to the wider world.",

        "And how did you communicate?",
        "I mean, since so little information was available, you know, it's difficult to say, you know, at the time, because there were so many rumors.",
        "There was so much fear as this spread and grew, you know, what was accurate, what was true?",
        "We had - at one point, I think it was Margaret Heckler, the secretary of health, I think in 1984 announced that scientists had found that HIV was the cause of AIDS, and said a vaccine was going to be available in two years.",
        "Yeah, I think that's right.",
        "A lot of bad things were said, often for political reasons.",
        "And it was very difficult.",
        "And it was very difficult in the first couple of years, because it wasn't until 1984 that the virus was identified.",
        "And once it was identified, you could have a blood test and then you could tell who was infected and you could really see what was happening.",
        "But for the first two years - really through 1982 and 1983 - there was a huge cloud of fear.",
        "And part of that fear was whether this virus would spread to the general heterosexual population.",
        "And that, of course, laid a kind of whole level of paranoia over working in AIDS, in those days, and made people very frightened - frightened about that they might catch it, but also frightened that there might be severe political backlash.",
        "And one of the things I think we've forgotten about was how tense a political situation it was working in AIDS those first few years.",
        "At UCSF, a group of researchers - I suspect including yourself - decided to investigate this.",
        "In those early days, were you able to get funding?",
        "Well, that was a real disaster.",
        "I mean, I have to say, the federal funding mechanism, which - the National Institutes of Health - did respond, but they responded on their normal timetable, which is kind of like the timetable of a glacier, you know?",
        "It flows very slowly.",
        "So, although we did start writing grant proposals in 1982, it took a very long time to get any money.",
        "And what many of us at UCSF ended up doing, including myself, was going to the city of San Francisco for research funds.",
        "As you probably know, that doesn't happen very often.",
        "And in order to do it, we had to mobilize the gay political community, which in those days in San Francisco was very developed.",
        "There were enormous, grassroots, gay political clubs, the biggest in the country.",
        "And they, I have to say, responded really well to this situation and realized immediately that they had to help us, the researchers - not necessarily their natural allies -to go to the city of San Francisco and then the state to raise money, so that we could get working really before the kind of glacial, federal machinery finally clicked into action.",
        "And that's what we did.",
        "And it was a very strange process, because I, for example, would be going around the gay political clubs in San Francisco giving my speech, which was kind of a horrific speech in those days.",
        "It was a sort of a you're-all-going-to-die speech.",
        "And getting past the reaction to that and trying to convince people that this is something they really need to be mobilized about.",
        "And then, seeing them get mobilized and do it, which was really, actually, a wonderful experience.",
        "We're talking today about living with AIDS for 25 years.",
        "Of course, over the course of that quarter century, 25 million people - estimated - have died from it.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And Richard Knox, let me ask another question: when, in terms of the federal funding, did this glacier that Dr. Moss was describing finally get moving?"
