        "Oh, I think it took a couple of years before real money started flowing, but, you know, that's a crucial couple of years.",
        "And, then of course, it didn't all - we didn't begin spending billions as we now do.",
        "But I think it's not just the glacial quality of federal bureaucracy and business as usual in the NIH grant process.",
        "I think that there was active resistance to spending money on this particular disease because is was immediately and widely seen as a disease of gay men, and only later, I suppose, as of intravenous drug users.",
        "And there certainly were - it's well documented and told by a number of people now how much difficulty the people in the CDC were having in getting just basic money to do the epidemiology to try to figure out how big this thing was and where it might be going.",
        "I mean, the CDC is responsible for monitoring infectious diseases, and they had to beg, borrow, steal, and use subterfuge in order to move money around for quite a long time at the beginning of this epidemic.",
        "Andrew Moss, of course, progress has been made.",
        "It is treatable.",
        "It's expensive, but treatable.",
        "There is certainly no cure, though, and rates of transmission are disturbingly in some parts of the world.",
        "Where do you think we are now with AIDS?",
        "Well, I've had the experience of working in Africa the last couple of years and seeing the beginnings of anti-retroviral treatment in Africa - in east Africa in my case.",
        "And that has been a really amazing experience.",
        "And I have to say, I feel very upbeat about it.",
        "I think that the world did an amazing thing from a public health point of view in the last couple of years in taking this very expensive and difficult treatment and disseminating it in developing countries.",
        "Now, it's only the first step.",
        "It's going to be very difficult, and I don't know what the political commitment is to keeping this funded, but I think this has been truly amazing, and I'm very encouraged by it, and I urge everybody to kind of push for that to keep going.",
        "Because what we've really done is faced up to the issue of AIDS in Africa - where, you know, maybe something like 70 percent of the world's AIDS is - and the fact that for it to be treated in Africa - and we don't have a vaccine, so it has to be treated - for it to be treated in Africa, we and other rich countries have to put up the money, basically.",
        "And we have done step one, and now there's step two, three, four, five, six to come that we have to keep doing it for.",
        "The ugliness has been on full display on social media channels.",
        "Here's one video taken on a metro train in the San Francisco Bay area by a woman speaking a foreign language.",
        "A fellow passenger tells her she's a terrorist and Trump might just deport her.",
        "Yeah, I've read estimates that of the 40 million estimated to have the HIV infection, 30 million are in Africa.",
        "And, of course, that's going to mean an awful many of them young, and it's going to mean a lot orphan children.",
        "But, as they point out, with anti-retrovirals, big difference between an orphan at the age of three and an orphan at the age of 15.",
        "Yeah, and people do live.",
        "I think for everybody who worked in a - I mean, you're right.",
        "We don't have, as it were, a perfect cure.",
        "But for people who worked in AIDS, what happened when the triple therapy with anti-retrovirals came along was kind of miraculous.",
        "That is, you suddenly saw people who you had been accustomed to die suddenly turn around and live and get jobs and go back to work again, you know.",
        "And that has been a spectacular thing, and it's made working in AIDS optimistic, you know, for the first time in a long time.",

        "And to somewhat less degree, but a growing degree, of Hispanics.",
        "And I think that has, you know, partly to do with poverty and the sad fact that ethnic minorities are a lot more likely to be poor, are more likely to have less education, or less likely to be reached by the kinds of prevention efforts that we did so well in the early days of the epidemic in the United States in changing the behaviors of men who have sex with men.",
        "I say we - I mean, that community did it's own self-education to a remarkable degree, and then forced the federal government eventually to pay attention.",
        "The federal government's putting money into AIDS prevention, and you know, has a lot of programs now aimed at various parts of society, but clearly, it's not getting the job done in places where it's growing fastest."

        "Changing behavior is a long process, but I can describe very briefly that there was a (unintelligible)-pronged approach to addressing HIV and AIDS.",
        "And one very important prong of that is the leadership.",
        "We had a very, very early opportunity, an advantage that the president took it upon himself to be open about the disease.",
        "And in his campaigns and addressing people, he would openly encourage people to change and beware.",
        "But also, very importantly, he would encourage people to change and beware, but also very importantly, it would encourage people to be compassionate and care for those that have HIV and AIDS.",
        "But also, there was, very early, grass roots campaigns of explaining to people how AIDS is transmitted, how HIV is transmitted, and how it isn't transmitted.",
        "But a very important element of that, and the third prong, is the involvement of people who had been personally affected; positive people, families like mine that, at the time, were nursing loved ones who had HIV.",

        "And many of these are women who have, because of poverty, have not been able to go to school; and because they haven't gone to school, they're, even the media, through which information is transmitted, is completely out of their reach.",

        "They can't take care of the children without their husband, so they remain in that situation and they get infected.",
        "Earlier, Andrew Moss, and epidemiologist who's been to Africa, says he's very encouraged by what's happened in Uganda and Kenya, and other places in Africa.",
