        "Are they required to use the camera then when they're in those off-duty situations?",
        "During the pilot project, off-duty officers did not wear the cameras.",
        "Going forward, we don't know how they're going to issue these cameras and use them.",

        "Later this year, they're going to field about 800 body cameras for a force that has about 1,400 officers.",
        "And for the incidents that were recorded, were there any use-of-force incidents that were investigated using video from body cameras?",
        "Yeah.",

        "It was inappropriate, and the officer was suspended for four days.",
        "Now, during that incident, there were seven officers who responded, but only three captured the actual use of force with their cameras.",
        "So Noelle, there have been similar kinds of findings about police body cameras in other cities - Rialto, Calif., New Orleans.",
        "Do you have a sense that there are things that are going to change or lessons for police departments going forward?",
        "Yemen.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The independent monitor said from the beginning that he wanted to evaluate this and take a look at it as the policy is being developed so that it can be the best that it can be rather than letting it go for a year and saying, oh, whoops, we found all these problems.",
        "This is important.",

        "So lots of groups are saying, hey, let's consider all these recommendations.",

        "I'm much less concerned, quite frankly, about what you call an assault weapon than I am about magazines, and the number of rounds that can be held in a magazine.",
        "Banning magazines that carry lots of rounds can force shooters to reload more often and give law enforcement time to disrupt an attack, Biden says.",
