        "You know, it's like you could put the camera on her face and you just see this whole world that she has inside of her that's so beyond her years.",

        "Once you did find her, how much did she dictate or determine the character?",

        "It's all about finding these things that speak to us and then adapting the script to those elements.",

        "You know, sort of, I would - before she ever looked at anything from the story or the script, I would say, tell me about what happens at the end of the world.",
        "And she would describe these - you know, her vision of that, which was these crazy things with people's hands falling off and their clothes burning up and a light in the sky turning on and off really fast, like all these visions that she has.",
        "Wow.",
        "And I remember - this is just one example, but I remember asking her, you know, if all of these things were your fault, what would you do?",
        "And she said, I would just try to fix it.",
        "You know, I would do whatever I can to fix what I broke.",

        "I would - something I never would have thought of, you know, that her concept is the way that you fix something is not by, you know, trying to - she knows she can't change the world, that she's too small to actually change anything big, but she can be good.",
        "And, by being good, somehow, you can rectify what you've thrown off in the universe.",

        "It's very, very collaborative on every level.",
        "I'm talking to Ben Zeitlin about his movie, \"\"Beasts of the Southern Wild.\"\" There's a fascinating mixture in the movie between all of this realism, this ramshackle community on the coast and then this mythical element, these magical beasts, prehistoric beasts called Aurochs that are on a rampage.",
        "Talk about the dynamic between those two things, the realism and then the magical part.",
        "Yeah.",
        "For me, you know, it wasn't - we spent a long time trying to, like, grasp at just what that line was.",

        "You know, those lines are totally blurred when you're that age.",
        "You know, I remember having an invisible friend when I was that age and, you know, if my invisible friend, like, didn't show up to play with me, I would be sad.",
        "You know, that was a real emotion generated by something that adults were telling me wasn't there.",
        "And so, you know, these beasts and sort of all of the mythical elements of the film are things that Hushpuppy believes are real and the film doesn't kind of condescend towards that point of view.",
        "It sort of takes her at her word and anything that she believes is real is real in the film.",
        "And so she's living in this extremely heightened state where she sees herself as this tiny little morsel of food on the planet that larger predators are going to come and eat, whether that's her father who's going to be taken away by disease or her home's going to be taken away by storms in the ocean.",
        "And, as that projects itself, these, you know, ancient, extinct creatures defrost out of the ice caps as they're crumbling and wake back up and come charging to get her.",
        "What does Quvenzhane think about all the attention and praise the movie's getting and her, in particular?",
        "Thank you.",
        "You know, she's - you know, she's little.",
        "It's not like she was raised to be some star or something or have a sense of what any of this stuff is.",
        "You know, we were always getting asked, you know, what's next?",
        "And she very coolly says, you know, fourth grade.",
