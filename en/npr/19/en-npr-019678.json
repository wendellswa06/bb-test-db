        "The prominent and polarizing abortion doctor George Tiller was killed today, gunned down during morning services at his church in Wichita, Kansas.",
        "Dr.",
        "Tiller ran one of the few clinics in the country that performs late-term abortions.",
        "For decades, he was a key figure in the battle over abortion in Kansas and on the national stage.",
        "A suspect has been arrested.",
        "Police haven't identified him, but a deputy chief said he was 51 years old and will be charged with murder.",
        "I talked earlier with reporter Stan Finger who's covering the story for the Wichita Eagle newspaper.",
        "We're told that Dr. Tiller was serving as an usher at the church this morning, and a man approached him and opened fire.",
        "Apparently Dr. Tiller was the only one shot, and then the suspect challenged another person at the church and left.",
        "And Dr. Tiller was pronounced dead?",
        "Yes.",
        "He was pronounced dead at the scene right there at the church.",
        "I understand that someone is now in custody.",
        "What do we know about the suspect?",
        "We don't know much at this point, just that someone was taken into custody just south of Kansas City.",
        "So that's about three hours away."

        "Yeah, just about.",
        "Apparently this is someone that has been seen at the church before because abortion opponents would protest outside the church where Dr. Tiller attended services on a fairly regular basis, and this is someone that members of the congregation have seen before.",
        "Dr.",
        "Tiller's clinic was bombed in 1986.",
        "And in the early '90s, he was shot in both arms.",
        "And just a few months ago, he was acquitted in a criminal case.",
        "He'd been charged with violating a Kansas law that required two independent doctors to agree that a late-term abortion is necessary.",
        "What made Dr. Tiller literally such a target?",
        "I believe he was targeted because he was one of the few doctors in the country that performed late-term abortions.",
        "Over time, he became a lightning rod for opponents of abortion.",
        "And accordingly, those who supported abortion rights would rally to his defense.",
        "So in many ways, he was at the forefront of the abortion debate in the country.",
        "So how have abortion rights opponents in Kansas reacted to today's shooting?",
        "Universal shock and dismay.",
        "I spoke with the president of Operation Rescue, which organized the 1991 Summer of Mercy campaign in which they blockaded Dr. Tiller's clinic, and he was so stunned, he was virtually speechless.",
        "Other groups that oppose abortion have expressed dismay, and they're very upset that this happened.",
        "And supporters?",
        "Well, they're grieving profoundly.",
        "The National Organization for Women called him a champion of women.",
        "Other organizations that support abortion rights are praising him for his services and are expressing outrage at what's taken place.",
        "Well, we'll keep following this story.",
        "Reporter Stan Finger of the Wichita Eagle, we thank you for taking the time.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "And as Republicans with presidential ambitions work out how closely to stand by Mr. Bush's war policy, we turn to NPR senior correspondent Juan Williams to analyze this distancing dilemma."

        "But generally speaking, aren't Republicans in a difficult position here?",
        "Absolutely, Renee.",
        "None of the current Republican candidates is calling for a pull-out or an end to funding for the war, despite polls that show overwhelming public opposition to the president's so-called surge plan.",
        "There's been an overall calculation by the Republican candidates that they should stand with President Bush in hopes of winning over the far right of the party.",
        "This puts the Republican candidates in a difficult position, as you just said, their support for the war in the GOP primaries is likely to leave them in a weakened position for the general election when they'll need to attract independent and swing voters.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, turning to individual candidates, where does that put Arizona Senator John McCain?",
        "We're hearing a lot of a really big support from him for the president.",
        "Right, Renee.",
        "He's the strongest voice of support on Capitol Hill for the president's decision to send 21,500 more troops to Iraq, the so-called Surge Plan.",
        "He's called for actually more U.S.",
        "troops in Iraq for three years, and that demand was ignored even as the violence in Iraq escalated.",
        "And the senator, Senator McCain, was often treated by the White House as a loud, troubling critic of the president's policy.",
        "And thank you.",
        "But now, the former Navy flyer finds himself standing shoulder to shoulder with the president on the surge and risking his reputation as an independent, even a maverick Republican voice.",
        "He's in the politically precarious posture now of supporting an unpopular president and an unpopular war, to build support with a conservative base that has never, never been comfortable with him.",
        "Of course, if he manages to do that, ahead, he can always say, look, I said three years ago they needed more troops.",
        "So can sort of back out of this if it's a problem.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that's exactly right.",
        "That's the posture he's taken so far."

        "Any other top candidates?",

        "Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, endorses the Bush plan to increase the number of troops for now.",
        "Or, as he puts it this week - here I'm quoting, As long as there's a reasonable prospect of success.",
        "Romney also recently told Iowa voters that he feels the war has been poorly managed.",
        "He expressed the worry that it's already hurt Republican candidates in last year's midterm elections, and is likely to lead to more victories for Democrats in '08.",
        "And what about a much talked about candidate, Rudolph Giuliani?",
        "The former mayor of New York is leading in some early polls, Renee.",
        "He consistently says that he supports President Bush and adding more troops.",
        "But, from there, he adds a lot of nuance to his support.",
        "He cautions that the surge might not work and that victory in Iraq is not likely to come from military strength.",
        "He said it's more likely to come from ideas and diplomatic efforts.",
        "Giuliani also says that too much focus has been put on Iraq, as opposed to looking at the broader issue of the war on terror.",
        "So, Romney and Giuliani, Renee, might be characterized as a step away from Senator McCain in their embrace of the surge and President Bush's handling of the war.",
        "Now, Sam Brownback, senator from Kansas, who was once a big supporter of this war, but he's changed his position.",
        "Tell us about that.",
        "After a recent trip to Iraq, Renee, Senator Brownback said sectarian violence, not terrorists, is the major problem in Iraq.",
        "He's now one of the rare Republicans in the Senate to publicly oppose the troop surge and offer support for a non-binding resolution opposing more troops.",
        "But last week, Senator Brownback sided with President Bush and with his fellow Republicans in blocking a debate about the war on the Senate floor.",
        "So he's kind of an outlier here, a little bit distanced from McCain and a little bit distance, certainly, from Giuliani and the others.",
        "Juan, what about Chuck Hagle, senator from Nebraska, outright opponent of the president's position in Iraq, and impossible candidate.",
        "Is he it?",
        "Is he the only one that's really out there in fierce opposition?",
        "He's the one, Renee.",
        "The senator from Nebraska is siding with the Democrats publicly in opposing this surge.",
        "He has not yet decided to run, as you say, but he is considering it.",
        "And he would offer the only strong alternative in all the Republicans now looking to win the GOP nomination for president.",
        "Juan, thanks very much."
