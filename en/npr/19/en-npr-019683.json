        "Blackmond and her colleagues realized there were two key factors.",
        "One was which amino acid they used in their experiments, the other had to do with the relationship between the amount of amino acid that was dissolved in the soup versus the amount that had formed crystals as the soup evaporated.",
        "She says you can imagine an amino acid laden puddle sitting on earth's surface, as the puddle evaporated and left more crystals, it would reach a point where the conditions were just right for one form to win out over the other; and if the earliest life evolved from the amino acids in a left handed puddle, that would explain why today we live in a left handed world.",
