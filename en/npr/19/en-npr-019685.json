        "OK, yeah, always.",

        "Do you think it's because she picked a candidate in this race?",
        "I think, that's probably partially what it is.",
        "I mean, she does have a very mainstream audience of women, who - a lot of them supported Hillary Clinton, so I'm sure that has something to do with it.",
        "But I also take it just a sign of the time.",
        "I mean, she's been dominant for a very long time, and you know, there comes a time when that ends, or it certainly begins to fall off a little bit, and I sort of think it's a combination of both.",
        "I don't think it's just her support of Obama, because if you think about it, she really has not really been out there supporting him since January.",
        "She did her thing and she pretty much stepped away from it.",
        "But I think that when you combine that with the fact that she's dominated for 20 years, and Ellen now is sort of the popular person with all the celebrity guests, I just think it's time to pass the mantle on some level.",
        "Oprah can pass the mantle anytime and still be a billionaire.",
        "Definitely.",
        "And an entrepreneur, multimedia business owner.",
        "Nonetheless, if you are that good at something, it's got to sting a little bit, doesn't it?",
        "See, I don't think it does.",
        "I think that Oprah is at a point in her career and in her life where she's done what she wants to do.",
        "I think that that's why she felt comfortable coming out for Obama, because I think she understood that that might affect her ratings.",
        "I think, she felt like, you know what?",
        "This - I've succeeded far beyond anybody's expectations, so now I can take a stand and take the hit, if there is one to come.",
        "So, I think she's fine with it.",
        "I think she is looking forward to her next, you know, sort of you know, plateau, on, like, where she goes from here.",
        "So, there have been cases where people have criticized her for not following Christian doctrine, because she promotes spiritual authors like Eckhart Tolle.",
        "People will criticize her for any number of reasons...",

        "I can see her doing - I mean, I know one of the things that she told me when I interviewed for her school in South Africa is that she really wanted to spend much more time there.",
        "She wanted to actually build a house, and I think she is building a house on the property, and she wanted to live there.",
        "I think it's the craft.",
        "I think theatre is the true craft of acting.",

        "...And point taken.",
        "Nice job.",
        "So, I can just sort of see her just slowly getting out of the spotlight, because, I mean, that's - she's had a 20-year run at just being always on the front page, and people always around her, and media always there.",
        "I mean, I think, at this point, she would just would like to take a break for a minute, produce, you know, sort of help other people, but I'm not sure that she wants that in front of the camera thing for - in the next ten years.",
        "I'm not sure that's where she wants to be.",

        "What do you think?",
        "Well, it was beneath her, but I sort of feel like, even more so, it was a very clumsy - she was a very clumsy addition to it.",
        "She didn't really fit in the movie, when I saw it.",
        "I felt like you know, someone like Kelly Rowland, or someone with the - you know, not as big as a profile as Jennifer would have been better.",
        "I also sort of feel as though, with Jennifer, though, as with the other African-American actress, it's going to be hard finding roles that equal \"\"Dream Girls.",
        "So, I think, you know, I didn't expect her to do anything huge after \"\"Dream Girls.\"\" I think that's just sort of the name of the game.",
        "When you're an African-American actress, you take what you can get.",
        "And this is a big film.",
        "It's a small role, but it's in a huge movie that will probably do incredibly well.",
        "I just thought she was ill-fitted.",
        "I didn't think she belonged in it."

        "MS. SAMUELS: Right.",
        "What do you think she would have done with it?",
        "I just think it would have been less awkward in the sense of - Jennifer has a presence that's overwhelming, and it didn't really make sense for her to have such a small role.",
        "Now, part of it is that I just think the movie itself, and \"\"Sex and the City,\"\" had ignored African-Americans for the entire run on TV, and it just felt like, OK, let's just throw one in now, because, you know, we don't want to hear any sort of criticism.",
        "So - but Kelly, I think, would have brought that sort of, you know, it-girl kind of quality to it, because she's a fashionista, and I don't look at Jennifer Hudson in the same way.",
        "I don't get that from her.",
        "So, that's why I thought it was a really awkward fit.",

        "When you're the only person on stage, that is very hard to sort of do.",
        "So I can sort of see him being sort of not shoe-in, but certainly the favorite.",
        "What else are we seeing on Broadway in terms of, you know, people of color and nominations?",
        "Well, Morgan Freeman is in \"\"Country Girl\"\" now.",
        "And I've not seen it, but I really want to see it because it's supposedly very, very good, and I - just to see him on Broadway, because I've never really thought of him as a Broadway actor, even though I know he's done theatre for a long time.",
        "But I've never seen that.",
        "So I thinks that's sort of where the buzz is now, to actually go to Broadway and just see him on stage.",
        "Because I think you see actors in a totally different way when they're on stage and - it's them.",
        "You get the essence of who they are from that stage performance, and to see it be consistent every night, you know, because with Laurence, he does two or three performances on weekends."

        "And I know as an actor, you have to do that, anyway, but on stage, you have no - there's no room for error.",
        "When you think about how acting unfolds in American public life, there are a lot of people - most people who we know as actors, I mean, certainly who I know, are people who act in movies or television who we can see kind of as a big group of Americans.",
        "Right.",
