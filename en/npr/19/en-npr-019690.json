        "So we're only down about four to five percent of employees.",
        "So at this point, we have a base to build up again, and then we'll increase on the production side.",
        "But as I said, at this point, we're cautiously optimistic, and we've investing in areas that we think will drive sales going forward.",
        "And I wonder, in terms of the job applicants you're seeing, are you getting people who are - well, describe their qualifications for us, if you would.",
        "It's kind of a difficult conundrum.",
        "We - you know, you would think with higher unemployment, the number of applicants would be increasing, you know, the skill level would be increasing, but that hasn't been the case for us.",
        "We've had a lot of difficulty finding the skill sets we're looking for, even though, you know, the numbers would tell you otherwise.",
        "So even though you're getting a large number of applicants, the people who are qualified for these jobs is relatively small.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, you need good, qualified people, well-trained, to succeed in our business.",
        "And, you know, maybe that's the difficulty.",
        "Are the applicants - have they been out of work a long time, or are they changing fields, or what?",
        "There does seem to be a level of which, you know, the folks have been out there longer than we had seen in the past.",
        "And as you look ahead to sustain growth, obviously, 10 percent a quarter would be great.",
        "That may be hard to do."
