        "Right.",
        "So if we had growth like March going forward, you know, indefinitely - so that's about 216,000 jobs added each month - it would take us probably about eight years until we got to the quote-unquote \"\"full employment\"\" - that is, you know, we made up for all the layoffs that we had during the recession, as well as creating jobs for the new people entering the workforce because they're becoming old enough to work now.",
        "What do you make of some economists who say: Wait a minute.",
        "This is all private-sector growth.",
        "All the people were added in the private sector.",
        "In fact, the employment - the government sector's been laying people off.",
        "So this is really a good sign, and it's a sign that it's beginning to take off.",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "I mean, the fact that we've had 13 months now of private payroll growth certainly indicates that there is some at least tiny sustainability to what has generally been considered a relatively weak recovery.",
        "And it's good that we obviously have employers who are hiring at least a little bit.",
        "The fact that governments are laying off workers, I would say, is not good news.",
        "I mean, I know that there is a movement afoot to shrink the size of the government in general, which would mean, of course, having fewer workers.",
        "But whether or not you think that's a good idea, you know, that's sort of a separate issue.",
        "But having it now is somewhat problematic because when you have these government - state and local governments laying off workers, that means adding more people to the unemployment payrolls and fewer people able to spend paychecks, right.",
        "And so when you have, let's say, a town that lays off its employees, you know, whether they're secretaries or janitors or bus drivers or whoever, those people are no longer able to buy groceries, to, you know, replace the car, to get new furniture or whatever.",
        "And that has ripple effects throughout the private sector, as well, because the dollars that they would be spending, they're not.",
        "And what do you make - when we talked to Art Hicks, he said: Well, yeah, first we expand over time.",
        "Then we hire temp workers.",
        "And now we're hiring permanent workers.",
        "Are a lot of employers in that cycle somewhere, or not even at that beginning cycle yet?",
        "That seems to be what's happening.",
        "And that's sort of the standard process here, that employers will dip a toe in, you know, rather than hiring someone permanently and taking on all of those more intensive costs.",
        "Health care, for one.",
        "Well, health care in particular.",
        "But actually, health care is the one industry that's been growing.",
        "Forget the temps there.",
