        "That's what I've been hearing in terms of Silicon Valley, at least anecdotally.",
        "About maybe six months ago, I did a story where I was looking at the employment trends in high-tech, because that's supposed to be the leading industry of the economy.",
        "You know, that's the industry that's growing, whose services we are exporting overseas, even as, you know, our auto shipments and other manufactured goods fall.",
        "And things were still kind of tough.",
        "The new, you know, superstar graduates of places like Stanford were very much high in demand.",
        "But more experienced, oftentimes older engineers who had been out of college for a while were having a lot of trouble and were being offered contract work, freelance work, were having a lot of trouble getting permanent offers.",
        "But that seems to be changing a little bit as at least those companies see some stability to their profits.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hi, George, you're on the air.",
        "Hi, how are you?",

        "I'm a food and beverage director in Naples, Florida, for a restaurant that does about $4 million a year in annual sales.",
        "And since January 1st, we're up about five-and-a-half percent over last year.",
        "We're a pretty affluent town, but we're very seasonal.",
        "We do about 60 percent of our business for the year in February and March.",
        "And I talked to a lot of GMs around town of other restaurants, and everybody's been bursting at the seams this season.",
        "And it's been a - you know, it's just been a bang-up season for every restaurant in town.",
        "We've had a terrific season."

        "So in the course of that, did you hire a lot more servers and people to help cook all that food?",
        "Well, our workforce is about - we have about 70 employees total, but it's misleading because a lot of them work two days a week here, three days a week there.",
        "There's a lot of part-timers.",
        "That's what leads to so many employees.",
        "But what we've noticed in the five-and-a-half percent increase in revenue - which is a sizable number for us, based on $4 million in sales - it's cost us a lot more money.",
        "It's cost us a lot more to do that extra five-and-a-half percent.",
        "I see.",
        "Food costs are just almost unbearable.",
        "Yeah...",
        "Liquor's up.",

        "I think a lot of economists are worried about commodity prices of all kinds going up.",
        "It's not just because of oil prices.",
        "There's actually more demand for various kinds of food throughout the world, as, you know, developing countries get richer, and they want to eat better food.",
        "Cotton prices are going up, all sorts of commodities - you know, the types of inputs that producers use to make the goods that they sell to consumers.",
        "And, you know, what was interesting about this last call also was that the business is doing well.",
        "It sounds like profits will probably be up, and yet there still sounded like there was a little bit of hesitation to hire, and I think that's pretty widespread.",
        "You know, last year, according to the Commerce Department, corporate profits rose at their fastest pace in about 60 years.",
        "So companies did quite well, at least relative to the year before, when, you know, things weren't great.",
        "So it's - you know, it's from a low base.",
        "But even so, companies were doing very well.",
        "They were making a lot of money.",
        "But they still have been relatively reluctant to hire.",

        "Are oil prices, on their own, going to go up?",
        "Or, you know, is the tragedy in Japan going to cause a lot of supply disruptions?",
        "There are just so many sources of uncertainty going forward, that even though companies seem to be doing well, they seem reluctant to take the plunge and really commit to hiring many more workers.",
        "Another aspect of it that, even six or eight months ago, relatively high-end businesses were doing relatively better than their counterparts who were in the middle of the market or low market.",
        "That makes sense.",
        "You know, you see that with the stock market going up, for example, people who have a lot of investments -which are primarily wealthier people - feel richer, and they're more likely to spend more money.",
        "We have been seeing consumer spending going up, and that's probably - although I'm not certain - because of more affluent consumers who would, you know, primarily be shopping at more luxury good-oriented stores, as opposed to kind of the dollar store and the discount stores that actually have been doing relatively well during the recession.",
        "We're talking about the employment outlook as the last jobs report showed an increase of over 200,000 jobs last month.",
        "And, well, the unemployment rate ticked down one-10th of 1 percent.",
        "That's good.",
        "But economists warn that the recovery is still fragile and not going at a fast enough pace to begin to get back to anywhere near full employment for, well, a good number of years.",
        "Our guest is Catherine Rampell, who's the economics reporter for the Business Day section for The New York Times and writes about economics and edits at the Economix blog."

        "When you have laid off schoolteachers, when you have contractors or other grant recipients like the woman who just called, whose funding is tied to the federal government or even state and local governments - when you have all of those people who are losing money or are losing their jobs, they're not able to shop.",
        "They're not able to pay their bills.",
