        "And we're hearing from international sources, especially from Saudi Arabia, that it is now time to start arming the rebels in Syria.",
        "Is there any indication if they're going to do that?",
        "Of course, Saudi Arabia, not an immediate neighbor of Syria.",
        "It will have to be done in one of these camps, in Jordan or in Turkey, in Iraq or in Lebanon.",
        "Peter Kenyon, first, is there any indication that the Turks are willing to start arming the rebels?",
        "No official indication at all.",
        "There have some WikiLeaks cables that basically add up to some speculation that they might be willing to do that.",
        "Certainly, it is a very long and hard to defend border, mountainous terrains, several hundred miles long.",
        "The possibility for physically doing it if the will were there is certainly there.",
        "The risks for Turkey are very high though.",
        "I mean, the reason they got in big fights with Syria in the 1990s were because the regime in Damascus, angry at Turkish water policies, I believe, had ratcheted up their support for the PKK, these Kurdish separatist militants who are present in Syria, in Northern Iraq and, of course, in southern Turkey.",
        "And so they have to worry about that flaring up if they are seen as a hostile adversary by Damascus.",
        "And there are all kinds of regional implications, many of which involve Iran, Syria's largest ally.",
        "The Euphrates, probably the best-known river that rises in Turkey and flow through part of Syria, but not the only one.",
        "The same question to you then, Kelly McEvers.",
        "In Lebanon, is there any indication that some of the Saudi or outside aid might flow through there, or - as you just came back from Jordan?",
        "We took that question recently directly to the source, you know, the gun runners, the guys who would be providing these weapons and these ammunitions.",
        "And their answer is a pretty resounding no, that up to this point, the talk has been just that, talk.",
        "There's been a lot of, you know, sort of bluster coming from the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia, and also Qatar about - and even, you know, some talk among, you know, U.S.",
        "officials over at least whether or not this was an option.",
        "And I think that the answer, so far, has been no.",
        "That's right, with the Angels.",
        "With the Angels.",
        "And he was never known, Tony, as a great manager.",
        "He's been fired from three jobs, two jobs at least.",
        "And he fell into a wonderful situation in New York.",
        "He had a young team of Jeters and Barney Williams, Mariano Rivera, Posada.",
        "He had a team - a perfect team.",
        "That was -it's like you're playing a bit of risk and you got that Boston hand, and his team was on the rise.",
        "The trickle of weapons has been just that, just a trickle coming in probably more so - more weapons coming in from Lebanon than anywhere else, but still it's not very many.",
        "I mean, what you saw in the Baba Amr neighborhood of Homs that Peter was talking about that fell to the Syrian Army and what you saw in Idlib and probably what you're seeing in Daraa now, is that the rebels simply, I mean, one of the reasons that they pulled back, one of the reasons they lost these areas is they simply ran out of ammunition.",
        "They ran out of guns.",
        "They didn't have enough left to fight with.",
        "So that's been a real issue for the rebels, and they've continued their call, you know, to be armed, but so far no one has answered that call.",
        "And that brings us to the international arena, more directly.",
        "And, Peter Kenyon, in Istanbul we mentioned that U.N.",
        "envoy Kofi Annan was unsuccessful in Syria, yet he continues to sound pretty optimistic.",
        "He does.",
        "And apparently, he's had a response, and there will be some further communications, I'm told.",
        "There is some speculation, nothing confirmed yet, that perhaps these escalated series of assaults - first in Homs and then in Idlib, now in Daraa - might be some kind of a lead up to some kind of ceasefire, at least an easing of the military assault on the theory that he - the Assad regime would want to clean up as much of its adversaries as it can, you know, create the most physical advantage that it can before laying down its weapons, even temporarily.",
        "Now, that is just speculation at this point.",
        "There's been no announcement of anything like that, but that is a possibility.",
        "Kofi Annan is a very experienced diplomat.",
        "He doesn't toss around these phrases lightly, but at this point, we have to wait for some evidence."

        "Kelly McEvers, we've heard that, I have to say, dozens of times from the Syrians in the past year: give us a few more days, a few more weeks.",
        "We'll clear this up, and it'll all be over.",
        "Right.",
        "That's what you hear the activists say.",
        "I mean, they say all of this diplomatic maneuvering, the activists and the opposition groups inside Syria, that this diplomatic maneuvering, what, just buys more time for more killing.",
        "I mean, it is hard to imagine the regime at this point.",
        "The regime basically having the upper hand, you know, being willing to give up - to give any ground.",
        "I mean, we spoke to some analysts today saying that, look, why should the regime enter any kind of ceasefire, or talk about any kind of political transition, when it has gained so, you know, regained so much control, especially from the areas that have been fighting back with arms?",
        "Kelly McEvers, NPR foreign correspondent, with us from Beirut.",
        "Also with us on the phone from Istanbul, Peter Kenyon, NPR foreign correspondent.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And the Arab League is now prepared to go back to the United Nations Security Council with another plan that provides a mechanism under which the president, Bashar al-Assad, could step aside.",
        "The vice president, again, would take control of the country, at least for the time being, until talks could be held with the opposition.",
        "Peter Kenyon, is anybody giving their - any better prospects to this plan the second time around after Russia and China vetoed it the last time?",
        "Well, I think you've touched on the real key.",
        "What kind of benefit of the doubt is Russia giving it, in particular, and, to some extent, China as well?",
        "Sergey Lavrov, the comments in recent days have been pretty much what we've been hearing before that the previous resolutions and presumably this one are unbalanced in Russia's views, primarily because they presume some kind of regime change or presume that Bashar al-Assad would step down from power.",
        "That is unacceptable, so far, to the Russians.",
        "They say that in order to even the playing field now, in their view, the west and the countries that have recognized the SNC, the Syrian National Council, should withdraw that support and everyone should start fresh.",
        "This doesn't seem to be acceptable to the West, of course, so we still seem to have a very wide gap on the diplomatic end of things.",
        "And that is one reason, as Kelly was saying earlier, that the Assad regime really doesn't feel a lot of pressure to capitulate.",
        "It remains to be seen if there is some new arrangement that we haven't been hearing much about in public on the table.",
        "And if that is under serious discussion, then we'll just have to wait for that to play out.",
        "Kelly McEvers, there are also, as you know, proposals for all kinds of unilateral, multilateral actions, humanitarian corridors, safe areas, all the way to intervention and no-fly zones.",
        "None of these would be easy.",
        "We think of the example of Libya.",
        "It took, what, 10 days, two weeks for NATO, led by the United States, to take down the Libyan air defense system.",
        "And, by all accounts, the Syrian system is in a different league.",
        "Right.",
        "I think, you know, for months we heard from Syrian protestors and then from - again from these armed civilians and these defectors.",
        "You know, they thought - the thought was, if we pick up arms and we start fighting back, then at some point, somebody will come in and impose a no-fly zone.",
        "And if that happens, then we'll see mass defections and things will fall as quickly as Libya.",
        "We - it's very clear now that that is not the case.",
        "And one of the many reasons for that is that it's just not as easy in Syria to take out the air defense systems, to establish control of certain areas as it was in Libya.",
        "I mean, and we saw several U.S.",
        "officials testify to this effect in Washington last week, that even in doing something as, you know, seemingly easy as establishing a safe zone or humanitarian corridor would actually take weeks and thousands of ground troops.",
        "This is something that very few countries who align themselves with the Syrian opposition want to get into.",
        "I mean, when you're talking about a kind of intervention that's going to stem the violence that's already on the ground, I think what the fear is, is that anything on the table right now would only create more violence.",
        "And, Peter Kenyon, that creates the specter of either a simmering civil war, a chaotic revolution or, at best, a pariah state whose people cow in fear of the government.",
        "Well, all of those and more.",
        "I mean, it could also have regional implications, which is why as analysts will tell you all day long and all night long, Syria is not Libya.",
        "I mean, you've got Iran involved.",
        "You've got - that brings Hezbollah into play, which brings Israel into play.",
        "I mean, the neighborhood is much more volatile, much more fragile and much easier to disrupt than that part of North Africa where NATO went in with a very thorough bombing campaign."

        "So they - you're saying they won not because of Joe Torre?",
        "And so there are many, many, many innocent reasons why these record matches would fail.",
        "(APPLAUSE)",
        "Right.",
        "As we see your reports coming out of places like Homs, of gruesome massacres, very difficult to verify because it's impossible for us to get in and do the kind of reporting we would need to do to verify these, but, you know, it's hard to make up pictures of children who have been slaughtered.",
        "Now, who killed those children, exactly, and who those children are, it's, again, it's hard to say.",
        "But the reports that we're getting from Homs, and now also from Idlib and Daraa, is that after these neighborhoods are taken with, you know, heavy tank fire and shelling, that pro-government thugs, these militia men known as Shabiha, go into these neighborhoods and go house to house and take revenge against those people who stood against the government.",
