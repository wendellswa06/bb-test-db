        "And all of those things are associated with urban violence.",

        "You address the immediate emergency, and then you kind of work out from there.",

        "I think it's very important that when we identify people, we're not simply identifying them to investigate them, to arrest them and maybe ultimately incarcerate them.",

        "Why should they care?",
        "It is true that in the United States, urban violence is concentrated in certain communities and among certain populations.",
        "And if you're not in those communities and in those populations, you are probably not likely to be directly threatened.",
