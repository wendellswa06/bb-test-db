        "Can you say more about what that means?",
        "The resistance, as it has emerged in the Middle East over the last 20 years, has been the result of elements within populations responding to the presence of foreign troops inside the social fabric of this relatively delicate region.",
        "And so it was the right decision, I believe, to decide to do all we could to empower the indigenous forces of Iraq - and now, increasingly in Syria because we have that chance - for them to be the defeat mechanism.",
        "And I use that term very precisely, the defeat mechanism of Daesh - because if Iraqis defeat Daesh, if Iraqis are able then to stabilize and rescue the liberated populations, if Iraqis are the authors of the restoration of the infrastructure that's been defeated, that's the permanent solution.",
        "The permanent solution doesn't come with large-scale numbers of American or Western maneuver forces in a big ground battle there for weeks, taking hundreds of casualties potentially and then pulling out, having created in essence the kinds of antibodies once again in a region that has sown, in many respects, the instability that we face today.",
        "So it may take longer to empower the indigenous forces to be effective against Daesh.",
        "But they have taken Ramadi.",
        "They have taken Tikrit.",
        "They have taken Baiji.",
        "And when they take it and they stabilize the population and they rescue the population, they are the authors of their success.",
        "And that creates permanence in the outcome that we seek.",
        "I imagine when you left, you had an exit interview, if not with the president himself then with top members of his national security team.",
        "May I ask you to share what you can about the guidance you gave as this threat unfolds, as the administration looks to 2016?",
        "I was clear that beyond dealing with Daesh as an entity in the Middle East, we have to be extraordinarily attentive to the capacity of Daesh to create linkages with other organizations that are equally reprehensible and abhorrent - Boko Haram, for example, in Nigeria, Ansar al-Sharia in Libya, Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis in the Sinai, the breakaway elements of the Taliban.",
        "We have to understand the network that operationalizes the linkage and attack that network relentlessly to disrupt it.",

        "Staying with the beautiful game, NPR's Global Health Correspondent Jason Beaubien says soccer is a sport that unites people like no other game can.",
        "For NPR, I end up traveling all over globe, sometimes to incredibly isolated areas.",
        "And more often than not, when I get to those places, people are kicking around a soccer ball.",
        "It doesn't matter if it's Asia or Africa or Central America - kids make a goal out of something, they throw out a ball and the game is on.",
        "The ball could be a knotted towel or a tennis ball or a tattered leather shell, that's barely holding air.",
        "It's the game that matters, not the ball.",
        "Soccer taps in to some primal human drive.",
        "A team of grown men in Sweden looks a lot like a swarm of school children in Guatemala as they rush towards the goal.",

        "While 90 percent of all private agency adoptions are now open, most public-sector adoptions are closed.",
        "That's because many of those adoptions are arranged for children who have been removed from the birth home for abuse or neglect, and open-type adoptions for these children can be problematic.",
        "But new research shows the trouble of arranging an open adoption may be worth the effort.",

        "The state already has the second highest participation in the country, and voters are allowed to register and vote on Election Day.",
