        "Right.",

        "How would it increase pretrial detention?",
        "So the new law passed in California creates broad new categories of people who will now be presumed to be subjected to pretrial incarceration - so for example, anyone arrested and charged with a robbery or any felony where there was just a threat of violence even if no actual violence took place.",
        "And what kind of factors would the judge consider to make those people remain in jail?",
        "You know, there's a whole industry out there of people who are creating these essentially algorithms that take a bunch of factors into consideration and then pop out a number that tells law enforcement or a judge what risk you are - so an algorithm that would take into consideration past arrests even if there hasn't been a conviction.",
        "We know that communities of color are over-policed and come in contact with the criminal justice system much more frequently.",
        "If you now build an algorithm that gives you a worse score on a risk assessment because you have been arrested before, then that perpetuates racial bias in the criminal justice system.",
        "So if you have a problem with sort of the numerical or computer-generated risk assessments and you also don't like unlimited personal discretion from judges when they assess risk, what would be the program that you would design that could perfectly capture what flight risk a particular defendant poses?",

        "What we're not OK with is the standard that is currently before them that just has general categories like public safety.",
