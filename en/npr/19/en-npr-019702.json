        "The bullet shattered the top half of his skull; and his parents, Christine and Gordon, have been his primary caregivers for the past eight years.",
        "At StoryCorps, they remembered finding out about their son's injury.",
        "I remember hearing the phone ring really, really early in the morning.",
        "It must have been 4, 4:30.",
        "And I saw you white as a sheet, shaking - all over your body - and I just said, is it about Erik?",
        "And you said, yes.",
        "And I said, is he dead?",
        "And you said, no. And I said, is he OK?",

        "Do you remember seeing him for the first time in the hospital?",
        "Yeah.",
        "The first time I saw him, he just looked at peace.",
        "I remember the machines beeping; all these tubes coming out of his nose, his mouth, his brain.",
        "They told us he'd be a vegetable his whole life - wouldn't be able to eat, wouldn't be able to speak.",
        "And prior to him going to Iraq, I had had a conversation with Erik.",
        "He had asked me if anything ever happened to him, to pull the plug.",
        "I understood what you had promised, but I just could not be the one to end his life.",
        "So I pulled the doctor aside and I said, can you show me a piece of paper saying that he's gone, that there's no activity on his brain?",
        "And he looked at me, and he was really quiet.",
        "I said, you know what?",
        "There's no more talking about unplugging.",
        "And at that point, we decided to take him home.",
        "I was scared out of my mind.",
        "I was scared to death of giving the wrong meds.",

        "This, of course, is part of the issue that London is facing based on the last month and the bombings that we've seen.",
        "He plans to ban two Islamic groups as well as bringing new powers to expel and exclude foreign nationalists who incite violence.",
        "Karen, let me ask you, as you look at this, and what many see as the erosion, continued erosion of civil rights, not only there but the possibility here in this country, what's your thought?",
        "Well, I think he's taking all the worst lessons from what the United States did after the terrorist attacks on 9/11, and unfortunately not learning the lessons that we have learned over the last three years.",
        "When you choose to erode civil liberties in a way that isn't really going to help make London or England any safer, and that's the sad reality.",

        "George?",
        "Well, it's a tough balancing act to do.",
        "I mean, obviously he can't just sit there and not do anything, so the key always is trying to balance the issues between liberty and security.",
        "And there's also the possibility that this action will--might just further inflame tensions.",
        "So that's the risk you run, but he had to do something.",
        "Michael Meyers, don't politicians and leaders like Tony Blair really find themselves between a rock and a hard place?",
        "As George suggests, you have to do something, but the catch-22 is whether that something, as Karen has already noted, will, in fact, do something, change things and, of course, you'll be up against civil libertarians who will say that you can't do it.",
        "Well, a lot of politicians, when they find themselves in trouble with the polls, have a panic attack.",

        "Let me turn our attention to another look at civil rights and civil liberties, this time as we look at the makeup, of course, of the Supreme Court, and as people turn their attention to John Roberts, the nominee to fill the vacancy on the court.",
        "In the vetting process and, of course, as the media tends to do, unearth and overturn questions of the past, we are now seeing that Mr. Roberts helped shape the debate of the civil rights groups and organizations and the tone and tenor of civil rights in this country during the 1980s, where he would write memorandum for the Reagan administration talking about the right to oppose new provisions at that time in the Voting Rights Act that had just passed in the House.",
        "We know that he wrote op-ed articles for his then boss, Attorney General William French Smith, circulated talking points as well warning that Congress, by trying to make it easier to prove voting rights violations, was on the verge of creating, quote, \"\"a quota system for electoral politics,\"\" end quote.",
        "Again, so much being made of this man, some suggest a wolf in sheep's clothing because his demeanor is not that of a zealot, yet there are those, George Curry, who suggest that this is a hard-line conservative and that people need to take a real look at him.",
        "There's no question that he's a hard-line conservative.",
        "He, despite his denials, be listed in the directory of the Federalist Society, which is trying to just take over, hijack the whole legal system and has been for a while.",
        "You know, they try to make the argument, `Well, he was doing what he was supposed to do as an employee,' but there are some things extremely troubling about those talking points which you just mentioned a while ago, and for his non-support of the Voting Rights Act and saying it was gonna be a quota system for electoral politics.",
        "You go down and look at his other writing as well, and there are always these kind of disturbing things there, just as people suspected.",
        "Yeah, he's played--it's clear from the papers that he was not just expressing the views of a client, the attorney general, that he was clearly expressing his own views.",
        "The reports are about the angry notes that he's written on newspaper articles, so it wasn't just expressing sort of reasoned memos that he was asked to give.",
        "And it--this is a real pertinent question because the--several of the key and strongest provisions of the Voting Rights Act are set to expire in two years, so there will have to be reauthorization, and we all expect that there will be a constitutional challenge, and his perspective specifically on the Voting Rights Act is important because at this point, not only does it need to be reauthorized, but several intervening Supreme Court decisions, one of them with a 5-4 vote, has severely undermined the current law, and so we're gonna need to strengthen it, and his views on this will have real-life implications three, four years down the road.",
        "Well, point...",
        "I think the other thing is it's not just the voting rights, that his positions on the treatment of immigrant children, his positions on the power of the federal government to act to end discrimination, whether it's based on gender or in one case that he worked on, a disability, those are all questions for fair game, and I think they can't--the administration can't say on the one hand, `Look, that was then, this is now,' and then do what they're doing now, which is saying, `But we won't let you see some of the more current papers that might show his views 10 years down the road.'",
        "Well, the issue is not his views.",
        "The issue is not whether or not he's a conservative.",
        "Sandra Day O'Connor was a conservative.",
        "For me, an issue is not whether he is or was a member of the Federalist Society.",
        "I mean, nothing's wrong with that.",
        "I mean, for me the issue is that during the 1980s, when there was a period of retrenchment on civil rights, the man showed an outright hostility, open contempt for civil rights.",
        "He argued against an expansion of civil rights, the protection of civil rights.",
        "He not only did that, he even suggested that you could strip the courts, the federal courts of their jurisdiction over school busing cases, over school prayer cases.",
        "To strip the federal courts of their jurisdiction means you make the federal courts powerless to hear discrimination complaints, to hear controversies under the federal Constitution.",
        "This is a judicial approach, I suggest, that makes him not a conservative, but makes him a radical, makes him a militant person whose attempts to reverse civil rights gains and protections, and if anybody needs protection of the federal courts and the Constitution, the only reason you can--only way you can get it in a system where the majority is against minority rights, or in a system where the president is hostile to civil rights, the only way you have an avenue for redress and to get correction and remedy is the federal courts.",
        "So if this guy is that kind of a radical, then we must know the record.",
        "We must know his judicial approach as opposed to whether or not he's a conservative.",
