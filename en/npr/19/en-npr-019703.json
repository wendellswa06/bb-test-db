        "Now how can you prove that somebody intended to do something?",
        "I mean, you're right, he's an absolute radical, and I do suggest, however, that being a member of the Federalist Society with an agenda for the courts is a very clear view of what his views are.",

        "It's also important to see who's lined up for him, and when you have groups like Operation Rescue enthusiastically embracing the nomination, you know he's not just any moderate conservative.",
        "And again, this issue of stripping the courts is really important, because Congress just passed a law that would allow the--that would strip the right of the federal courts to look at how immigrants are detained, a very basic issue of what is the power of the state to detain someone indefinitely.",
        "So these are things that the court will be looking at, whoever the new Supreme Court justice is.",

        "He has been suspended for two weeks by the network.",
        "He has apologized.",
        "Of course, the network apologized to its viewers.",

        "No.",
        "What we're seeing on the airwaves today is a lack of standards.",
        "Bob Novak and Jim Carville, the guy he was debating, they have a history of butting heads.",

        "I think it's a problem because this is exactly why the American public is losing its respect for journalists, and that is a very sad, scary way for us to be going, because we rely on journalists to really provide and dig deep and give us thoughtful analysis, and now you just have food fights and mud fights and grownups acting like they're from kindergarten, and that is just going to further lower the discourse that we see on the news today.",
        "Well, I don't call this journalism, Karen, certainly.",
        "In fact, they're gonna give him a time-out as though he's some kind of little kid.",
        "I think what really got under his--underneath his skin is he was gonna be asked about the leak in the Valerie Plame case with the CIA, and he was the first one to report it, and basically been flying under the radar screen while journalists go to jail, and I say--I think they des--he knew in advance that he was gonna have to talk about that, and that was a convenient way for him to get out of it.",
        "Yeah, but if that's exactly why, why is he getting a free pass?",
        "Why are all the other journalists letting him go, when clearly he's at the center of the controversy, and yet so little pressure has been brought to bear on what he knew and when he knew it, and he told it.",
        "Yeah, but he was not under contract to answer that question, and although he knew the question would be asked to him, he was not under contract to answer it, and Bob Novak refused to answer it.",
        "Was not under contract to answer it, Michael Meyers, but the question is, the way he handled it is the question of the day.",
        "But we are out of time to continue the answer to that, so my thanks to Michael Meyers, George Curry and Karen Narasaki.",

        "It's a global organization and that the Taliban is something that essentially they are going to be able to negotiate with, and so they're no longer being sanctioned as one organization.",

        "What we don't know is on the Taliban side how serious they are, because all of their official statements say that they will not negotiate until all foreign troops have left Afghanistan.",
        "Now, it's assumed that there are some Taliban representatives that have been putting out feelers, but their official line hasn't changed.",

        "So, instead of talking about it so much, we decided we're going to do something about it, and we're going to try to resolve this disconnect, this asymmetry.",
        "So, we just decided, you know what?",
        "We're going to spend all our money with black businesses and black professionals, and see if we can make a difference with what's going on in the black community.",
        "The reason we decided to make this pledge public is that we're hoping through our story, and through keeping this discussion about black entrepreneurship and black professionals and black talent alive, that we can inspire other families to make similar commitments, may be not as extreme as ours, but say, you know, I'm going to commit to go to black-owned restaurants for six months, or I'll do the Ebony Experiment for two weeks.",
        "What we're hoping to do is just keep this discussion alive about black business.",
        "Well, I want to get to some specifics about what you did to prepare, John.",
        "So, Maggie has laid out the table.",
        "What did you guys do in order to get ready to do this?",
        "Well, obviously, you know, we had to utilize several resources to try and line up what professionals and what companies we were going to try and use, and that was a challenge in and of itself.",
        "You know, we've utilized resources like the Urban League and, you know, just peers, you know, in our community.",
        "And I think what the Ebony Experiment wants to chronicle, and is chronicling, is some of the challenges that we are currently facing, as well as highlighting and dispelling some of the myths around, you know, how easy it can be to find, you know, services and resources within the African-American community, and also highlighting, you know - you know, I think some of the myths out there may be that from a service perspective, or you know, whatever the case maybe, there may be some things that are lacking.",
        "We want to dispel those myths as well.",

        "But we wanted to at least be able to start of January 1st and hit the ground running.",
        "So, we know we needed a gas station, a grocery store, a dry cleaner, those basics.",
        "And it was pretty tough finding those things, Farai.",
        "We assumed, just because, like I've said, we know tons of folks who, you know, went to great schools and we know there's tons of great black talent out there, that that would be easy to find.",
        "It wasn't.",
        "There is one black-owned grocery store in all of Illinois.",
        "And fortunately, it's only about 18 minutes away, but we found that online.",
        "It actually opened in October of 2008.",
        "It's a wonderful store, Farmer's Best.",
        "The gas station was another challenge.",
        "We had a friend of a friend of a friend who knew a gas-station owner.",
        "We called that friend, and we're connected to the gas-station owner.",
        "But all of the five locations in the Chicago area were very, very inconvenient for us.",
