        "When you think about the way that African-American neighborhoods have changed, and you used to have much more economic diversity within African-American neighborhoods, and now, like so many American neighborhoods, they tend to be, you know, all one income level of people, do you think that has an influence, John?",
        "Well, no doubt about it.",

        "I think before, when the struggle or the platform was more along social and civil lines, you know, that was what was highlighted.",
        "So, you had a broader socioeconomic spectrum within ethnic communities, and now we're not seeing that.",
        "So, you know, your point is well taken and certainly, you know, one of the things that we want to highlight in terms of bridging that gap between the African- American middle class and struggling urban communities.",
        "So, Maggie, when you look ahead, what do you think is going to be the impact of this on not just your family, but on the people who are directly in your life, your friends, your extended family?",

        "There was a grounding of the DC-10 in the 1970s after an engine fell off in Chicago.",
        "And more recently in 2013, we had a grounding of Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner as a result of battery fires on that plane.",

        "The de Havilland Comet case we've mentioned from the 1950s, they brought it back.",
        "They had another accident.",
        "They had to ground it again.",

        "You do a time out.",
        "You come up with new safety systems.",
        "And then you reintroduce the plane.",

        "Looking back to that time or other periods when planes have been grounded, how did they affect the airlines or the traveling public?",
        "I think the 787 grounding is actually a good lesson.",

        "Now, there are people on both sides of this argument.",

        "It's a really fascinating story, and it's told in the new book \"\"The Big Roads: The Untold Story of the Engineers, Visionaries, and Trailblazers Who Created the American Highways.\"\" Earl Swift is the author, and he is here.",
