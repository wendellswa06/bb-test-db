        "Right.",
        "Well, I'm going to quote from a page in your book where you put that all to rest, and you say the Federal Highway Act of 1921, signed into law in November, was the foundation for modern highway-building in the U.S.",
        "It remains the single most important piece of legislation in the creation of a national network, far more so than the later Interstate Highway Bill, which would not have been possible or necessary without it.",
        "Wow.",
        "True, yeah.",
        "1921 is really when we got modern, the modern partnership between the federal government and the states that enabled the country to build the network of highways we have today.",
        "You mean the states were building their own roads, and the government was not involved on the state level?",
        "The government was involved, but it was not - there was no coordination built into the planning between states.",
        "So you had states and federal government sharing the expense of building highways, but you had no overall plan for how these things would link up into a network that made sense.",
        "There was no rational, you know, vision for the thing.",
        "The 1921 act changed that.",
        "And you talked about some of the visionaries, about that when Eisenhower got into office, there was a plan that had been well thought out, and the whole highway system put on paper already, and he didn't even know about it.",
        "China is going green.",
        "China's President Hu Jintao told the U.N.",
        "General Assembly that last week and outlined his country's plan to fight global climate change.",
        "He smiles and runs a hand over his head.",
        "After an IED blast, the 40- year-old former Army gunner says he has a mild traumatic brain injury and a PTSD diagnosis.",
        "It was like I was back in Iraq again.",
        "Just I was up at night, and I would sleep during the day, and crying spells.",
        "And, you know, like oh, wait, what's going on?",
        "I'm crying.",

        "But then, a few months ago, something in his life changed."

        "They have to reconcile two vastly different bills in terms of what's stimulus versus what's tax credits or tax cuts.",
        "I think what you will hear later as this process continue is that the House will insist that some of the money for school reconstruction be put back in.",
        "The Senate will insist that the tax credits that they have provided to homeowners and car buyers be retained.",
        "And at the end of the day, we will have a compromise.",

        "This had already been authorized by Congress.",
        "We had an interstate highways system already approved, already on, you know, on the books.",

        "Welcome to our program.",
        "That price tag, by the way, for the school construction is $16 billion.",
        "Well, Ron, you know, save for three Republican senators who backed the package, the vote on the bill so far has been quite partisan, and the senators who joined the Democrats - Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins and Arlen Specter - are catching a great deal of heat from their partisan GOP colleagues.",
        "Can this partisan gap be closed?",
        "Well, I think the partisan gap can be closed, Tony.",
        "But I think what led to the gap and this void in the first place was the inability of the Republicans and the House of Representatives and also in the Senate, to a great deal, to have any impact on the process.",
        "Particularly in the House, the speaker decided that she was going to pass the stimulus package, and she was not that interested in reaching out to Republicans.",
        "We had a 40-year wish list, if you will, of some pork(ph) projects that were included in the bill.",
        "I think the three senators that you mentioned - Snowe, Collins and Specter - are catching a lot of grief because I think if the Republicans had held firm, they would have had a better position to negotiate not only with their colleagues in the Senate, but with the president to try to really bring down the cost of this stimulus package.",
        "I'm all in favor and many conservatives are all in favor of stimulating the economy and using the government to prime the pump.",
        "The question that many people have and I have is how can you demonstrate to me that if you spend this amount of money that it's going to create a certain amount of jobs?",
        "I think there's a certain level of vagueness, and I think that we hear a lot of promises that if we get this bill passed that we're going to have all these new jobs.",
        "I want to see the specifics.",
        "I don't want to see the taxpayers get ripped off once again.",
        "Well, what about the states?",
        "Donna, the governors are struggling to balance their budgets, and they want more spending, even GOP governors like Arnold Schwarzenegger in California and Florida's Charlie Crist.",
        "Should lawmakers be placing more focus on what the states' needs are as part of this?",
        "You know, when I mentioned 15 million, perhaps I should have said that all of these numbers are still under review.",
        "But let me say two things.",
        "One, the Republicans have not offered any alternative new vision.",
        "When they sat on three committees during the House deliberations, they offered amendments, they offered amendments on the floor.",
        "It was more of the same - more of the same that got us into this mess in the first place.",
        "Fiscal irresponsibility that led this president to inherit a soaring deficit as well as a recession."
