        "Governor Schwarzenegger, Governor Crist and many other governors are facing a huge budget shortfall.",
        "As you well know, state budgets must be reconciled before the end of their fiscal year.",
        "These governors are requesting the money because they're having to make some tough decisions as it relates to education, health care for the poor, and they need - they need help from Washington.",
        "Banks are not lending.",
        "They are having a hard time selling their bonds - municipal bonds and state bonds.",
        "So this is a critical piece of legislation at a time when over 20,000 people are losing their jobs each and every day.",
        "Now you and Ron have both articulated the various positions of your respective parties quite well, and it's perhaps because there is a disagreement there that the president took his case directly to the people.",
        "He held a news - his first primetime news conference on Monday night.",
        "(Soundbite of news conference)",
        "Last month, our economy lost 598,000 jobs, which is nearly the equivalent of losing every single job in the state of Maine.",
        "And if there's anyone out there who still doesn't believe this constitutes a full-blown crisis, I suggest speaking to one of the millions of Americans whose lives have been turned upside down because they don't know where their next paycheck is coming from.",
        "And that is why the single most important part of this economic recovery and reinvestment plan is the fact that it will save or create up to four million jobs because that's what America needs most right now.",
        "Now Ron, according to polls by the Pew Research Center and others, 51 percent of Americans do support the stimulus.",
        "That's still a majority.",
        "However, that's down six percent from January.",
        "So is the public waffling on this?",
        "I don't think the public is waffling.",
        "I think the more the public hears about this so-called stimulus bill, the more reasons they have to be skeptical.",
        "We just heard the president say a moment ago that his plan was going to save or create four million jobs.",
        "Give me a clear and coherent explanation how the government is going to create or save four million jobs.",
        "Jobs are created in the public sector.",
        "The government is not in the business of creating jobs.",
        "It's just a fact.",
        "And the other thing that I find fault with and I think that it's indicative in the polls is that the Congressional budget office and the Committee on Joint Taxation up on Capitol Hill both have said they cannot point to where a single job would be identified.",
        "I'm all in favor spending money and putting good money after good causes, but the president needs to do a far better job of articulating exactly how spending $1 here, $1 there will add up to a job being created or saved.",
        "You know...",
        "Well - go ahead, Donna.",
        "It's easy for me as someone who knows how the government work - Ron, and you know as well - when a state receive federal grant money for particular construction projects, they normally go to the private sector to bid.",
        "So these jobs, 75 percent of the jobs that will be created, whether it's infrastructure or even some of the school construction money, will be bidded out at the state and local levels.",
        "So 75 percent will be directed toward the private sector.",
        "That's why the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers are supporting this bill.",
        "They are not your traditional liberal, you know, supporters."

        "What about the issue of the devil being in the details?",
        "And I'm thinking now particularly about Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner whose proposal for the remaining $350 billion in bank bailout funds, known as TARP, sort of fell short.",
        "Wall Street did not respond well to the plan, and the criticism of it was that it simply was not clear enough.",
        "So the question - and I'll direct this to you, Donna, briefly and then let Ron respond - should it have been more precise?",
        "Would that have simply provided more opportunity for attacks on the plan before it could have been put in place?",

        "I think if you'd put Donna and I in a room together for about an hour, we would have had a lot more specificity in details than the treasury secretary did.",
