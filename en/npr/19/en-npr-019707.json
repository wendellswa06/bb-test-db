        "He had signed the act that had financed it.",
        "What he wasn't aware of when he ran into that traffic jam in suburban D.C.",
        "was that the interstate highway system that he conceived of, that he thought he was signing into law, was very different from the interstate highway system that had actually been planned back in the '30s and '40s and authorized by Congress.",

        "And this book is so chock-full of little anecdotes and stories and stuff.",
        "It's hard to know where to begin.",
        "Let me begin or continue by asking you: Who would be considered then the great father of our superhighway system?",
        "Who would you credit?",
        "I know you talk a lot about Thomas McDonald(ph) as being...",
        "Thomas McDonald would probably get my vote as the first among equals of the triumvirate of men (unintelligible).",

        "highway system that dates to the mid-'20s.",
        "Those evolved from a very primitive network of mostly dirt auto trails that we had throughout the teens and early '20s.",
        "It really started, for my - for the purpose of coming up with a line that makes sense with a guy named Carl Fisher(ph), I think - he was an Indiana wild man and speed demon, a bicycle racer, auto dealer.",
        "He marketed the first practical automotive headlight, which made him a millionaire, and he built the Indianapolis Motor Speedway with his winnings and then singlehandedly, pretty much, built the city of Miami Beach and along the way convinced a bunch of his automotive buddies to finance a rock highway from New York to San Francisco, the Lincoln Highway, which they did in fact build.",
        "And that effort inspired businessmen in other cities to get behind private-sector road building as well, and that's how we got this primitive network of auto trails that sprung up in the late teens.",
        "McDonald came in as the head of the federal road-building effort in 1919, a job he kept for 34 years.",
        "He finally retired in 1953.",
        "And he turned that primitive network that Fisher and company had conceived into a rational numbered network, a real grid that made some sense, and then conducted, oversaw the research in the '20s and '30s that spawned the interstate system and rode herd on the proposal that became the rough blueprint for the interstate system.",
        "And then his protege, a guy named Frank Turner, turned that vision into the concrete and steel that started to sprout around the country in the '60s and '70s.",
        "Those three."

        "Yeah.",
        "And then they had to come up with a numbering system.",
        "That's fascinating how you describe how they decided how to number the highway.",
        "Well, they did, because back in the days of the auto trails, the long-distance roads in America all had names, like the Lee Highway, the Lincoln, the Arrowhead Trail.",
        "And they identified themselves - if you were a driver, you knew when you were on a - on the road you were on because it had a signature color scheme, and they painted that color scheme in rings on telephone poles.",
        "And, you know, they literally blazed the trail that you followed.",
        "But after a while, it became so unwieldy because you had multiple trails overlapping - you had 250 trails around the country, 64 in Iowa alone - and you couldn't keep track of where you were.",
        "I mean, the telephone poles were painted from ground to 15 feet up, and trying to figure out one color scheme from the next became a dangerous distraction.",
        "So the feds and the state stepped in and decided to take the private auto trails, the associations that promoted these trails, out of the road-building business.",
        "And they came up - they assigned a committee to come up with a numbering scheme.",
        "And a guy named E.W.",
        "James probably deserves the most credit for coming up with the scheme they devised in 1926, which was that all north-south highways would be numbered with odd numbers.",
        "All east-west highways would have even numbers.",
        "And the lowest numbers of each would be in the far northeast corner of the country, up in Maine.",
        "So numbers would increase as you went west and south, and it had the advantage not only of being expandable - you know, you could always add more numbers to the system as you built new highways - but it also allowed a motorist to figure out where he was based on an intersection between these, you know, two of these highways.",
        "He could roughly kind of pinpoint - you could triangulate your position in the lower 48.",
        "The interstate system took that same idea and just used a mirror image of it – again, odd numbers are north-south, even numbers east-west.",
        "But the lowest numbers are down in San Diego, and they increase in number as you go east and north.",
        "And then you have the triple digits, which showed there was like a spur, like if you had 95, 195 led into that.",
        "On a three-digit number, the first number, if it's an odd number, denotes a spur.",
        "It means that it connects with the main highway only in one point.",
        "An even number means that it's a loop and that it connects in two places.",
        "And that gave rise to the Beltway."

        "And then he turned around, changed his mind.",
        "Mumford is a very interesting guy because he did a complete 180.",
        "He - in the summer of 1931, he co-authored a piece in Harper's with a friend of his named Benton MacKaye, in which they advocated what we would now consider a limited-access, high-speed expressway.",
        "There were none of them in the country at the time.",
        "So this was pretty theoretical stuff that they were advocating.",
        "But they described in this piece, you know, the modern interstate experience, pretty much, with great separated intersections, with development and access to the highway only at certain points.",
        "And you know, he - the interesting thing here is that MacKaye, his co-author in this, was also the guy who proposed the Appalachian Trail a few years ago, or a few years before that.",
        "I did.",
        "Over the course of the next 25 years, after this story appears - and they were - there were a number of thinkers who were, you know, kind of dovetailing on this idea of limited access at the time, but over the next 25 years, Mumford completely shifted his thinking on highways.",
        "And as you say, it was especially when he saw the collateral damage caused by trying to ramrod a, you know, 200, 300 foot road right-of-way through a densely settled older city, especially in the east...",
        "And in the poorest neighborhoods he to try to get - and people...",
        "Most often.",
        "But, you know, in the case of some road projects, weren't real picky about what kind of neighborhood they blasted through, and that caused Mumford a great deal of heartache, as did his realization over time that building more roads didn't alleviate traffic congestion, it just created more congestion on newer roads."

        "And Abrams was able to do that by just pointing out that after putting together 50,000-some-odd batches of concrete, he was able to say that the only thing that really determines the strength of concrete is that you use as little water as you possibly can in mixing it."
