        "Macadam is just, it's gravel of various types, various sizes.",
        "Usually you lay down big gravel, and then you lay down little gravel on top of it.",
        "You roll it, and voila, you have a macadam road.",
        "And it dates from the 1820s, 1830s and takes its name from a guy, John McAdam, who developed the process.",
        "And really what American engineers brought to it was adding either tar or asphalt to the macadam to create bituminous macadam, and that's what we now know as blacktop.",
        "Or tarmac, tar and macadam.",

        "But in fact the Air Force would have loved to have seen that, I think.",
        "And they approached the Bureau of Public Roads about having a look to see whether it was possible to incorporate an emergency runway system into the interstates.",

        "I mean, they were - when they were opened, nobody in Germany had a car.",
        "The only people using them were trucks full of soldiers and tanks, and that was amply clear to all of the American highway officials who went over to take a look at them.",
        "They admired their construction and design, but to a one, they came away concluding that something like that wouldn't have a lot of utility in the United States because, you know, it was designed to move the German army to the country's frontier so they could wage war on their neighbors and pretty clearly designed to do that.",

        "This - the 47,000-mile system constitutes 1.2 percent of our highway mileage, and it carries 25 percent of our traffic.",

        "What we'll see happen if isn't forthcoming to fix it is the bridges will be downgraded in what they can carry, and they'll become far less useful, and eventually you'll see stretches of the highway subjected to the same constraints.",
        "They'll close them?",
        "They will limit the amount of weight they can carry.",
        "So trucks, heavy trucks won't be able to go on them.",

        "The British invasion hadn't started yet, nor had corporate America scorched musical innovation by giving our best musical minds two options - either squeeze yourself into some marketal niche-like easy listening or go cut a record for a label that won't market you and can bail you forward to get you into the stores.",
        "I came of age when radio stations for free actually programmed for diverse musical taste, when record shops were independently owned and would advertise their latest sounds through loud speakers set right out on the sidewalk.",
        "If you wanted to pick up a copy of Max Roach's classic \"\"We Insist: Freedom Now Suite,\"\" you wouldn't have to explain to the salesclerk how to spell his name then wait a week because the record's out of stock.",
