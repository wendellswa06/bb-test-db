        "More and more people are driving cars than in the past.",
        "What is China doing to get past that surge?",
        "China is taking steps through policy tools, investment and subsidies for clean tech.",
        "It could become the largest clean tech market in the world.",
        "There was a new study that just came out by a group of 80 leading technology companies and entrepreneurs from around the world, and it found that China's clean tech market could be worth as much as $500 billion to $1 trillion a year by 2013.",
        "This shift to new energy technology, it's been likened to something as having the fervor of a new space race toward the next what will be industrial revolution.",
        "Is China pulling ahead in this race?",
        "I would not compare the development of a green tech market in China to a space race, because green tech is not an area where one country wins and another loses.",
        "It's an area where development of a clean tech market benefits everybody.",
        "President Obama has been criticized by environmentalists for not doing enough with regard to climate change.",
        "China was also criticized, but they seem to be acting more quickly than the United States.",
        "I just want to bring up a New York Times opinion page piece that was written by Thomas Freedman.",

        "Is China in a position to implement difficult environmental decisions quickly?",
        "To some extent, China is more able than the United States to set ambitious targets for things like renewable energy.",
        "But I would say in the last eight to ten years in the United States, there has been a tremendous amount of path-breaking work going on at the state level, particularly in California.",
        "And some of the policies that California has put into place, such as its very ambitious solar energy incentives have become the model for China.",

        "Instead, they said our goal is to electrify the country.",

        "But let's not put it out of mind.",
        "What conclusions did the ministers reach on Afghanistan?",
        "Well, the idea was that the Afghan issue should be addressed in the context of the entire region.",
        "So the foreign ministers of both Afghanistan and Pakistan were here.",
        "In their joint statement, the ministers complained that in Afghanistan insecurity and widespread corruption continue to obstruct delivery of basic services, including health, education and water."

        "I think the first 45 minutes of the debate, Senator Obama was on the defensive, ranging from his association with a - what I believe to be a former terrorist - the Weather Underground - organization to looking at his comments about people clinging to their guns and their religion due to their bitterness in Pennsylvania.",
        "Senator Obama had to confront, since we haven't had a primary in about a month, or a caucus, he had to confront many of the issues that are driving his numbers down and are causing a lot of people to take a second look at him.",

        "Do you think that Senator Obama held up - I mean, Ron said there was no lasting damage, but do you think that he was on the ropes a bit last night, Mary?",
