        "Senator Obama, I think, tried to play it a little bit too cute last night by not directly answering the question.",
        "And again, the Republicans have got the TiVo going now.",
        "Every time that Senator Obama's on the stage, be it in a debate or be it giving a speech, we're listening to what he's saying, and we're filing that away for the general election, which I think is going to be - should he get the nomination - a very, very difficult road for him to victory because of his equivocations on answers such as affirmative action.",
        "Well, I want to ask both of you to stay with us, and we're speaking to Mary Frances Berry, professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania, Ron Christie, vice president of the lobbying group D.C.",

        "I am going to jump right back in.",
        "Got a couple of last questions on this whole debate issue.",
        "Senator Clinton - you know, guns have been a big issue, and Senator Clinton gave her thoughts on how she would deal with the polarizing issue of gun ownership.",
        "I respect the Second Amendment.",
        "I respect the rights of lawful gun owners to own guns, to use their guns, but I also believe that most lawful gun owners whom I have spoken with for many years across our country also want to be sure that we keep those guns out of the wrong hands.",
        "And as president, I will work to try to bridge this divide.",
        "Mary, do you think that this is the answer folks wanted to hear?",
        "I don't know whether they wanted to hear it or not, but she and Obama parsed that question very delicately because the Democratic Party's been trying to run away from the guns issue for a number of years, since people think it lost an election for Gore, perhaps, or Kerry, or a lot of things lost elections.",
        "So I think it was a nicely parsed answer.",
        "I think Obama also gave a nicely parsed answer on the question.",
        "It's a tough question, but again, they were trying to stay right in the middle."

        "Well, as it relates to Pennsylvania, I think that the longer focus that you have with Senator Obama and Senator Clinton talking about religion, talking about guns and the Second Amendment, that does them a lot of harm.",
        "But I genuinely believe that the issues that will alienate the independent voter, the voter who's looking at both of them and saying, am I going to swing my vote over to these two, is the abortion issue.",
        "Pennsylvania still remains a very blue-collar state in many of the communities across the commonwealth.",
        "And abortion is a very key issue for a lot of these constituents, and they don't like what they're hearing from either candidate.",
        "So I would look at those three as we handicap the Pennsylvania primary, coming up in a little less than a week, as issues that voters are going to take a serious look at And say, does Senator Clinton or Senator Obama represent where I come from and what I believe in?",
        "Well, I don't agree with that, Farai.",
        "I think that the answers they've both given on the campaign trail to that issue, which is that we support choice and they do it in stumbling kinds of ways, but we also want to try to limit the number of abortions, is - and I haven't seen any evidence that that issues is outcome-determinative among the voters.",
        "I think it is going to be the economic issues.",
        "I think it's going to be that their proposals are better than the proposals that the Republicans are making.",
        "And I want to hasten to add something else, just stick it in here.",

        "Now, the Democrats are suing, alleging that Senator McCain may have violated some provision here or some provision there.",
        "But what I find more interesting with this story, if this gains traction, I think the lens is going to be turned back on Senator Obama, who is shattering every fundraising record that seems to be out there, both on the internet and through traditional means.",
        "And I think the focus will go back on Senator Obama and say, well, you made a pledge for public financing.",
        "Why are you now taking private money and eschewing the promise that you made?",

        "Mary, let's - go ahead.",
        "In the media discussion, it may go the way that Ron says, but nothing is going to happen to this issue with McCain at the FEC.",
        "The FEC doesn't have enough commissioners to even vote, and there's no hope of getting any.",
        "They don't even have a quorum, and the lawyers say it'll take three years before they ever sort all this out.",
        "By then, the election will be long over.",
