        "Let's take a quick tour of some international politics.",
        "Pope Benedict XVI is in D.C., his first visit to the U.S.",
        "since he made Pope.",
        "He spent yesterday visiting the White House and President Bush.",
        "How significant is this visit?",
        "Americans have not had much of a chance to get to know this Pope, but there was controversy about his background, his political affiliations in the past.",
        "He's now making a lot of apologies for the sex scandals that have plagued the Church.",
        "What role do visits like these have, Mary?",
        "They inspire the faithful.",
        "They're good shows.",
        "I knew Pope John, and he was an engaging personality.",
        "I first met him when he came here during the Carter administration and then had occasion to meet with him in Rome several times after that about the Haitian refugees.",
        "He was a different - very warm, engaging guy.",
        "This guy, he's a Pope.",
        "He's got all the ruffles and flourishes.",
        "He's rather conservative.",
        "He doesn't speak, really, to the social issues that people are concerned about, and he really hasn't said anything about all those bishops who tolerated all those abuse - the child-abuse scandals that went on in the Church.",
        "How did you end up in Memphis?",
        "But it's good.",
        "It inspires the faithful.",
        "It makes a show.",
        "Everybody gets, you know, to touch him or see him, and so it should give a lift to people who are devout in that way and who like this kind of show.",
        "I think it's great.",
        "Is there really any international ramification?",
        "I mean, you know, the Catholic Church has tremendous influence in nations ranging from Nigeria to Mexico, all over the world.",
        "So is this, essentially, like receiving a head of state?",
        "Yes.",
        "I think this is a pivotal visit.",
        "I think that it was a miraculous, beautiful day where we saw the President of the United States sitting with Pope Benedict, and when they played \"\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic,\"\" the symbolism, the beauty of that, but looking at a more theological basis, I think it's important.",
        "The Pope will be at Catholic University later this evening, and he'll be talking to administrators and people from the Catholic faith who are involved in education, trying to bring back some of the - what the Pope would call more \"\"secularization\"\" of these colleges and universities and remind them of their faith and their upbringing.",
        "So I do think it's important, Farai, from a head-of-state perspective as well as the theological one, that he's here.",
        "But I think it's great that he's here.",
        "And it's also...",
        "Ron, I've got an issue of theocracy, too.",
        "There's some people who feel that - you know, someone said to me this morning in public transit, why are we treating the Pope like this?",
        "When the head of my church comes, nobody recognizes it.",
        "They don't - you don't have as many members."

        "I want to move on to former President Jimmy Carter.",
        "Ron, Carter is on a swing through Israel and Egypt.",
        "He says he has no intentions of being a negotiator for the U.S., but says someone has to open a dialogue with Hamas leaders.",
        "And let's listen to what he had to say in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC's \"\"This Week.",
        "Former President JIMMY CARTER: I think that it's very important that at least someone meet with Hamas leaders to express their views to ascertain what flexibilities they have, to try to induce them to stop all attacks against innocent civilians in Israel and to cooperate with the Fatah as a group that unites the Palestinians, maybe to get them to agree to a ceasefire.",
        "He's gotten heat for using the word \"\"apartheid\"\" in reference to Israel-Palestine.",
        "What do you make of his trip this time, Ron?",
        "I think it's a disgrace.",
        "This is an absolutely unmitigated disgrace.",
        "A former President of the United States going over to meet with a terrorist, a group that is responsible for killing innocent Israelis, a group that wants to move Israel back to the 1967 border, which is a disgrace because, of course, they want all the Jews out of Jerusalem.",
        "For Jimmy Carter to go over there and to give some sort of legitimacy, some form of recognition to a group that is killing Americans, it's killing Israelis, is a disgraceful act on the behavior of the former President of the United States.",
        "I can't even be any more angry and really outraged by what he's doing than what I just said.",
        "Mary, do you think that the president - former president has a point that you have to negotiate in order to make progress?",
        "Oh, I agree with everything that Ron said about the reprehensible nature of Hamas's policy.",
        "But I also think that Hamas won an election, we keep forgetting that.",
        "The Bush's, Rice asked them to have one over there, the Palestinians, and they won it.",
        "And I think that Jimmy Carter, this is vintage Jimmy Carter.",
        "At this point in his life, he feels this commitment, and that I think that Hamas will have to be included.",
        "But I also think that we ought to be consistent, and people who don't want to meet with Hamas, I wonder why they keep talking about meeting with the president Ahmadinejad from Iran, who just said again yesterday that he felt no regret about what happened to the people who were killed on 9/11.",
        "But that's foolish consistency.",
        "But I think Carter is just being vintage Carter, and probably at this point, he doesn't really care whether anybody agrees with what he does, and that's just the way he is.",
        "But he should not have done it without handling it more delicately than he did, in my opinion.",
        "Ron, briefly, the question then arises, I mean, if Hamas was elected, which it was, democracy may or may not always equal what America wants.",
        "In that case, do you deal with democracy as it is?",
        "Well, I think it's important to have democratic elections.",
        "And Mary's point was absolutely right.",
        "Hamas was elected to represent a certain segment of the people in that particular part of the world.",
        "The overarching point, however, is that we should not as the United States sit down and negotiate with terrorist organizations or terrorists.",
        "We've been consistent in this policy.",
        "We don't talk to Fidel Castro, we really have broken off our diplomatic relations with Hugo Chavez.",
        "We're not cherry-picking our democracy, but instead, we refuse unless these organizations renounce terrorism, renounce violence and are willing to put away their weapons and act in a democratic fashion.",
        "I think that's when you start talking to these people.",
        "Not when they refuse to renounce the reprehensible comments they've made about the state of Israel.",
        "It's just absolutely - and really, really unequivocally...",
        "Well, Ron, Ron.",
