        "Most of the photos on those campaign posters feature male faces.",

        "Why put a number or percentage on how many women should serve on local councils?",
        "Well, this is a recommendation that came out in 1996 by the United Nations, which is really a 40 percent quota for women.",
        "However, we, as women's groups, we lobbied for a 40 percent quota, but we had to bargain it down to 25 percent.",
        "And it is one name of a woman among every three names in every desk.",
        "And it's - any council constitutes less than 25 percent.",
        "Women who are going have to go to court, because it is a constitutional matter.",

        "Why is this happening?",
        "Well, I don't know.",
        "I have met with quite a few women candidates, and I'm going to vote for a woman myself.",
        "There are a number of women who are capable and able of doing the job, and they are very enthusiastic, and they are in the forefront of the elections campaign.",
        "However, some parties and blocks who haven't dealt with women issues before might find it difficult to find women.",
        "So, I mean, they might resort to forcing the wife or sister to run.",
        "I mean, you know, we don't want for this to happen.",
        "Are there differences in how women can or should campaign in Iraq compared to men?",
        "Sometimes, a woman's faith is either the religious or a traditionalist groups, especially within tribal society, and they are not able to put up your pictures or campaign for themselves openly.",
        "I mean, this is a culture that we have to work on.",
        "We look forward to developing the status of women within our country now.",
        "And this is part of its birth.",
        "A woman should be able to take part in the decision-making processes.",

        "Some of us are more liberal than others, but we do agree about the importance of education for women, and importance of our services, job opportunities, etc. Iraq has a big problem of widows, a large number of women who are without anyone to support them, like man, a husband, a brother, etc., sons."

        "The story focused on the high price of the antivenom she got - more than $60,000 for four vials.",
