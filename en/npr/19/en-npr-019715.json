        "As for the snake, rescue workers decided to freeze it.",

        "On one particularly hot June day, with temperatures soaring past 100 degrees in Washington, D.C., Senator Tim Wirth convened a congressional hearing on what was then called the greenhouse effect, summoning several expert witnesses.",

        "Altogether, this evidence represents a very strong case, in my opinion, that the greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate now.",

        "What can happen is you can isolate the venom to that limb.",

        "We had to be careful about how we loosened it up because if you loosen it too fast, you can get venom bolus into the bloodstream.",
        "So we had to gradually loosen it so that the antivenom would meet the venom in the blood.",

        "What did we see, and what's been the reaction?",
        "Not a ton of surprises in this report, which the top lines of this are that the Republican health care bill would, over these 10 years, save some money but would also mean that fewer Americans were insured.",
        "By CBO's estimate, 23 million fewer Americans would have insurance over the next 10 years compared to the current health care law.",
        "The hard part and the hardest part about the CBO score for Republicans is that it reassessed the changes they had made to the bill affecting pre-existing conditions and the coverage requirements under the Affordable Care Act, and essentially said yes, some people in some markets who have pre-existing conditions could be priced out of the marketplace.",
        "And that is a really devastating blow for Republicans.",
        "As we know, they voted on this without waiting for the CBO score.",
        "What's been the reaction to this report?",
        "There's an open question of whether this bill could have passed the House had they known that this is what the CBO was going to say about those pre-existing condition protections because while the Republican Party for the past six or seven years has been unified about the idea of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, they've also campaigned on protecting the popular parts.",
        "And the pre-existing condition protections in the current law are arguably the most popular parts of the health care law.",
        "All right, so what now?",
        "You know, you've got the bill in the Senate, a group of 13 senators working on it.",
        "What do you know about their efforts?",
        "Where is it going?",
        "What's so interesting in the Senate is it's all kind of happening behind closed doors.",
        "These 13 Republican senators were picked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and they're meeting in secret.",
        "So we don't really know what the Senate bill is going to look like.",
        "We do know the time frame.",
        "In order to get this done, because the Senate is using a very special budget mechanism to have this bill, they really need to get it done by the August break.",
        "So we're looking about - the next two months are really the critical action time in the Senate.",
        "And if we don't start to see a bill come together by early July, they're going to be in really rough shape."
