        "It seems there's been a lot of criticism.",
        "Short answer - no. There really is something in there for everybody to dislike.",
        "You know, the act of the president sending up his budget has become sort of one of the greatest political theater acts in Washington.",
        "We know that what the president has asked for is not going to become law.",
        "So the budget is really a statement of priorities and values.",
        "And what was really interesting about President Trump's budget is it wasn't really a reflection of President Trump the candidate.",
        "Right.",
        "It was much more a very traditionally fiscally conservative budget, which is more consistent with perhaps Mick Mulvaney, who is the director of the Office of Management and Budget - a very conservative Republican - not necessarily the Donald Trump on the campaign trail who campaigned on protecting things like Social Security and Medicare and campaigned on spending a lot of money on things like infrastructure projects.",
        "What next, though?",
        "Is it going to be similar to what we saw during the Obama years where the president can ask for whatever he wants but basically Congress does what it wants?",
        "Exactly.",
        "But what Congress has to do - they're going to write their own budgets.",
        "And they need to set their own priorities for the money that the government is going to spend next year.",
        "And what they need to do and why the budget matters this time is that the House and Senate Republicans really want to agree on a joint budget because if they can agree on a joint budget, that will let them create another special budget process to do tax reform.",
        "And tax reform is the other major legislative goal of both the White House and Republicans in Congress.",
        "Where are the Democrats in this budget?",
        "Do they have leverage this time to protect some of the things that they're interested in protecting?",
        "On the budget itself, no Democrat's going to vote for a Republican budget.",
        "But on these spending bills, yeah, there is a lot of room for bipartisanship.",
        "On the actual dollars that get spent, the appropriations bills, the 12 spending bills every year, they are generally passed with bipartisan support.",
        "And Democrats, yes, as the word you said, leverage.",
        "They have leverage to focus on and get some of their priorities because Republicans can't move forward without them."

        "Well, tell us more.",
        "It seems that this budget deficit is increasing every day.",
        "Yeah, the governor's fiscal director said that basically, if you look at the way the stock market has gone, that's pretty much the way the state's finances have gone, and that's obviously down.",
        "California relies tremendously on personal income taxes and capital gains.",
        "Those are just going right into the toilet.",
        "Every month, basically, they've been revising their estimates, and the new estimate is 32 percent worse for this fiscal year, which ends next June.",

        "First of all, the state is a huge part of employment and the economy itself.",
        "I mean, the state has over a $101 billion in spending.",

        "The state next week is going to - California is going to stop spending about $5 billion on its infrastructure projects if there's no resolution, which looks very likely that there won't be.",
        "And that will translate into $12 billion in job losses in the private contracting field.",
        "I think that the Obama administration has recognized they have to do something about all the states in crises because they are basically the equivalent of gigantic employers.",
        "And their crisis is one of the things that's keeping the recession going."

        "Why can't they come to an agreement on this?",
        "Well, the California legislature, you know, puts the dys in dysfunction.",
        "It is just absolutely paralyzed, and the reason is because you've got a very ideologically-polarized legislature, with a lot of liberal Democrats from safe Democratic areas and conservative Republicans from very conservative areas of the state.",
        "And then, on top of that, you've got a set of rules that just make any type of compromise very difficult.",
        "And the toughest one there is that any budget or spending plan has to pass by two-thirds of a vote of both the Senate and the Assembly.",
        "So, even though the Democrats hold pretty firm majorities in both houses, they can't do it without getting three Republican votes from the Senate and three from the Assembly.",
        "So, it basically has to be a consensus budget.",
