        "Thanks for having me.",
        "With so much on the record, what's left to be imagined by a novelist?",
        "Mostly how it felt, I think.",
        "I thought if you were going to do this as a novel, you had to get inside the people who were there.",
        "And so, I tried to tell the story from essentially seven different points of view and see what it felt like.",
        "And I avoid most of the big events that people - they certainly occur.",
        "But I don't tell the story the way you would tell it in nonfiction.",
        "I tell it more as a series of private dramas and try to give certain intimacy.",
        "As you will learn on tour, there are Watergate buffs...",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "...like there are Civil War buffs and jazz buffs who will catch you on the smallest bit of misinformation, or imagined information.",
        "How important was historical accuracy to you?",
        "I refer in the acknowledgements of the book to the always sliding scale of historical fiction.",
        "And I think you really have to make these decisions book-by-book and almost scene-by-scene.",
        "I don't violate any of the big historical moments, dates.",
        "You know, Richard Nixon still resigns at the end of this book.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "It's not what in the historical fiction biz we call alternate history where, you know, the South wins the Civil War and things like that happen.",
        "But within those events, I think there's still plenty of room for a novelist to imagine what might have happened not instead of the real events, but in addition to the real events, and how people might actually have felt about them in a way that's somewhat different from what they put onto the record."

        "Your novel reminds us when the men were arrested and the scandal began, Richard Nixon was at the height of his powers.",
        "Absolutely.",

        "He had a very weak opponent in George McGovern.",

        "And the sheer unnecessariness of the Watergate break-in is something that must have tormented him and his allies in all of the years that followed.",

        "She never married.",
        "She did not give interviews.",
        "She was very private.",
        "Her loyalties to him were extraordinary.",
        "She is most famously associated with the erasure of 18 and a half minutes on one of the tapes that was subpoenaed.",
        "Why, the picture of her, a dignified woman making an undignified stretch, became well-known.",
        "And I think that that must have been tormenting to her.",
        "And I've talked to a couple of people who knew her and they remark on her charm, her wit.",
        "She was a terrific dancer.",
        "I talked to somebody who used to escort her around town, and he said don't finish the book without giving her a chance to dance.",
        "And I tried to imagine what it must have been to feel the personal isolation that she must've been - because she was a single person, essentially by herself, but to be at the red-hot center of this catastrophe that was dragging down somebody that she admired unquestionably.",
        "Yeah.",

        "But a megastar like Beyonce put the typical in the spotlight, and suddenly that build and its amenities were everywhere, splashed across magazine spreads, accented in videos.",
        "In a confused world of multi-cultural soul singers like Christina Aguilera and Mariah, Beyonce was unapologetically and unmistakably black.",
        "Straining more than a bit beneath those glittery evening gowns and designer jeans, her butt was confrontational in the best way and it reassured the rest of us that a figure like that still had a shot at celebrityhood.",
        "Sure, magazines like \"Vogue\" worried a lot at Beyonce's hips - the polite society term for butt - and that the fact that the diva seemed to indulge in fried chicken salads a tad more often than she should.",
        "But I figure Beyonce was used to it by now.",
        "But she was grounded firmly enough in the aesthetics of hip-hop to not worry much about Hollywood.",

        "But Beyonce was different.",
        "She wasn't O' natural bombshell from the beginning whose other dalliances with artifice - blonde hair, extensions - were routine and couldn't begin to neutralize her core appeal as a bodacious black woman with a body and a booty to match.",
        "Now, well, there's not as much hope, literally, because there's not as much Beyonce.",
        "In preparation for her role as the lead (unintelligible) in \"Dreamgirls,\" Beyonce whittled herself down in the last year to end up looking like Halle Berry.",
        "Now, there's nothing wrong with Halle Berry.",
        "She's lovely and all that, and she happens to be petite.",
        "But she also happens to be part of a long tradition of black women that Hollywood and America in general finds acceptable - light skin, well spoken, slender, beautiful but not lusty; think Lena Horn.",
        "But we need more diversity.",
        "We need light-skinned black women who are not exactly slender.",
        "We need black women of all skin shades who have body types and sensibilities that fall somewhere along that long spectrum in between Halle Berry and Mo'nique."
