        "The important issue here in that particular letter was a man writing about his in-laws, and I think this is really important to think about because I'm sure he would have had a different attitude had it been his parents.",
        "He basically felt that his in-laws had more or less frittered away their money and then they had also lost a lot in the market as a lot of retired people have.",
        "And he was now being asked to contribute with other family members to their monthly income.",
        "Right.",
        "And you said, as I understand it, your point was that the son should help the father-in-law.",
        "But you got this response.",

        "But paying ransom for their poor choices is bad advice.",

        "This will probably divide the family.",
        "But again, this is due to their poor planning.",
        "Signed, Irate.",
        "So, did you change your mind about the advice you gave out in the first place on that?",
        "Well, I was happy to run that letter from Irate, as I always am from irate readers.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But the fact is, I, when I answered, I gave a nuanced answer, I thought.",
        "And the gentleman who wrote to me initially, one of his questions was, should I ask my wife to go to work to help support her parents.",
        "The answer?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Absolutely she should.",
        "The in-laws were asking for $300 a month.",

        "As investors, you have a right to ask them to disclose to you exactly what their expenses are.",
        "And so, I like to think I gave this family a plan of action.",
        "But yes, I said I think you do need to step up.",
        "I mean, these are completely unforeseen situations and this couple, as the guy said, was in their 70s.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But what about - where do we draw the line?",
        "I mean, where does it end?",
        "Well, I think one place to draw the line is if it's going to place your own family at risk.",
        "That's a really - it's very important for parents to try and keep their own family's heads above water.",
        "But I do think that we need to, you know, consider what's going on with our elders and do what we can to help.",
        "And actually I loved Irate's suggestion that they take over, for instance, the utility bill.",
        "That's a fantastic suggestion.",
        "All right.",
        "Now, this is a case where you're dealing with parents.",
        "What about other relatives, siblings for example?",
        "When Martha Layne Collins was elected governor of Kentucky, incumbents could not seek re-election, so she did not defeat an incumbent.",
        "Always the threat is there, because we, being, I mean, foreigners through U.S.-based agencies, I think there's always a threat of, I mean, attack from wherever, but for us, IMC has such has very good and cordial relations with the beneficiaries, and we are providing much-needed health service and, therefore, I think we might be the last agencies to be under attack.",
        "Our security is more a danger because of this sudden withdrawal of assistance because of funding issues."

        "Tell us about that and why you think that might strengthen your program.",
        "Yes, I think in this circumstance, where we currently operate with diminishing funders, if you rely on international stuff, which might be expensive, your program might not be sustainable, and so I think working with national people keeps the program running under difficult funding situations, even.",

        "My opinion is that any displaced person could ask for an absentee ballot and vote that way.",
        "This is not such a burden for someone who loves their city.",
        "New Orleans has not moved, and it would be easier for the displaced person to contact the election bureau, than for the election bureau to find each displaced person, some of whom may not even be interested in voting or coming back to the city.",
        "I do believe they could extend the timeframe for mailing in the ballots, but I do not feel it's too much to ask a displaced resident to write a letter and ask for a ballot.",
        "If a citizen really cares about their city, then they will spend 39 cents to get a ballot.",
        "Listener Donald Owens(ph) of Baltimore, Maryland disagrees and thinks the government should do more to help the city's residents vote.",
        "It's just appalling, and it's just so simplistic that we as a country just need to make an issue out of everything, that we don't understand the magnitude of what has happened to those people in New Orleans.",
        "That the Federal Voting Commission would have the audacity to limit the voting the mayor, whether it be the mayor, or the dog catcher, just that those folks left in New Orleans.",
        "It's almost criminal."
