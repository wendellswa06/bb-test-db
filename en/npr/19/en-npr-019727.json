        "But you're saying that you should have this conversation right at the beginning.",
        "You should set limits at the beginning.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And I know that it's very, very hard to do because everyone is in distress.",
        "But if you say, OK, let's try and sit down every Thursday and let's try to keep this not open-ended, but let's plan on this as a finite situation that we can help you through and we will be revisiting it every week to check in and see how it's going.",
        "I love this idea, but I know...",
        "I know.",
        "That some families are good at communicating that way, and others not so much.",
        "For whatever reason, you know, they don't have the nerve to have the conversation at the beginning, and yeah, I think you're probably right, that leads to trouble in the end.",
        "But there is something just too hard about sitting down, having the really frank conversation at the beginning.",
        "I don't know how you can help people with that.",
        "Well, one way is to not think of it as a, you know, frank conversation but as a supportive conversation, where you say, let's talk about - let's try and figure out how this will go so it works well for everyone.",
        "What are the things you can do while you're here, how can we - you know, you have to talk about things like bathroom time.",
        "It's really, really important to lay out some of the mechanics if you're going to be cohabiting with more people.",
        "It's - and look, not everybody can adhere to these agreements that they make, but it's nice to have the conversation - and you don't have to think of it as a confrontation, of course.",

        "Good to have you with us, Nancy.",
        "Hi.",
        "Thank you.",
        "So, we were just talking with Amy about this idea of setting the boundaries early.",
        "When - how do you that in a really positive way so that the person you're dealing with doesn't become resentful of the fact that you're trying to tell them what to do?",
        "They're an adult, they don't want you telling them what to do, those kinds of situations can occur.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, I think - Amy, by the way, I want to say that I love Amy's advice.",
        "I think in her life story also illustrates what we're trying to help patients with right now, which is what we call resiliency.",
        "It's the ability to adapt to difficult situations, which is what we're in now, and to be able to bounce back from stress.",
        "Some people are fortunate in that they are resilient by nature.",
        "They grow up in families that learn, that know how to cope in tough times.",
        "Most people right now are learning it as they go.",
        "This is a skill that can be taught, and part of being resilient is also being flexible and having good communication skills.",
        "And what we're - this is, you know, part of being a good communicator is the ability to, you know, sit down and sit through what - trying to understand what the issue is.",
        "And I think in this case I would, you know, as a psychologist I would try to look at, you know, is this an issue of lack of flexibility, is this an issue of shame or, you know, difficulty with privacy or, you know, what exactly is the issue that's going on here.",
        "I mean, clearly - the other thing we're doing is we're sort of reinventing the notion of family.",
        "Family right now doesn't necessarily mean just your blood relatives, but many people right now during this recession are reaching out to good friends and are moving in with good friends that are - and you know, it's much a broader conversation that we have to think about."
