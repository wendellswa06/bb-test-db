        "And that's why we're seeing so many families in our offices, both extended families, nuclear families, brothers and sisters coming in with the impetus of the recession, but essentially they are issues that they've been simmering for a long time.",
        "But they are psychological issues that sometimes can only be dealt with in the context of a professional therapy kind of setting.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's take another call from Linda(ph), and Linda is calling from Kansas City.",
        "And I do want to remind our other listeners that we are discussing relatives in a recession and how you deal with the situation when your relative needs help.",
        "Sometimes you are able to help them, sometimes you may not be able to - what if you need help.",

        "Hi, Linda.",
        "Hello.",
        "Mine is really a terrible situation, seems have gone from bad to worse and then halfway getting good.",
        "But I was a single mother and raised two children.",
        "My daughter is a physician practicing here in the Kansas City area, and my son is in insurance.",
        "But I lost my job in 2003.",
        "For a while I was able to kind of maintain myself and come back until I lost the next job I got.",
        "My son's father passed away very suddenly, then his grandmother, my son's grandmother on his father's side, she passed away, and then my mother passed away in May of this year.",

        "They've never given me an ounce of support to say, gee, mom, you know, we're sorry this has happened to you - I mean, nothing like that.",
        "Now, I'm about to default on my home, I mean - and they just seem to have no sympathy.",
        "We argue over money and then they end up giving a little here, a little there.",
        "But it's just been so overwhelming for me and I just - I'm just devastated.",
        "Amy, Amy Dickinson, can you respond?",
        "Well, and actually, I think this is a prime example of when your family isn't working and you're in distress, change your family.",
        "Really, reach out to friends, your church community.",
        "A lot of us receive a much better quality support and empathy from people we're not related to.",
        "And your children may have very longstanding issues with you that are just simmering now.",
        "They might be overwhelmed by their own young kids, their own careers, and it's just a shame this is happening to you.",
        "But I love the fact that you're getting help for your depression, it's absolutely vital.",
        "And the next thing you need to do is to find other people who can offer you the sort of community that you need and deserve to have.",

        "My question or comment is, you know, I've been listening to this and, you know, being a Latino and coming from a different culture I'm just amazed at how this can cause this much upheaval.",
        "And it's like the upheaval comes now, and people are trying to deal with it now, but maybe if the culture changed, which now that we have this kind of hardship, maybe it will.",
        "But I was just thinking - nothing, absolutely nothing, it would never - I would never hesitate if my brother or my sister needed to come live in our house, and I just can't imagine thinking for a moment if the world, you know, if the bottom fell out of my life that I would hesitate to call on, you know, my immediate family without a doubt, even my distant family.",
        "I mean, I have...",
        "So, are you saying, Felipe, you think that this is something that is part of the Latino culture that wouldn't be a problem for most Latinos to do, is that what you're saying?",
        "Not just Latinos.",
        "I'm going to go a little further, because although I'm Latino and grew up in this country, we're from Europe, and in all of Europe - I mean, if you visit over there, you know, we don't have this hangup with our space.",
        "We don't live in huge homes and not everybody's got to have their own bedroom.",
        "You know I have two children and I'm fortunate, we live in a very large home, but my boys who are now teenagers share the same room.",
        "And there is a spare room, and they could easily have, you know, separated and we just don't let them, and when they ask why, I say, hey, when something happens to us, all you're going to have in this world is each other.",

        "Nancy, I just want to interrupt you for a second because I have to remind our listeners that you are listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "I'm saying, you know, in certain cultures the norm is to live with extended family members, and to also revere one's elders.",
        "And so, you know, this is - you know, our culture in the, you know, the '50s and '60s, early in the 20th century even, the idea was just sort of form your own strong nuclear family.",
        "And what we're seeing now with this recession, and we kind of talked about this earlier, is that this is a time, in fact, when you need to take a step back and think of your family in a much broader context.",
        "Your family might be brothers and sisters.",
        "It might be the neighbor.",
        "It might be your church members, you know, and going back to the notion of extended families but even broadening it.",
        "And I think that the people who can look at their life in that way, the resources are many and multiple kinds of resources, are doing better than the people who are, you know, have one or two nuclear family members that perhaps, quite frankly, they're not getting along with.",

        "I wanted to mention that it is a good thing to be a good Samaritan when you can and let your family move in if there aren't any extenuating circumstances, but you also need to do your homework.",
        "There are legal obligations that you may have if you let any of your family or friends move in with you.",
        "For instance, in Indiana, if somebody moves in, they so much as hang up a set of clothing in their closet, they need to stay there until you have given them 30 days written notice that they have to leave.",
        "So do the homework before you let somebody move in, or you could really escalate problems with family.",

        "I really don't.",
        "I think it's something you need to talk with your family members, create, you know, reasonable expectations, and if you have to get your Uncle Buddy, you know, evicted, well, burn that bridge when you get to it.",

        "But, you know, I just think it's wonderful living with my parents.",
        "And I agree with the previous caller, I think his name was Felipe, just talking about, you know, there's - so I think there's some problems with our culture and our reliance on the nuclear family and the amount of space that we think we need.",
        "I mean, also just in terms of the environment, these big houses.",

        "Well, Alex, because the government invented this whole new military tribunal system with which to try the terrorist.",
        "We haven't used military tribunal since World War II.",
        "So they're a little bit rusty and to say that specific system of tribunals have been set up for years and years progresses in fits and starts is to overstate it because it's all fits and no starts so far.",
        "The system has been struck down completely by the Supreme Court in 2006 in a case actually that has Hamdan's name on it.",
        "The whole system was then resuscitated later that year by the Congress.",
        "But after all these years there's only been one conviction through the system and that was through a plea bargain.",
        "It was of David Hicks, the Australian Taliban, the kangaroo trapper, who served less than a year sentence in Australia and is now free.",
        "So the system's been kind of a mess, and every time they fix it, arguably, they make it worse.",
        "And how will this trial differ from a regular civilian trial?",
        "Well for one thing today the jury pool is being assembled and it's comprised of 13 people, all of whom are military officers.",
        "But just in general, in addition to it being run by the military and prosecuted by the military and judged by the military, there's also an issue of just enormous deference to the prosecution and the prosecution side of the story.",
        "And rules of evidence that are much, much, much more generous that you'd ever see in a civilian trial.",
        "For instance, heresy evidence is allowed into this trial against Hamdan and even evidence obtained by means of quote \"\"cruel\"\" and quote \"\"inhuman interrogations\"\" will be admissible.",
        "So much, much, much harder fight for Hamdan than he would be finding in a criminal trial.",
        "Earlier today he plead not guilty.",
        "Even if he is acquitted he likely won't be released?",
        "What will happen to him?",
        "Well this is because the Bush administration can still call him an enemy combatant even if he is innocent of the charges.",
        "The specific charges of which he's been accused and in fact only a handful of the people at Guantanamo who are called enemy combatants are even going to face these military trials.",
        "So the vast majority of them will just be held there presumably, says the administration, until the end of hostilities.",
        "Now there's an even more interesting question which is everybody is telegraphing that they want to close Guantanamo which raises the possibility that we're going to hold Hamdan and everyone else at Guantanamo till the end of hostilities, whenever that may be, but not at Guantanamo.",
        "It's going to be very difficult to send him back to Yemen.",
        "The administration says they don't feel reassured that even if he's acquitted that the Yeminis can keep us safe from him again.",
        "And so a real question is whether he's then going to be held for the rest of life whether or not he's found innocent or guilty."
