        "Hi.",
        "I actually came a little bit late to Tuesdays with Dorie because I had discovered her through her cookbook \"\"Around My French Table,\"\" and had used it to prepare dinner for several friends for my 40th birthday.",
        "So I did a five-course dinner using nothing but Dorie's recipes.",

        "But they were so well-written, they all turned out really well, and I had a great birthday because of it.",

        "And...",
        "What...",
        "...I love your cookbook so much that I give it to all of my friends as gifts now.",
        "What was the star of the evening?",
        "I would have to say, probably - I'm not going to try the French pronunciation, but the beef on a string recipe was the main entree.",
        "That was pretty popular.",
        "Oh, (foreign language spoken).",
        "That's a dish I - we always have a New Year's Eve party in Paris, and that's a dish that I often make for it because you can make it ahead.",
        "And you can make it for four people, or you can make it for 20 people.",
        "And it's always delicious, and it has vegetables in it, and I always think the French should eat more vegetable.",
        "So that's my little..."
