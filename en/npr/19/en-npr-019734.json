        "But it sill will pose a danger in terms of our policies, because on one hand, Iran is on the verge of building a nuclear facility, along with North Korea, and this decision may come back to haunt the United States in the future.",

        "And so the fact is is that India has said look, Mr. President, look United States we will work with you albeit somewhat cautiously, to open up some of our nuclear reactors, to discuss exactly what we can and cannot do.",

        "And so I think what you're seeing is a natural reaction from the American people by saying, look, Mr. President, you campaigned in 2004 as strong and steady leader that's not going to flip flop, that you know exactly where you're going.",
        "And I think what you're seeing now is the American people scratching their heads and say, well, wait a minute.",

        "And the American people are hearing that and are saying, first, of all not only are they contradicting themselves, number one, but also number two, who is the leader, or who is the rightful leader of the Democratic Party.",
        "And you have to give the Republican credit that naturally because the Republicans obviously controls the house and the Senate and the White House, the president by default is our leader."
