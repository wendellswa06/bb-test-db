        "If the White House does this, it'll be manipulating the Military Lending Act regulations at the behest of auto dealers and banks to try and make it easier to sell overpriced rip-off products to military service members.",

        "No.",

        "So when you drive a new car off the lot, I mean, everybody kind of knows that it loses some value right away.",
        "And car dealers - if you've ever bought a new car, been lucky enough to do that - they'll say, hey, you know, if you crash and total your car, you could be out a pile of money, and that's because your insurance might not cover what you owe on your car loan.",
        "There's this gap, you know, between what you might have borrowed and what the car is now actually worth.",
        "And there's this insurance policy to cover that.",
        "It's called gap insurance.",
        "Here's Peterson again.",
        "Car dealers push it so much and they scare people so to convince people they got to have this gap insurance.",
        "The thing is, though, Peterson says you can get that kind of insurance for very little money if you call up your regular insurance company.",
        "It's, like, $20 or $30 over the whole course of a year.",
        "But some car dealers will charge way more.",
        "Peterson says he's seen, like, 1,500 bucks over the course of the loan.",
        "He says it can be, like, this very predatory product.",
        "All right.",
        "I'm sure that car dealers are defending themselves.",
        "What do they have to say about this?",
        "Right.",
        "They have a different view.",
        "They say this is a valuable product and it should be available to everyone.",
        "Paul Metrey is with the National Automobile Dealers Association.",
        "Service members certainly should have the same access to credit protection that their civilian counterparts have.",
        "And now when they engage in these transactions, this valuable gap product is effectively not available to them."

        "The thing is, though, that active-duty military personnel are not civilians, and they get some special protections under the law.",
        "And Peterson says, look; you know, service members can still get this kind of insurance, often more cheaply, if they go elsewhere.",
        "And in this latest draft of the proposal, though, the White House appears willing to do what the industry wants.",
        "This has gone back over to the Department of the Defense now, and the department there is saying, look; this is not a done deal; if we do anything, we just want to make sure that it doesn't hurt service members or their families.",
        "Well, you've been doing some broader reporting on this law, and it sounds like what you've sort of discovered is that the consumer protection bureau might be rethinking the whole law and how it's enforced, yeah?",
