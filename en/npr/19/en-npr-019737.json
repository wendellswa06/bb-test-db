        "Well, I'll give you 777 reasons, and that was the stock market that went down on Monday.",

        "But why did it fail in the first place?",

        "It only failed by, as you say, 12 votes, and like 64 Democrats voted against it.",
        "Could they have peeled off 12 Democrats to vote for it?",
        "Probably, but the Democrats said from the beginning they did not want to be the ones to vote to pass the package because according to them, it's the Republicans' fault.",
        "So the Democrats didn't want to pass the package and then the Republicans could go and campaign against the Democrats and the bailout.",
        "So in other words, the Democrats thought they needed about 80 Republicans to make it look like they had political cover.",
        "Right, and they didn't get that.",
