        "He's very, very popular, very successful governor - mayor of New York, I'm sorry.",
        "Predecessors Rudy Giuliani and Ed Koch both endorsed him, including - and so have the Daily News and New York Post, and The New York Times editorial today said that term limits were a bad thing.",
        "But having said that, in 1993 and 1996, voters in New York City voted overwhelmingly to have term limits.",
        "And so what he would - what Bloomberg would like to do is to do a temporary change in City Council law.",
        "The City Council would pass a little waiver just because of his economic expertise, he could run for the third time.",
        "For the emergency, yeah.",
        "And look, after what's happened this week on Wall Street, he might need the job.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Right, exactly.",
        "We'll see about that.",
        "But you know, in 1940, Wendell Willkie put out a button, \"\"No third term and no indispensable man.\"\" And there are lot of people who feel that nobody's indispensable.",
        "But I guess in New York City, if anybody could make it work, it's Michael Bloomberg.",
        "And he probably could get it rammed through."

        "It seems to have landed with both sides having behaved themselves fairly well, and both men acquitted themselves really well.",
        "You're talking about the presidential debate...",
        "Yes, of course.",
        "Yeah.",

        "The expectation game had Barack Obama clearly going to be the winner.",
        "I thought for that reason McCain did well, but again, if Barack Obama went into the debate with a lead, and he did, and he came out and nothing changed in the debate, and he came out with a lead, in that sense, it's a win for Obama because it didn't change the dynamics of the race.",
        "And some people said this was John McCain's best chance.",
        "This was the foreign policy debate.",
        "Of course, the first, what, 40 minutes were about the economic situation, not unconnected to foreign policy but nevertheless not John McCain's real house.",
        "This was his best chance, at least on the topics that were announced.",
        "But we still have two more presidential debates and we have the vice presidential debate tomorrow night.",
        "And again, stranger things have happened.",
        "But as you said in the beginning of the show, there are some indications, the Pew poll that has come out and several state polls show that Obama slightly increasing his lead nationally and in key battleground states.",
        "Well, we're going to be talking more about that, as we mentioned.",
        "But also, as you look ahead to the next presidential debate - of course, Thursday night we have the vice presidential - but the next presidential debate, town hall style again, a technique that John McCain is extremely comfortable with.",
        "Is McCain seen as a Republican?",
        "I mean, obviously, people in Nevada know him from next door in Arizona, where he's got this maverick...",
        "Right.",
        "Yes.",
        "But I think both of them looked very comfortable in last week's debate.",
        "Barack Obama, certainly, I think his comfort level was there.",
        "If Barack Obama's goal was to show that he was presidential - sounds like with John Kennedy needed to prove against Richard Nixon in 1960 debates - I thought he did accomplish that but at the same time, John McCain's knowledge of world affairs showed, as well.",
        "And again, it was a draw but a draw may favor the challenger here."
