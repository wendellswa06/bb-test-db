        "They've been kind enough to be with us several times through the campaign.",
        "And let me ask both of you, these Quinnipiac polls are maybe outliers but they're interesting in that they show Obama with significant leads in these three key swing states.",
        "And you'd have to think, Vin, that John McCain would have to win all three of those.",
        "I think you're right.",
        "There's no question that the last two weeks, just to pick a timeframe, have shown a trend toward the Democrats across the board.",
        "John McCain has lost ground to Obama.",
        "Nationally, he's lost ground in just about every swing state, maybe except in New Hampshire, although maybe you know something I don't.",
        "But it's across the board.",
        "It's related directly to the economic problem.",
        "The only thing I would say as a Republican is at any time on this race since at least the beginning of summer, if we had looked at a two-week or three-week period of time and said, if present trends continue...",
        "Continue.",
        "This is what's going to happen, we would have been wrong.",
        "I mean, you know, Obama had a couple of weeks after he locked up the nomination in June.",
        "Then in July, McCain had a surge and he almost got it even at the time of the Democratic Convention.",
        "And then Obama surged ahead a little bit.",
        "And then McCain surged ahead a little bit.",
        "This is certainly a surge for the Democrats, but I think that to project this out for 30 days is a mistake.",
        "It depends on what's going to happen with the bailout on Capitol Hill, it's going to depend on what happens in the real economy, and it's going to depend on what other issues come up in the course of the next 30 days.",
        "And of course, it depends on the debates.",
        "And it's been a volatile time.",
        "But Anna Greenberg, as you look at it - as you look at the blue states and red states, the 51 battlegrounds that we've got, you can't see - I don't see looking at that that there are any blue states, states than John Kerry won where Barack Obama is not in the lead.",
        "Some are narrow, but he seems to be in the lead in all of them."

        "It is true that part of what's happened over the last - I would say, three weeks - is the - to survive economic crisis.",
        "And in general, economic issues tend to favor Democrats when those are the most important issues.",

        "Maybe.",
        "I mean, it's going to be hard.",

        "I think the debate did change minds.",
        "I don't think it turned anyone against John McCain but I think that Barack Obama did well.",
        "And he needed to establish, sort of, a threshold level of credibility, particularly on foreign policy issues, and he performed well enough to do that.",
        "That's going into the debate, that's what everybody said that he had to do, and I think he did.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, the dial groups that we did that night and looking pre-post to the debate, we saw less movement on economic issues - where I think, actually, it was sort of a draw, the first 40 minutes - and big movement on all these issues of foreign policy.",
        "And I think there's an assumption that McCain should be better on these issues.",
        "But I think that's been an assumption.",
        "I actually think that, you know, Obama's always been pretty strong and conversant and people just need to see it on the national stage.",

        "And only Obama has been on the air in Florida.",
        "Now I think that McCain's going to have to go up on the air because it's becoming so competitive.",
        "So it's moving into a different column from McCain.",
        "I think that's potentially problematic given that he's got some sniffing-at-resource constrains that Obama doesn't have."

        "So he hasn't felt the need of advertising.",
        "The swing vote in - or the big question mark over Florida, I think, and you'll probably agree with me, is what's happening with the Hispanic vote this time around?",
        "Republicans have usually been able to dominate the Hispanic vote, which is predominantly - not entirely, but predominantly - Cuban-American in South Florida.",
        "There's some indication that that might be changing, particularly among younger Cubans this time, Cuban-Americans.",

        "We may not win in Virginia and North Carolina, Georgia but we will force them to spend time and effort there.",
        "Yes.",

        "And as you probably know, Washoe County is a huge battleground county.",
        "And the other issue is McCain hasn't had much of a presence at all yet.",
        "I guess they said, in the next couple of weeks we'll see a lot of paid staffers canvassing the area.",
