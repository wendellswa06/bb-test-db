        "But we think McCain has held up pretty well there.",
        "Colorado looks like a tough state.",
        "I mean, I wouldn't say that it's non-competitive anymore, but Obama has held a lead outside the margin of error.",
        "I believe - just barely outside the margin of error - for some time now.",
        "And New Mexico remains competitive, too, but that was a state that went against Bush in 2000, swung back to Bush narrowly in 2004, you got a popular governor there putting himself on the line for Senator Obama.",
        "Those three states are all important...",
        "Ken had said the campaign looks like it's going to the Democrats.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That those three states are all in play and probably will remain in play, but Nevada is probably the most likely to remain Republican of the three.",

        "I agree with the message but the ad turned my stomach.",
        "And Ken, have the 527 groups - those - these are the outside groups who can operate under that part of the tax law, have they been playing a big part in the campaign this time?",
        "Well, it's hard to say.",
        "I mean, the poll - the ads have been up, and they've been reported by all the, you know, media markets and all that stuff, but I don't know if they have made that much of a difference.",

        "Barack Obama sent pretty clear signals that he didn't want donors to write big checks to these outside groups.",
        "But on the Republican side, we're also seeing significantly less money.",
        "And a lot of the people who funded, say, swift vote and other groups, are opting out or spending much less.",
        "You know, for a lot of reasons, either because Obama or because they think McCain is not going to win.",

        "My name is Hajiar.",
        "I'm from Berkley, California, and I have a question.",
        "In light of the recent Republican demands and John McCain's step up his attacks against Barack Obama over the past couple of days, do you see both campaigns turning negative once again, or do you see John McCain understanding that the negative, dirty politics has backfired in a sense?",
        "Well, I think both campaigns have been negative, and I think both campaigns will get more negative.",
        "Yeah, I mean if you look at the advertising - and people who live in battleground states know this, know that both campaigns have been fairly negative - I think what Barack Obama can do because of money is actually have a couple tracks of media-ops.",
        "So he's got very strong, positive ads straight to camera, and then a track of negative.",
        "But it's never - the ads have been negative.",
        "You know, really since before the conventions, yeah."

        "I, by the way, don't agree with the notion that negative equals dirty.",
        "You can have a dirty campaign, there's no question about that, but negative ads can convey even more precise and accurate information than positive ads, and frequently do.",
        "It is.",
        "I like this is one.",
        "But the two things that I think, you know, we might see happen, are, you know, I think McCain in some, you know, stepping up the attacks, as you say.",
        "But one of things that came out of the debates, clearly he was seen as more negative.",
        "It was, I don't - I think even though in some ways the debate was a draw, especially on economic issues, I think people came out feeling like McCain was pretty nasty.",
        "The other piece is going back to these outside groups.",
        "There's now push to air ads against Obama that mention, you know, Reverend Wright, that mention Bill Ayers, and you've seen those on the Internet and there's very small bias right now.",
        "But I think that's where you'll see some of the nastiest, you know, come in.",
        "I agree with that.",
        "It's also interesting, though, the Democrats who say that McCain was too nasty during the debate are the same people who say that they want Barack Obama to be more negative in taking it to John McCain.",

        "In Colorado we're getting that ton of negative advertising, and a lot of that is in our Senate campaign as well.",
        "But that's what I hear most people saying they're completely tired of, and the trickledown that I wonder is happening from that is here Colorado, and then my mom in Missouri, both a friend here and my mom had Obama signs stolen out of their yard.",

        "Yeah.",
        "It does get - as it becomes more partisan as it gets down to the last couple of weeks - the last four weeks now of this campaign, four weeks and a little bit more, Ken, people do get very excited and do things that if they actually talked to the campaign they would tell them not to do.",
