        "They say that if they had an opportunity to, you know, debate.",

        "He appointed a bipartisan group, very good commissioners who ran the state in a pretty much non-partisan way.",
        "He became very unpopular because of things he said, which in many cases had nothing to do with his being governor because - for instance, he dished organized religions, he said it was for people with weak minds.",

        "I mean, organized churches, a whole string of private colleges that are church-based in Minnesota.",
        "A whole thing - but that had nothing to do with being governor of Minnesota.",
