        "When the Russians invaded Northern Georgia, John McCain saw a boost in the polls.",
        "Maybe it was really other things, maybe it was related to that.",
        "But if people's attention focused back on the many dangers we face around the world right now, and there are more than there are usually are - I mean, Pakistan, Iran, you know, look and look and look.",
        "That could change the shape of this campaign.",
        "The other thing is a mistake by somebody.",
        "We have three more debates to go and the last debate was good because - for Obama because he didn't - because he lived up to a certain standard.",
        "It wasn't really bad for McCain.",
        "But the times the debates are really decisive, I think Ken would agree with me and Anna, too, is when somebody makes a big mistake.",
        "Liberates the people of polls.",
        "Liberates of polls, something like that.",
        "And that's with three more debates to go, or at least two at the presidential level, and that's what you have to look for.",
        "All right, again, we will reconvene before then.",
        "But thank you both very much.",

        "You can read his column at npr.org.",
        "Is this week's coming up?",
        "Well, in a midterm election like this one, history suggests it's going to be a pretty rough year for the party that controls the White House.",
        "And certainly that's true in the House, where Democrats don't appear to have much of a shot at winning a majority and probably would be pretty happy just to limit the number of Republican gains.",
        "So the real drama this year of course, is in the Senate, where Republicans need to pick up six seats to win control.",
        "Can they do that?",
        "They have a pretty good shot at it, since Democrats are forced to defend more seats this fall in total than Republicans do.",
        "And since polls also suggest that roughly a half dozen Democratic-held Senate seats are razor-close at this moment."

        "Well, let's talk about some of the Senate races that you're watching especially closely.",
        "Well, certainly the Kentucky Senate race is one of the more electrifying contests this year, in large part because the most powerful Republican in the Senate, majority leader Mitch McConnell, is getting one of the toughest challenges of his career from Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes.",
        "And since you could argue that the road to a Senate majority runs through the South, I'm also keeping close tabs on the southern races this year - Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina.",
        "And the Arkansas Senate race in particular is really fascinating - there, you've got Senator Mark Pryor, who is himself the son of a former senator.",
        "And he's gone from having no Republican at all in his last election campaign to being in a barn burner of a race in a state where the president is deeply unpopular.",
        "And Charlie, let's talk about the governor's race in Florida, in which we mentioned two familiar names on the Democratic and Republic side for Florida voters.",
        "Well, this is a great race and if I could only pick one race to follow this year, the Florida governor's race would definitely be it because it's nasty, it's big, it's expensive, the characters are fascinating.",
        "And it's all unfolding in one of the nation's largest and most diverse states.",
        "By picking Charlie Crist as their nominee, Democrats elected or nominated one of the most inscrutable politicians in the nation.",
        "He's gone from running as a pro-Ronald Reagan conservative politician to running now as someone who's almost a liberal Democrat.",
        "And he's also incredibly talented at the retail aspect of politics - he really connect with voters.",
        "And now he's going to be pitted against the incumbent, Republican Rick Scott, who stylistically is almost the opposite.",
        "Scott's problem is that he really struggles to connect with average voters.",
        "And so this is going to be one of the most interesting races to watch this year.",
        "So Charlie, if you step back and try to say, here's what the election of 2014 is going to be about, here's the narrative - what do you come up with?",
        "Well, the odd thing is, you come up with almost nothing.",
        "It's an election about nothing.",
        "And this is a discussion we've had on the Washington desk and trying to wrap our arms around the idea of what is the primary overarching issue of this election?",
        "And that what we see is that the parties are really just beating each other up, trying to gin up energy in their bases to turn out in November.",
        "We've seen that the Affordable Care Act has lost some of its political saliency, jobs and economic issues matter a great deal at the polls, but certainly not at the high levels we saw a few years ago.",
        "And even immigration isn't moving voters in both parties to the same degree.",
        "And I think it's largely because we don't have the war in Iraq, as in 2006, or the passage of the Affordable Care Act, as in 2010, driving voters and generating interest among politicians.",
        "That's NPR Politics editor Charlie Mahtesian.",

        "A magnitude 6.0 earthquake jolted Northern California's Napa Valley this morning.",
        "It was the strongest earthquake in that region in 25 years.",
        "And the city is trying to get a handle on the damage - broken water mains, leaking gas lines and more than a dozen buildings in Napa that have been red tagged meaning they are currently uninhabitable.",
        "But Napa city manager Mike Parness says the area is well on its way to recovery."

        "Well, you know, just a short while ago, I was standing at the corner of Second Street and Main in Napa's historical downtown district.",
        "And I have to tell you, Tess, that the quake that hit last night had very little respect for history.",
        "The most obvious damage is sustained by older buildings with brick facades so that whole walls of brick are collapsed exposing the offices inside.",
        "And at ground-level, storefront windows buckled and shattered so that several downtown streets are just strewn with debris.",
        "There are some power outages, some streets still have signal lights and other blocks there's no power.",
        "And I drove through some residential neighborhoods where there is no power.",
        "And on several streets, the pavement ripped open.",
        "Where you see the most dramatic evidence of a force of this quake are back in the commercial district in the wine shops, with broken bottles and wine covering the floors as if, you know, someone had just come in with a baseball bat and wreaked havoc.",
        "Local residents say they have felt strong quakes before here, but this one was special, in part because it seemed to last so long and the authorities saying that it lasted between 10 to 20 seconds.",
        "Richard, what are authorities saying about the damage and the clean up?",
        "Well, Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency for Napa, Sonoma and Solano counties.",
        "These are the heart of Northern California's wine producing region.",
        "And keep in mind the quakes struck at 3:20 a.m. local time so that emergency officials jumped into action immediately.",
