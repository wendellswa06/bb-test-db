        "I mean, this was a tiny turnout for an event that got a ton of attention in the runup to it.",
        "Did it come as a surprise that no one really showed up?",
        "Yeah, you know, Jason Kessler, the organizer, he got a permit for up to 400 people, and in the end, it attracted fewer than 10 percent of that.",
        "Man.",
        "We were only able to count around 25 people.",
        "They were men, mostly, some wearing masks or bandanas over their faces.",
        "Kessler spoke to his group and to media for a little bit, but really, his message was just almost completely overshadowed by the counterdemonstrators, hundreds of them.",
        "A lot of people here were surprised and, I have to say, also thrilled.",
        "They described this as a victory.",
        "I spoke to one activist here who goes by the name EZ Street.",
        "He said he actually wound up feeling kind of sorry for Kessler's group.",
        "It shows us who they are.",
        "They don't have the simple love and compassion in their hearts for other people, man, and it's sad.",
        "It's sad.",
        "I'm sad for them more than anything.",
        "That is an extraordinary statement.",
        "Last year in Charlottesville at this same Unite the Right rally, a counterdemonstrator, a woman named Heather Heyer, was murdered by a white supremacist who drove a car into a crowd.",
        "So folks there were remembering and honoring her yesterday, huh?",
        "Yeah.",
        "There were a lot of signs in the crowd with Heather Heyer's name.",
        "People I talked to spoke about her emotionally.",
        "They said they were here in part because of her.",
        "But I have to say, people also talked about just wanting to stop the momentum of what the white nationalist movement has been doing a year ago.",
        "People were caught off guard by the scope and violence of Charlottesville, and this felt very different.",
        "I mean, this rally, it got a lot of attention in the runup, which was different from the Charlottesville rally, which seemed to come out of nowhere.",
        "We gave it some attention here on NPR.",
        "We interviewed Jason Kessler, who organized the rally, on Friday.",
        "I wonder, when you talked to people, did you ask them about the amount and the kind of attention this is getting and whether they think it's justified?",
        "Sure.",
        "And I did hear a lot of dismay and anger that so much of America's national conversation about race winds up being driven by people like this who, you know, have what are just flatly bigoted views.",
        "The interesting thing, I think, Noel, is that these counterdemonstrators worked hard to just shift the discussion.",
        "There was a lot of talk here about other aspects of race relations in America, poverty, segregation, criminal justice.",
        "I talked to a guy, DeAndre Fuentes (ph), who told me that this was deliberate.",
        "I'm here to show white supremacy that black people will meet you head-on."

        "You worry about that.",
        "So in the end, you know, most of what I wound up hearing about race here yesterday on the street from these different activist groups - it wasn't actually coming from Jason Kessler or his group of white supremacists; it was coming from these other people.",
        "Just very quickly before I let you go, did Kessler and the white supremacists express any embarrassment at the pathetic turnout?",
        "They tweeted and spoke about being proud of the fact that this was nonviolent.",
        "They said that they were proud of what they did here for free speech yesterday.",

        "And they have found that a few hundred miles off the coast of Georgia, there are concentrations of plastic as high as those in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.",

        "Well, I would say it's probably been kept secret by SEA Education Association for about 20 or 30 years.",
        "For about 40 years, we've been taking students to sea in the Atlantic, and as part of our SEA Semester program, students design scientific research projects that they carry out on board our sailing research vessels.",
        "So in support of those student research projects, we've been towing these plankton nets on the sea surface.",
        "And as early as the late 1970s, we began noticing little bits of plastic coming up in the nets, as well.",
        "So we've been collecting these data since then and just recently decided that the time was right to publish them.",
        "So if I go there, am I going to see just, like, you know, a garbage dump full of plastic?",
        "No, and that's actually a common misperception about these so-called garbage patches.",
        "Really, if I just put you on a ship in the middle of the Atlantic or the Pacific, you really wouldn't see anything, even when you were in the middle of this high-concentration zone."

        "Most of the bits of plastic that we collect are millimeters in size.",
        "So these are smaller than your pinky fingernail, and really you have to tow a net through a large portion of water to even collect them.",
        "So they're nothing that you can really see by eye.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, they actually don't pick the coast of Georgia.",
        "They decide to go far offshore.",
        "So it makes them even more difficult to find.",
        "But really, the answer to that is the surface currents of the ocean, and this is one of the major points of our work is that we have been able to use just basic ocean physics to explain why the plastic accumulates in this region.",
        "And the short of the answer is that surface currents come together in a region about the latitude of Atlanta but pretty far offshore.",
        "So anything floating with those surface currents, including plastic debris or any other kind of natural debris, is likely to concentrate there.",
        "And the mystery, if we're using more plastics, why aren't we seeing more plastic showing up?",
        "Where's it going?",
        "Where's all the plastic going?",
        "That is the million-dollar question.",
        "You know, we can't directly measure the amount of plastic that's entering the ocean.",
        "So we've used these records of global plastic production and municipal solid waste records from the U.S.",
        "to infer that more plastic is entering the ocean.",
        "We feel that if people are using more plastic and disposing of more plastic, it's likely that more plastic is going into the ocean.",
        "But in our records, we're collecting plastics just at the very surface of the ocean, and we haven't been able to account for an increase over this 20-year period.",
        "So we think there are a few reasons why this may be.",
        "First of all, the mesh size on the net is about a third of a millimeter in size.",
        "So we're only collecting pieces that are larger than that.",
        "And we know that the effects of UV radiation and wave action on these pieces can break them down into pieces smaller than our net size.",
        "So we could be missing a fraction that's still floating at the ocean surface, for example.",
        "And all of this is done by undergraduate students."
