        "But the immense water pressure there at that depth allowed the scientists to steer the submersible very close, within 10 feet or so, of the volcano eruption there.",

        "And it's a particular type of lava that's only been seen in extinct volcanoes that have erupted at least a million years ago.",
        "This is the first time they've ever seen it actually, you know, coming out on the Earth, you know, on land or at sea.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's a water-rich, magnesium-rich type of lava, and they're looking at these sorts of - you know, analyses of these samples to help them figure out, you know more about how Earth's, you know, tectonic activity recycles Earth's ocean crust.",
        "Another thing they were talking about there has to do with sort of a citizen-science approach to earthquake monitoring.",

        "And it has to do with people - well, one part of the program is something called the Quick Twitter Earthquake Detection Program.",
        "And what the USGS scientists have done is developed some software that essentially analyzes the incredible stream of information coming through Twitter.",
        "And they search for key words related to earthquakes, like quake, temblor, you know, tsunami, that sort of thing, and they can go through and analyze patterns of where those are coming from, if they're coming from, you know, devices that are location-enabled, GPS-enabled.",
        "And they can look at where these things are coming from and the description of, you know, what people are feeling to kind of get an idea of how widespread the quake is and how it might be felt.",
        "And they can see these sorts of things almost immediately as they're coming through the Twitter feed, as opposed to the analyses of, you know, seismometers and those sort of detailed things that help you pin down an epicenter, which sometimes takes 15 minutes or more.",
        "So you can - so through all - all these temblor Twitters that are coming in, they're more - I wouldn't say accurate, but they're faster.",
        "You get faster results from looking at the tweets than you do from looking at the instruments.",
        "Well, you do, yes.",
        "And so many earthquakes, I mean, some of the messages are as simple as, you know, earthquake, OMG.",

        "Wow.",
        "So that sort of information is really similar to another program that USGS has already got on its Web site called Did You Feel It, where people can go in and, you know, provide information about their zip code and, you know, what they felt it and when they felt it and that sort of thing.",
        "But that is much slower and much smaller data sample size than going in and, you know, just data-mining this feed as it's coming.",

        "We're going to talk more about this later in the hour.",

        "Another one of those citizen-seismologist projects is - USGS has developed a low-cost, rather inexpensive seismometer that can be put in people's basements to fill in holes in the network of seismographs that are usually put out very far from urban areas because they're very sensitive, and...",
