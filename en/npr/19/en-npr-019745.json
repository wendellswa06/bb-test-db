        "And I happened to create a product back then that was creation containers that looked just like caskets in size and shape.",
        "So when you cover a cremation container, which was cardboard, with a flag, as they did, you've simulated caskets.",
        "Disney saved a lot of money using Schiller's creations and news of his expertise spread.",

        "Dodie is hands-on about other things, as well.",
        "She and Schiller developed their own recipe for the blood that bubbles up in wounds and shows up in transfusion bags.",
        "Bruce Schiller's recipe is Karo Syrup, Red Dye Number 6...",
        "And sometimes chocolate syrup to give it a very thick consistency.",
