        "The indications are that he would do this with a six-month delay, which would give Congress time to pass legislation, make it a law and not just an executive action.",
        "There've been a lot of questions over DACA's legal standing.",
        "It's been challenged before.",
        "And several conservative states were preparing to challenge it again.",
        "That is why President Trump is making this decision today.",
        "That was their deadline.",
        "But in this White House especially, word can change a lot between the initial indications and the official announcement.",
        "Right.",
        "And on this particular issue, President Trump has been all over the map promising to end it as part of a hardline immigration stance when running for president, but since he's taken office, lots of either vague comments like what we just heard or reassuring comments saying that DREAMers have nothing to worry about.",
        "At the same time, leading Republicans, even Paul Ryan, speaker of the House, has suggested this isn't something the executive branch should tackle.",
        "This is a congressional thing.",
        "He wants Congress to manage this.",
        "Any chance that's going to happen and what would they do?",
        "Two long-term trends to think about.",
        "One is the fact that repeatedly, in recent years, Congress has been unable to pass immigration reform.",
        "Last big time this was attempted, 2013, it passed the Senate - wide bipartisan support - went absolutely nowhere in a Republican-controlled House.",
        "The other is that Congress has been unable to act up until this point this year on the big issues Republicans agree on, like cutting taxes, like scaling back Obamacare.",
        "So it's hard to see how there's going to suddenly be a consensus on an issue that's so divisive within the Republican Party.",
        "Congress is back to work today.",
        "What's on their plate?",
        "Number one item is keeping the government running - always a good place to start.",
        "(Laughter) For starters, yeah.",
        "They have to fund the government by the end of the month.",
        "There's also the issue of raising the debt limit that's due to run out later in September.",
        "That deadline might come earlier because of all the spending in Hurricane Harvey relief funding.",
        "Congress is probably going to act very quickly passing an $8 billion relief package for Harvey.",
        "Now, the White House wants them to tie that to raising the debt limit, but there's a lot of pushback from conservatives on that.",
        "And one other thing to watch for - the personal politics.",
        "President Trump devoted a fair bit of his summer to taking potshots at fellow Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.",
        "So now he needs them to get his agenda passed.",
        "And we wait to see how that's all going to shake out."
