        "So I was standing there, a few feet from the inmate, and the needle came out.",

        "It's changed a little bit over the years.",
        "It used to be a single room where you were separated from the inmate.",
        "And you would stand and watch at a rail with the inmate just a few feet from you.",
        "That changed in the early '90s I believe, late, maybe mid-90's when the state made a revision in the law that allowed witnesses for the murder victims to also attend.",
        "So they divided that room in half.",
        "So if you were looking at the room from above, it would be like in the shape of a T.",
        "And the inmate would be at the horizontal end of the T.",
        "And then at the opposite end of him are two, narrow, long rooms with space for people to stand.",

        "You stand in very close quarters.",
        "It's very narrow.",
        "If you were to stand in the center of the viewing area, you could probably stretch your arms out and touch the wall on either side.",
        "So it's pretty tight quarters.",

        "Once we got outside the prison and there were other reporters there, he had mentioned that basically, the dude just took a nap, is how he put it.",
        "That's essentially what happens in executions here when they use the pentobarbital or since they have used the pentobarbital.",
        "Then the inmate will take a couple of breaths, and then begins to snore and looks like he's going to sleep.",
        "And each snore gets progressively less pronounced.",

        "Well, Alex, Michigan sort of a became a flash point in the affirmative action wars in 2003 when the Supreme Court decided it's last really major affirmative action case about the University of Michigan's admission policy.",
        "And you'll probably remember that was pretty contentious decision.",
        "The Supreme Court ended up upholding the law school at the University of Michigan's policy.",
        "Its affirmative action policy used race as a factor, not a sort of rigid point system but one of many factors in its admission decisions.",
        "The court struck down the undergraduate admissions policy which used a very rigid sort of points or quota system in evaluating the place of race and making admission decisions.",
        "Sandra Day O'Connor of course tipped the balance as she did so often.",
        "So now literally the day after the Michigan decision came down from the Supreme Court efforts were made to pass legislation that would get rid of affirmative action all together in Michigan.",
        "And that lead to this Michigan civil rights initiative which is on the ballot for November.",
        "This would bar the use of affirmative action in any government hiring in government contracts and in university admissions.",
        "It's modeled after similar initiatives that took place in California and Washington state.",
        "So these are the people who are against affirmative action are pushing this.",
        "But the polls we've seen so far suggest their arguments are not holding that much sway with Michigan voters.",
        "That's right, Alex.",
        "Recent polls in Michigan are showing that about 41 percent of Michigan voters support this ban on affirmative action.",
        "About 43 percent oppose it.",
        "But, you know, as is always the case in these questions about affirmative action, everything sort of turns on how it's worded in the initiative, and that's obviously something of a fight.",
        "But really so much depends on what language they use to describe what they're trying to do.",
        "Unless you think that the consequences aren't serious, California, who passed an initiative like this in 1996, is seeing real fallout.",
        "The UCLA freshman class this year has 96 black freshmen in an entering class of 4,700 - that's a 30-year low.",
        "So these initiatives if they pass have tremendous impact going down the line on student admissions."
