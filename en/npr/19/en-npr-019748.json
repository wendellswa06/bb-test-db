        "There had been national security leaks out of the Trump administration, and Nixon dealt primarily with national security leaks.",
        "What happened is that some of the positions he was contemplating in Vietnam often ended up on the front page of either The New York Times or The Washington Post.",
        "And that would preclude his options.",
        "And that, he felt, was quite unfair and not good for the country.",
        "Trump's leaks, some have come through the national security community, but they've been regarding his attitudes towards the national security community, which has not been a particularly healthy relationship.",
        "You're saying the difference is perhaps more personal - that under Nixon's time, it was exposing decisions about national security that were being discussed.",
        "In this case, this is revealing, like, the president's personal views about people who are working for him."

        "That is correct.",
        "That is correct.",

        "Well, he authorized, for example, in three different taped, recorded conversations that he was ordering and wanted a break-in at the Brookings Institute.",

        "Yeah.",
        "That word got down that break-ins were something the president thought were OK.",
        "So that's where the very early origins of the kind of mentality that would result in a Watergate were first formulated.",
        "Well, yeah, in March, you said you were already hearing echoes of Watergate - that you were seeing this from the Trump administration.",
        "Although, you said said it's not quite Watergate 2.0.",
        "Is that still your assessment?",
        "I think that is.",
        "But why do you make the comparison to Watergate?",
        "I mean, it's - has anything nefarious really been proven when it comes to Trump?",
        "Well, there are comparisons because, first of all, Watergate was about influencing an election - the '72 election.",
        "The Russiagate (ph), for purposes of this conversation, it too has to do with influencing an election.",
        "The echoes I hear are - there is clearly a cover-up in the White House.",
        "If you did not want to have all this suspicion about what they're doing, you'd have everybody who was involved come into a room and say, OK, I want sworn affidavits.",
        "I don't want to have this hanging over my administration, and I want it done yesterday.",
        "Well, that's exactly the opposite of what they're doing.",
        "So this is very similar to the pattern in Watergate.",
        "The firing of Comey, to ask him to stop the investigation of Flynn, was not unlike Nixon sending the CIA over to the FBI to get them to cut off the investigation.",
        "They're echoes.",
        "And during Watergate, we wrote what you shouldn't do.",

        "Well, we'll see.",
        "A very sophisticated investigator in Bob Mueller I don't think would be wasting his time if nothing was there.",
        "You famously told Richard Nixon that the Watergate break-in and the cover-up was a cancer on the presidency.",
        "Do you think conversations like that are happening right now inside this White House - aides talking to President Trump about what it all means that this is swirling?",
        "You know, there has been a change in tone in the last few days.",
        "They're not quite as aggressive in trying to discredit the investigation.",
        "Maybe they've figured out that rather than trying to fight everything, to try to get the investigation over."

        "So the senators who have delivered their opening statements today--Senator Arlen Specter, so far, Patrick Leahy, the ranking senator--the ranking Democrat from Vermont, and others have said both of these two issues, abortion and executive power, are going to be very important as the hearings progress.",
