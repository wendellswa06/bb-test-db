        "Republicans are sort of doing a bit of defense.",
        "Of course, Senator Arlen Specter, the chairman, is a Republican, but he's pro-choice, which makes things a little more complicated.",
        "But other senators such as Orrin Hatch so far have said that--they're defending Alito's judicial temperament, talking about his conservatism and his understanding of the proper role of the judge in the legal system.",
        "Now the last time we had these hearings it was last summer, when the Judiciary Committee held confirmation hearings for John Roberts, now the chief justice of the Supreme Court.",
        "Those hearings were quite cordial, and so why shouldn't it be the same with Judge Alito?",
        "Senator Specter says he expects Alito's hearings to be more contentious than Roberts' were, and there are a few reasons for that.",
        "There are some differences between Roberts and Alito.",
        "For example, Roberts was only on the bench as a federal judge for three years, so he had a much shorter judicial paper trail than Alito, who was on the bench for 15 years.",
        "Roberts' writings as a lawyer in the Justice Department were somewhat more muted than the writings from Alito that have come out.",
        "And the other thing is that Roberts replaced the now late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who was very conservative.",
        "Alito was nominated to replace the retiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who's often been a swing vote.",
        "And that's something that several of the senators have mentioned in their opening statements so far, that because Alito is replacing O'Connor, they consider this confirmation hearing to be much more high stakes than the last one.",
        "And what about Alito's personal demeanor?",
        "Will that factor into the tone of these hearings?",
        "Well, we've heard from the people who have been working with Alito on what they call the murder boards, which are the mock hearings that they've been doing in the weeks leading up to this week, and they say that Alito comes across as less of a Washington insider than Roberts did.",
        "He seems like more of an average guy.",
        "He's very smart, but they say that perhaps he's not quite as smooth and composed as Roberts was.",
        "And there was some talk about a delay in the vote in the full Senate.",
        "Is that going to happen?",
        "The Democrats have asked for a one-week delay.",
        "It seems as though even this late in the game, they're still looking for more details about Alito.",
        "I heard from some Hill staffers that even to this moment, they're looking for things that could justify certain centrist Democrats casting a no vote, evidence that would show Alito would not be good for the specific Democrats' constituencies.",
        "Several of the Democrats said this morning that they're still undecided, but that the hearings will decide for them how they'll cast their vote.",
        "NPR's Ari Shapiro, thank you very much.",
        "You're welcome."
