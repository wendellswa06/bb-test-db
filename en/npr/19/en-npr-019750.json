        "Well, sure.",

        "They would say during President Trump's tenure in office, of the nine special elections for red district seats, eight have been held by the GOP.",
        "But if you dig just beneath the surface of those talking points, there are certainly red flags or perhaps blue flags...",
        "(Laughter).",

        "Well, it sounds like you both agree that on paper, Republicans have been doing OK in these special elections.",
        "And come November, you're not expecting them to hold on to control of the House.",
        "Look; I think it's early still to make any solid bets on what the November elections are going to bring.",
        "I would - if I were to put down my own money today, I would probably put it on the Democrats to win the House, right?",
        "But it could go still either direction.",
        "What I would say - what's interesting out of Ohio, among other things, is that was a district President Trump won by 11 points.",
        "The previous Republican congressman won it in 2016 by a landslide.",
        "This was a one-point race, give or take.",
        "And without Trump coming in the weekend before to fire up some elements of the base plus, crucially, a very strong endorsement from Governor John Kasich, who is not fond of the president but they are both Republicans - they actually had this unusual alliance where they...",

        "And when the people they endorsed didn't win their primaries, there were a lot of headlines saying, you know, that the night was a big loss for the left, that, you know, socialists are going down.",
        "And to me, those were strange headlines first of all because the number of likely members of democratic socialists of America who will almost certainly be elected to Congress in November has gone from one to two - you know, from...",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "...Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to, you know, the first Muslim woman who will probably be elected to Congress out of Michigan - and also because the candidates who are considered, quote, unquote, \"\"establishment,\"\" you know, even four or eight years ago would have been considered extremely progressive.",
        "I know...",
        "And so you can really see the whole center of gravity of the party moving towards the - I think towards the beliefs of a large part of the base that had been previously pretty frustrated with the party's leadership.",
