        "The kind of oil used at the plant costs about $100 a barrel nowadays, many times the price that prevailed when those boilers were installed decades ago.",
        "With oil prices so high this past winter, the company had to make a tough decision to save money.",
        "It chose to keep the workers warm rather than continue paper production at high levels.",
        "But next year, if all goes as planned, Great Northern Paper likely won't have to make such a penny-pinching choice.",
        "That's because the mill has started converting one of its boilers to run on much cheaper natural gas.",
        "Anybody that is a high consumer of energy will be looking at significant cost savings if they convert to natural gas.",
        "Tom Runiewicz, an economist with the firm IHS Global Insight, says that's why many companies that use big industrial boilers and furnaces are also making the switch.",
        "But Runiewicz says it may not be easy for some companies that want to convert to natural gas to get a regular supply of it.",
        "The most efficient way to do that is to pipeline.",
        "That infrastructure will have to be developed and further enhanced to get the full advantage of, you know, the natural gas energy source.",
        "Northern New England has a very limited pipeline system.",
        "State lawmakers in Maine are trying to pass bills to pave the way for an expansion.",
        "In the meantime, Great Northern Paper has found its own short-term solution.",
        "These are the trailers that actually transport the gas.",
        "We are a pipeline on wheels, if you will.",
        "Clyde Coleman heads up engineering for Express Natural Gas, or XNG.",
        "The young company has just started trucking natural gas to customers in Maine from its compression station near the Canadian border.",
        "Ned Dwyer says the boiler conversion is scheduled to be completed in June.",
        "It allows us to run a second vapor machine in the wintertime.",
        "It produces about another 40 jobs.",
        "And it gives Great Northern Paper the best chance of holding on to its more than 200 workers.",
        "Just two years ago, those people were laid off for four months during tough times.",
        "Now, they're hoping the energy cost reductions will help their plant continue operating even when the weather or the economy turn cold.",

        "Kenneth Feinberg will administer the $20 billion fund set to compensate oil-spill victims.",
        "And as NPR's Wendy Kaufman reports, the process is already under fire for being unfair.",

        "And Comey expresses concern about what impact this has on the country.",
        "One thing in particular - he compares Trump to a mafia boss.",
        "Now, remember - Comey worked mob cases when he was a federal prosecutor early in his career, and so this is coming from experience.",
        "But if you're looking for some sort of grand revelation on the Russia investigation, you're not going to get that here.",
        "But we do get sort of an insider's view on a series of very important things that took place over the past couple years, including on the Hillary Clinton investigation, as well as, of course, Comey's interactions with Trump.",

        "He didn't respond.",
        "He said nothing.",
