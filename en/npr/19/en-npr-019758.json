        "I'll tell you, the last time there was a big effort to get rid of the Electoral College was in 1969, when the House of Representatives actually did pass a resolution to abolish the Electoral College.",
        "It failed in the Senate.",
        "It was after very close elections of 1960 and 1968.",
        "One of the main proponents of getting rid of the Electoral College - and I've gone back and looked at the transcripts - was my father, Hale Boggs, who was majority whip at the time.",

        "And so, for instance, in Barack Obama's 2012 election, it was the African-American vote in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan that put him over the top.",
        "The same with the Hispanic vote - nationwide, it was 11 percent.",
        "But in Colorado, Nevada, it makes all the difference.",

        "On the contrary, they feel Republicans lost because conservative principles weren't followed.",
        "So there's a sense that Republicans in some ways got what they deserved.",

        "And of course conservatives are also thinking about electability; the fact that he is 70 years old; he would be the oldest president when he's elected.",
        "He has had health problems.",
