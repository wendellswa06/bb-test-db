        "So not only has he not taken the lesson from the previous strike, but he's in a stronger position.",

        "So that would be a way that the Russians could be drawn in.",

        "He has Trump's ear.",

        "Rochelle, what about you?",
        "You know, that's such a good point because, not only in Detroit, but outside of Detroit, this is not something that was talked about in the way that you saw it on television.",
        "There were people who, for years, didn't understand why it happened or tried to, you know, come up with the reasons why it happened instead of focusing on what people had been talking about.",
        "And that's the fact that this was a city under siege by the police and poverty and discrimination for decades before it was a city under siege for five days.",
        "So we really do have to do a better job of the history.",

        "When I first moved to Michigan 14 years ago, I lived in Lansing.",
        "And the white folks wanted to tell me about the 1967 riots.",
        "That's the only term they used.",

        "Yeah, we did a poll last year.",
        "The Detroit Journalism Cooperative did a poll talking to folks in all-white communities and mixed-race communities and all-black communities.",

        "There's still that 15 percent of white folks who are convinced that's what happened and that's what was going on.",
        "But I think attitudes have changed slowly.",
        "So, you know, one of the reasons that this whole topic is resonant for many people is not just because of the history but because of what's happening now and what we're seeing in a lot of cities around the country, you know, not on the same scale, you know, to be sure.",
        "I mean, it's important for people to know, like, this is - number one, this is a big city, period.",

        "Like, does it feel itself to be part of today's civil rights movement, the Black Lives Matter movement?",
        "Because that doesn't seem to be at the forefront of what's in the headlines here.",
        "Well, it depends on the people that you talk to.",
        "There are longtime activists who have been fighting for better equality and fighting against police misbehavior who would say that there should have been a Black Lives Matter movement here decades ago.",
        "There are people today who say that we're a match away from '67 happening again, which the police chief firmly, firmly, not only denies but says won't happen.",
        "And he was a little boy, 10 years old, in '67, who, at 20, became a cop who saw the racism firsthand and vowed to one day be chief.",
        "And lo and behold, here he is.",
        "But I think the biggest problem is the reason Black Lives Matter resonates is because a single person died.",
        "You're talking about something that's so big, so large with the discrimination and the police abuse in Detroit, that it wasn't seen the same way.",
        "It's still not seen the same way, but it should be."

        "Is there just a job - what's the issue here?",
        "There's always been a - chronically, Detroit's unemployment level is twice that of the state, and that hasn't changed at all.",
        "Even with the states lower, it's still really high, pretty darn high in Detroit.",
        "The other thing is, you know, the public transportation system is still not good enough for people to go get a job.",
        "Auto insurance in Detroit is - it's the highest in the nation, so people can't afford auto insurance.",
        "So just getting to a job is one of the big hurdles.",
        "And that's just the beginning.",
        "So, Aaron, is that, in part, what your book is about?",
        "Which is that if you're one of the people who's benefiting from the rise of Detroit, don't be a - forgive me, Mom - a jackass to the people who aren't.",
        "Is that part of what the deal is for you?",
        "It's along that line.",
        "Like, why I wrote the book was because there - long story short, there were a lot of younger white people moving into Detroit, right?",
        "Not just young white people but young people from all backgrounds and who were not familiar with the same kind of Detroit that I knew growing up, the same Detroit I loved growing up.",
        "And people kind of moved to downtown and midtown and just sort of surround themselves in that bubble.",
        "But downtown and midtown are only 7.2 square miles.",
        "They're a very important 7.2 square miles, don't get me wrong, but the whole city is a 143.",
        "And people were saying things like, don't go past, you know, the boulevard - Grand Boulevard.",
        "Don't go past MLK, you know, you're going to get shot, you're going to get this, you're going to get that.",
        "And it's just like, I've - I'm still here.",
        "I've never been shot in my life.",
        "Not to say that crime doesn't happen, that violence doesn't happen, but I got tired of people saying things in general about Detroit.",
        "And I'm looking around at, like, my friends, my classmates, my aunts, my uncles, my parents, all these people that call Detroit home at some point or another, and we love this city like no other."
