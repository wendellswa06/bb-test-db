        "With the exception of the people who are retiring, Bill Frist, who was the majority leader in the Senate, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, who's stepping down from the leadership - he hasn't retired from the House - basically we're seeing all the same leaders that we saw before.",
        "It's just that the Democrats will now be in the majority and the Republicans in the minority.",
        "There is one new old name, or old new name, of course, and that's Trent Lott.",
        "He was the former majority leader, had to leave after making overly fulsome comments at Strom Thurmond's birthday, and now he's back.",
        "That was indeed a surprise.",
        "He really entered the race for - he's going to be the minority whip in the Senate and he entered the race really at the last minute, defeated Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, and I think he'd been working his way back slowly.",
        "He's an old institutionalist in the Senate.",
        "He knows a lot about it.",
        "He'd been in the leadership in the House.",
        "His Republican colleagues thought he'd spent his time in the wilderness and it was time to bring him back.",
        "And does his return say something about the nature of the Republican Party now?",
        "Certainly in the Senate it says something about the geography of the Republican Party, that is really a party of the South, that the leaders, if you look at them, the Senate Republican leaders are now from Kentucky and Mississippi and Texas and Arizona.",
        "And we used to talk about the solid South, meaning the solid south for Democrats, and now you have the solid...",
        "When Strom Thurmond was a Democrat.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "Now you have the solid South for Republicans.",
        "There's a lot of ink spilled all over the pages this week about Nancy Pelosi.",
        "She won her own race unanimously to be the next speaker of the House, but the candidate she backed for number two lost, and by wide margin."

        "Yes, that's right.",
        "She wanted John Murtha, who of course had managed her campaign several years ago when she was running for the Democratic whip spot, and she was - she really didn't just endorse him, sent out a letter, which she obviously had to do, but she was really twisting arms for this.",
        "And it was a lot of capital that she spent and it didn't work.",
        "He was beaten rather handily by Maryland's Steny Hoyer, with whom Pelosi has had kind of a rivalry.",
        "They're actually both from Maryland originally.",
        "And there's some thought that this is going to hurt her down the line, that she really had made it very public that she wanted Murtha, that she got Hoyer.",
        "But frankly, this has happened before, and probably it won't - after some months I think everyone will forget about it.",
        "For all the renewed pledges of bipartisanship, is there much in the record of these new old leaders to suggest that there will be more bipartisanship?",
        "It's really hard to say.",
        "I think we're talking about 2008 now.",
        "Everybody's looking towards the presidential elections.",
        "The parties have changed a little bit.",
        "You've lost a lot of Republican moderates, particularly in the House.",
        "So the House is going to tack a little bit to the right.",
        "Interesting - so are the Democrats going to tack a little bit to the right because a lot of their new members are more conservative, who've beaten some of these Republican moderates.",
        "So that might have a tendency to bring them together.",

        "Mr. Wallis is an evangelical minister and founder of the Christian ministry group Sojourners.",

        "Especially at the beginning, because you need money to raise money.",
        "But Barack Obama is a special case.",
        "He does not need to buy media right now, or anytime soon, because at this moment the media are falling all over themselves for the chance to sell him to the public.",
        "He is the fresh element.",

        "But as John noted a few moments ago, Hillary Clinton is still at the top of the polls and has a lot more money than anyone else.",
        "She's still getting roughly a third of the preference votes.",
        "Others are down in the low teens for now, and financially she's in the lead because she had a lot of money for a Senate fund.",
        "But she's spent that down in her Senate race a little more than people expected, keeping her margin of victory high.",
        "And her real edge, I would say, is that over the last 15 years, she and Bill and Al Gore have built up the most formidable money-raising connections in the Democratic Party.",
        "It's New York.",
        "It's also California, Florida, Chicago.",

        "But if the money lead attaches to a candidate with other compelling claims on the nomination, it's truly formidable.",

        "And she may have them.",
        "But you know, she's raised questions of electability, partly because she is not the candidate of the anti-war Democrats, and Obama can hurt her on that issue.",
        "Well, what about the Web and the ability to raise small-time donations there?",
        "Could Obama be competitive there?",
        "Barack Obama will certainly go that route, and he could be the Howard Dean of 2008.",
        "You remember four years ago how Howard Dean used the Internet to raise enormous amounts of money, and as for bundlers, the people who put together contributions from other people, they're going to come out of the woodwork for him, I think, when they see some of that money coming in.",
        "And he's also got it the super-deep pocket people like George Soros in the wings, because Soros, while he can't simply fund a candidate, has been a Barack Obama fan for years, and billionaires can find ways to be helpful.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Let's turn to the Republicans on that note.",
        "Who's raising money there?",
        "John McCain of Arizona, of course, and also Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts.",
        "Rudy Giuliani runs well in the polls.",
        "He's right up there with McCain in some and he has access to New York money, like Wall Street and so on.",
        "But he has yet to build the kind of organization he would need, and frankly, I don't think he has the kind of positions on social issues he would need to be nominated, so a lot of people questioned how serious Giuliani really is at this point."

        "Well, McCain is not only the frontrunner in the polls, but also in money because he has tapped into a lot of the Bush fundraising organization, which is the gold standard in the Republican Party.",

        "He's got Massachusetts.",
        "He's got some New York connections in business.",
