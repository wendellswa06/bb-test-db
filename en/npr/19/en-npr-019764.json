        "I mean, my belief is that you should never have a database where personal information is actually stored with a biometric.",
        "That those things should be separate because if somebody gets all of that information, then there's potentially a huge issue with identity fraud, and theft, and all of those sort of things, and the other area where I think we also need to be seriously looking at how we manage this, is in terms of rolling out large scale deployments like the UK is looking at with their National ID card.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Technology always reaches breaking points as it increases in the, in this kind of application, the volume of the application, the number of people that are using it, the size of the database.",
        "So we have to look at this in terms of an iterative process, where as we grow, we acquire the requisite knowledge we need to go to the next phase.",
        "So, for example, you know right now there are lots of applications with biometrics and they have five or ten thousand users.",
        "Right.",
        "But there aren't a lot that have five hundred thousand users or five million users or fifty million users.",
        "And as we move through, we're going to find breaking points.",
        "So we have to think about rolling out the technology in a way where we anticipate that.",
        "Walter Hamilton, obviously that's a concern for the industry as well.",
        "It is a concern for the industry.",
        "Scalability is an important consideration in system engineering and designing applications to fit a specific mission that you're trying to accomplish in regards to the number of potential users of that application.",
        "But it's no different than any system design in information technology field.",
        "Biometrics is not unique, it's just a form of data, and it needs to be protected, and it needs to be used appropriately, and it also needs to be scaled in a way that it can be used responsibly so that the users receive immediate results.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Let's get some more callers on the line.",
        "We'll turn to Chris.",

        "I actually work in this industry here in the U.S.",
        "and our company does a lot of work with local city, county, and state governments concerning identification and tracking of personnel to emergency scenes and so on.",
        "The smart card, if I had a dollar for every time it was mentioned, I'd be retired at 30.",
        "And unfortunately the biggest problem is over the long haul, these programs are just not sustainable based on the grants that are being received at the local level from the Department of Homeland Security, and so on, further up the chain because the typical grant monies that folks are spending on this are between 10 and 20 thousand dollars at the local county and sometimes even state level, and you cannot sustain a program like this on those monies.",
        "And I guess the second point I would make, and one or two of your previous callers mentioned this, part of the problem the one caller had about having to have her passport still and that kind of thing by traveling to other countries is simply because Visa, the smart cards, and the biometrics are extremely proprietary.",
        "They really do not interoperate very well, unless you have a reader for a specific chip or from a specific company, and there's only a few manufacturers in the world.",
        "You're really going to run into some issues with inoperability and I think that's why you haven't seen this take off quite as well as you have is because of cost and inoperability.",
        "Maxine Most?",
        "Well, I think cost is definitely a factor and in terms of the way this thing has been funded from the government level, I think that's a strong case for actually going after the commercial side and making a compelling argument for return on investment.",
        "One of the gentleman that called earlier had mentioned that they were doing this for payroll and it was actually saving them money.",
        "I think that's a part of the process.",
        "I also think when we look at building these large cell government systems, whether it's a National ID or whether it's a passport, or you know there's talk of doing this in various interoperable driver's licenses in the United States with this Real ID Act, you have to think about, you're making a large investment up front, but what is the upside as you move, you know, through the kind of large scale deployment.",
        "What are you going to gain from it, where can you actually use this to save money?",
        "But there's no question, you know, large initial investments are required.",
        "As far as the interoperability, I think we're beginning to see some of that start to happen where previously the vendors were all trying to, you know, sort of maintain the proprietary status believing that was how they were going to be successful.",
        "Now what we're seeing is some of those vendors moving towards some interoperability.",
        "There's recently been a test where four or five major vendors had a particular type of fingerprint, or finger scan, a template, that was interoperable between their systems because they realized that they're not going to be successful unless they do provide that type of interoperability and...",
        "So, let me ask Walter Hamilton, are we close to industry standards, industry-wide standards?",
        "There's quite a bit of effort going on in this area and a lot of progress I'm very pleased to say.",
        "A lot of it's being driven by the U.S.",
        "Federal Government as well as International Standards organizations.",
        "I'll give you an example.",
        "the Federal Government is issuing a new positive identification, personal identification verification card to all Federal workers, employees, and contractors, and it will be interoperable between agencies and facilities using industry standards for the biometrics as well as for the smart card technology.",
        "And as those standards are embraced in large-scale deployments like that, they will trickle down to the commercial sector for sure.",
        "Some kids say - oh, are you real?",
        "And they pull on his beard.",
        "They pat his stomach.",
        "Then they checks his silky gray hair.",
        "This is the intention of Federal Government, but we are a long way from doing it.",
        "I have talked to many people in probably 10 or 15 government agencies, and while everyone agrees that it's a good idea and we should be doing that, creating a standard for all Federal employees and contractors, these folks are actually running into all these issues, cost, interoperability standards, so on and so forth.",
        "And so, I think we are making progress, but there's also much work to be done.",
        "And since these government agencies can't talk to their own computers back and forth, maybe this is not so surprising."

        "Well, iris recognition is the technology that would be applicable here and certainly, the prosthesis would not be usable for that technology since the natural iris would not be present.",
        "If you've had a corneal transplant or, or even wear contact lenses, if it's not obscuring the natural iris pattern, it should still be usable.",
        "Iris recognition is a very accurate technology.",
        "It does not use an intensive light source, like a laser, that some people may have seen from the Hollywood movies.",
        "It is a very benign way of sensing the pattern using near infrared visible light from a distance of about 18 inches.",
        "It's quite safe.",
        "And, and just as long as we're onto the movies, can the bad guy just grab the good guy's eyeball out of his head and stick it on a pencil and put it in front of the scanner?",
        "Not, no, I don't think so.",
        "Well, good, I'm glad that's not going to happen.",
        "Well, something else would be, how accurate would my eye, I can't hold it still and if someone at Safeway is trying to do this, not that they check ID too frequently, but, like, serious professionals have difficulty looking at my eye.",
        "That's a good point.",
        "Just to add that, in the early days of using iris recognition technology, the cameras did require the subject to pose and hold still for a moment or so, and now those cameras, because of advances in camera technology, are becoming so much faster that that type of posing, which is uncomfortable and may be a little difficult for some people in certain situations, is becoming less and less of a concern.",
        "Leslie, thanks for the call and good luck with the technology of the future.",
        "Thank you.",

        "Hi!",
        "Hi, how're you doing?",

        "It's a top secret center where we have to use biometrics, i.e., fingerprinting to get in, and I just want to talk about some of the problems that we've had with some of my fellow Marines that have problems, you know, something maybe be on their fingers or something like that.",
        "When we get in there, we have problems very often with, because they do all five fingers, getting into all five fingerprints all at the same time, and then when we get in, on our ID cards, if you do or do not know, they have fingerprints on the ID cards and you have to put that in there and if it does not, you slide your card into a reader and if it does not match the fingerprints that are on the ID card, then it won't let you in, and this is our daily job.",
        "And I just didn't know what kind of fine-tuning they may have done on anything like that with the biometrics because we use it everyday.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And does it seem to work pretty well, Allen?",
        "Say again?",
        "Does it seem to work pretty well?",
        "It seems to work, you know, most of the time.",
        "You just walk in there, you know, it'll be 6:30 in the morning and we're tired and we just kind of lay our fingers on there and it reads it most of the time, but we have had some issues, like big issues, and it may have been done at the point of origin where we put it on the card or whatever, but where people would try and try again, and try again, and they could never get it to match up with the fingerprints that were saved onto our Forteza key, the ID card, and so I didn't know if there was any advances in that or if, if that was just going to be the 10 percent of problems that you get with most anything that you do.",
        "Right.",
        "Maxine Most, I'm wondering if you can help Allen out, and obviously also, it would seem like people interested in security would be early adapters of this technology.",
        "I don't think right now they're going to be able to convince him to do it.",
        "Of course, he's got the sting of the loss fresh in his mind and now's probably not the time to do it.",
        "But they'll argue basically that this party that you've always loved, is going to be destroyed by your staying in the race, and that you're being selfish.",
        "And that, when you talk about John Kennedy and the history of the Democratic Party, it's that history that you're undoing by staying in the race.",
        "Yeah, I think there's a couple of issues.",
        "One is the issue of the initial enrollment.",
        "If that's not done properly, then individuals can have continued problems authenticating.",
        "So the first time you enroll, you're saying, okay, this is Maxine, the next time when I go to authenticate or verify, I'm saying, okay, is this the same Maxine that originally gave me the fingerprints?",
        "That's one issue.",
        "Another issue is, there are certain people that have certain problems with just specific biometrics.",
        "Your previous caller said, you know, she was concerned about her iris because of her eyes.",
        "One of the ways around this is to have multi-biometric systems where you'd use different biometrics because they don't always work that well for every individual.",
        "There, and the other issue, I think, also is that as with any emerging technology, you're continually seeing increases in performance and accuracy.",
        "There's always going to be an error, some margin of error, when you're dealing with a human-machine interface, but we will see as we go forward the level of performance continually increased because there are people that do nothing but sit in labs, trying to tweak the technology to get it better and better."
