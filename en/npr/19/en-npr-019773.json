        "Funny enough, none of the elevator professionals I talked to thought it was possible.",
        "So, there maybe some kind of conspiracy that we don't know about.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, thank you for answering my question, but it is a possibility in some locations?",
        "Oh, it works some places.",

        "Scott, thanks very much.",
        "You do write though, about the psychology of those controls on the elevator panel, that the designers are trying to give us the illusion that we are in control of this box that hurtles us up and down.",
        "Yeah, I guess people like control.",
        "The \"\"door close\"\" button, for example, does not work on elevators that are 20, or so, years old.",
        "I mean, elevators that have been introduced in the last 20 or so years, the \"\"door close\"\" building tends not to work - \"\"door close\"\" button tends not to work.",
        "So it's like a placebo.",
        "People just press it to make themselves feel better, and the fact is, the door eventually closes, so you think the \"\"door close\"\" button is working.",
        "Which, you know, is like a perfect placebo.",

        "And then there are all kinds of horrible things that happen when people try to get out of elevators that are sort of stuck between floors and then the elevator starts to move.",
        "People probably have heard some of those stories.",
        "There's the elevator's door opened and somebody steps in, and there is no elevator there.",
        "That tends to happen with some frequency and - so I'm told.",

        "My wife was stuck was stuck in an elevator for 45 minutes.",
        "The interesting, though probably not surprising aspect, was that the emergency phone in our elevator was pretty obviously connected to a call center in India.",
        "That's true, I think some of the emergency - you know, the elevator companies have an emergency protocol set up, so that your call goes to a - probably to India.",
        "So, I don't think that person is going to come save you, but maybe they have a mechanism in place to deploy someone else to come save you."
