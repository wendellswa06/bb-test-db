        "And more than once, I recall riding on top of an elevator with him and he would sort of watch the counterweights go by.",
        "And just sort of making sure everything was working the way it should.",
        "And, you know, of course, he was always very careful.",
        "Don't get anywhere near those pullies over there and don't touch these cables and don't touch this and don't touch that.",
        "It was a little bit scary, but it was also just a real thrill.",
        "And just, you know, just be able to say - you know, every time we watch \"\"Die Hard\"\" with my kids, I say, hey, guys, I rode on top of an elevator one time, you know.",
        "And bore them with stories and stuff like that.",
        "He also used to tell me stories about when he was installing elevators, how he was sometimes on the fly.",
        "On the construction site they would have to suddenly redesign the elevator to actually make it work.",
        "Because the architect would, you know, would - he would say, well, we are going to put an elevator here and it is going to look like this.",
        "And then the people actually installing it would say, well, but elevators don't really work that way.",
        "Explain to the architect and the engineers, no, you are going to need a second tract to keep it steady and odd little things like that.",
        "He's full of a lot of interesting stories about the elevator business.",
        "So this is kind of a walk down memory lane, listening to you guys talk about elevators.",

        "OK.",

        "How awkward is it that the Trump administration would like better relations with Russia, but at the same time, wants to take a harder line on Iran but those two countries are on the same side and in some cases pursuing similar interests to the United States?",
        "Well, U.S.",
        "policy is currently in conflict with itself because as you mentioned it's very difficult to have a co-operative approach towards Russia and a more - a policy which tries to contain and push back Iran...",

        "The reason that the president has said he would like warmer relations with Russia is to use them as an ally against ISIS.",
        "Iran says it's also against ISIS, and that's a place where the U.S.",
        "and Iran can make common cause.",
        "Do any American officials see it that way?",
        "I think the Trump administration's national security brain trust would see both Iran and Russia as two countries which on the surface are fighting ISIS, but in reality what they do actually fuels Sunni radicalism more than it eliminates it and that, you know, Iran and Russia - they're bombing a lot of Sunni civilian outposts and just Iran's role in the Middle East, Russia's role in the Middle East tends to anger Sunni communities more than allay them."
