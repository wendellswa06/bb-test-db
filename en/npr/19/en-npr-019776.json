        "One encouraging sign is that China agreed to a separate round of talks this week focused on maritime security, says Christopher Johnson, a China specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
        "I think the question will be whether they're here to tell us about, you know, their sovereignty and so on - in other words, to adopt a very inflexible position - or whether there's some room for dialogue.",

        "delegation will also have to wait and hear what China has to say about the recent discovery of a massive, sophisticated cyber hack into the U.S.",
