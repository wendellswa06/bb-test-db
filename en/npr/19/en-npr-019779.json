        "He also didn't actually go to Darfur.",
        "He said he couldn't protect witnesses in the ongoing conflict.",
        "Instead, his team of 24 investigators met with Sudanese officials in Khartum and with Darfuris abroad.",

        "You know, because in a racist kind way, it celebrates strength and resilience, but it also denies humanity as well.",
        "It does seem positive on its surface, and it's a different way that we can look at blacks as other than human that doesn't seem as nasty.",
        "But we show in our paper that it does have one negative consequence at least, and that's that the extent that people super-humanize blacks, they also perceive blacks to feel less pain than whites.",
