        "Roth directs the National Institute of Mental Health Psychoactive Drug Screening Program and his lab discovered how salvia divinorum interacts uniquely with the brain.",
        "He says it affects users very differently than LSD or any other hallucinogenic drug.",
        "And, in essence, what happens when users take a sufficient dose is that they're transported nearly instantaneously to an alternative universe, a different place and time.",
        "And frequently they have no memory actually of having ingested a drug.",
        "Roth says the dream-like or visionary experience is too intense and not enjoyable for many first-time users.",
        "Another expert on salvia, Daniel Siebert, who has grown, researched, sold and used the herb himself, agrees salvia is not for everyone.",
        "Most people who do it hoping to just have a interesting high find it confusing and disappointing.",

        "But he too is concerned about the way it's being marketed on some web sites and in some shops misleading as producing marijuana-like affects.",
        "Siebert says salvia appeals to people he calls spiritual seekers who use it in meditation.",
        "He calls it an extraordinary tool for delving into one's psyche and as a way to find a greater internal sense of awareness.",
        "That's closer to the traditional use of this type of sage, which is found naturally in the mountains of the Ohaka region of southern Mexico, where the Mazatec Indians used it for centuries to divine the spirits in religious ceremonies and for medicinal purposes.",
        "The effects of salvia don't last long.",
        "The most intense trips last no more than 15 minutes and the full effects wear off after about an hour.",
        "Though not conclusive, Roth says preliminary research finds Salvia does not appear to be addictive nor toxic, but he says there may be at least one negative side effect.",
        "There is good reason to suspect, from animal studies which have been done with this and related compounds, that it may cause a depressive-like experience or syndrome in individuals.",
        "Roth cannot say conclusively that Salvia use leads to depression in humans, but he and other salvia researchers report anecdotal evidence.",
        "And some Salvia users themselves say they've felt depressed after taking salvia, some for a period of days.",
        "Kathy Chitister (ph) of Wilmington, Delaware believes salvia may have affected her 17-year-old son Brett in that way.",
        "She says a relative told her last August that Brett was using salvia and after reading up on it on the internet, she confronted him.",
        "And I asked him to please stop.",
        "The bag that I found, I dumped that down the toilet.",
        "And he had said at that point that he would not do it anymore."

        "And she says she also found an essay he'd written about his salvia experiences on his computer.",
