        "Tell me about this band that we're listening to right now.",
        "This is a group called Frente Cumbiero, which sort of loosely translates as the front cumbia group.",
        "They're from Bogota, the capital of Colombia, and their name is sort of a play on the idea that the band is sort of building a front for cumbia or on behalf of cumbia, which is a style of music native to Colombia.",
        "It's pretty much the most popular dance music in every country but Colombia.",
        "And you might wonder why.",
        "Well, in the '70s when salsa and vallenato - the accordion-based music of Colombia - took over, cumbia sort of died down.",

        "So, Betto, this song is called \"\"Zapata Se Queda.\"\" And this song is actually about Emiliano Zapata, the Mexican revolutionary, right?",
        "Correct.",
        "It's a song off her new album \"\"Pecados y Milagros\"\" or \"\"Sins and Miracles.\"\" And Lila told me in an interview recently that this song came about because she was having these sort these recurrent dreams.",
        "And she was waking up in the middle of the night, and she would sort of see the ghost of Zapata.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"\"ZAPATA SE QUEDA\"\")",
        "So she wrote a song inspired by Zapata.",
        "But the song is also about what's happening in Mexico today.",
        "This is a song that has to do with this sort of, as she calls it, kind of the Wild West of Mexico that's going on right now with the violence where people are using firearms like it's a movie or something.",
        "And she's sort of singing this as a call to get good visionary leadership, like Zapata, to help the country in this time of need.",

        "It's a group of musicians from Peru who are interfusing hip, electronic dance music with traditional Afro-Peruvian music.",
        "Much like the first group Frente Cumbiero, who are sort of reinterpreting the traditional cumbia of Colombia, Novalima are bringing Afro-Peruvian music into the 21st century, blending it with dance styles and electronica.",
        "And what I really like about this group is that they managed to keep the roots of the music intact.",
        "They're not really messing with the beat and the rhythm.",
        "They're adding to it color and texture.",

        "Let's begin with the new plan to deal with the toxic assets.",
        "What can you tell us about that?",
        "Well, Renee, basically it's an effort to create a market for those assets, those big bundles of bad mortgages.",
        "We haven't had that until now, largely because people haven't had any idea what those assets are worth.",
        "There was no way to put a price on them.",
        "The market was just frozen because banks didn't want to give them away, but buyers, on the other hand, worried they would pay too much for them.",

        "So what the government here is trying to do is get a market started in these securities with private investors bidding on the assets.",
        "The program actually has three parts to it, but the plan is essentially to take some of the risk out.",
        "The government will put up a lot of the money in partnership with these investors and it'll also guarantee against a big portion of the potential losses that investors could face.",
        "And the hope is that maybe this way you could actually kick-start the market, just get some bidding going, actually see some of these assets purchased and thereby get some prices attached to them.",
        "So we'll have an idea what they're actually worth.",
        "The government couldn't establish this market just by buying them on its own, Renee, because there wouldn't be any competition, the price would be just arbitrary.",
        "But private investors weren't doing it on their own, because it seemed too risky, maybe with this public/private partnership, we could actually see buying and selling and get these assets finally off the banks' balance sheets.",
        "Does the private sector seem to like this idea?",
        "Well, initially, yes.",
        "However, you mentioned this tax that Congress is considering on bonuses and that has somewhat complicated things.",
        "We've already had some Wall Street folks saying they're not inclined to sign up as investment partners with the government if there's a possibility that Congress might decide down the road to change the rules, and let's say, tax any profits that come out of this venture.",
