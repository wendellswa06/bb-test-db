        "So I think it is inevitable that there will be difficulty in getting a dramatically different plan enacted.",
        "The thing that really bothers me is that here we are at a point after two wars, about a trillion dollars and major tax cuts and, frankly, some of the Republicans still talking about no tax increase for the top two percent, the partisan wrangling really hasn't stopped.",
        "And so I think we may have to trim down our goals a bit and, still, do something significant.",
        "I don't think that's impossible.",
        "But something huge like the co-chairs put on the table yesterday, there's no one on the commission right now that would support that.",

        "He says managers felt pressured to lie about the plant's pollution.",
        "For example, they did not tell regulators when they had power outages that shut down the plant's exhaust system and sent lots of toxic gases into the air.",
        "Because that's supposed to be documented in a quarterly report to the EPA, that I used to have to sign and we would have power failures and wouldn't report them.",

        "Snyder started talking to a few leaders of the Clean Air Coalition.",
        "He secretly gave them information about dirty operations and equipment failures that he got from inside the plant.",
        "And actually, I still maintain a relationship with a couple guys there.",
        "The group used this information to push the state to act.",
        "Finally, in April of 2009, experts from the state and the federal EPA swooped in on Tonawanda Coke for a weeklong surprise inspection.",
        "According to government reports, they found lots of benzene seeping from equipment in disrepair.",
