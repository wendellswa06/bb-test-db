        "Harris is a sociology professor at the University of Washington.",
        "And she's just written a book about how, across the country, court fines and fees are used more and more to fund government but fall heavily on the poorest people.",
        "They should not be charged for the city government services.",
        "They should not be seen as a revenue-generating entity if they are poor.",
        "Each fee may not seem like a lot.",

        "Plus, they're on top of court fines, which in Ferguson typically run a few hundred or even a thousand dollars.",
        "And we're talking about low-level, nonviolent offenses - mostly traffic violations or jumping on the light rail public transportation without paying for a ticket.",
        "Ferguson collected $2.6 million dollars in court fines and fees last year.",
        "That was the city's second-largest source of income, or about 21 percent of its total budget.",
        "The city council's proposals last night could end some of those fees.",
        "Council members said they wanted to make it clear that the city is not imposing fines to harass residents or to finance the city government, but attorney Thomas Harvey says that's how it feels to people who took to the streets to protest in Ferguson.",
        "Every reporter I've talked to who came here said that either the second or third thing that people told them at the protest was about interaction with the police force and the courts.",
        "And they said it wasn't like they asked some kind of hard-hitting journalistic question, you know?",

        "Last month, his group released a report that singled out Ferguson and showed why people hate those court costs - because if they don't pay, they can go to jail.",
        "And the municipal court issued a lot of arrest warrants.",
        "Last year, the city, with a population of 21,000, issued nearly 33,000 arrest warrants on traffic violations and other minor offenses.",
        "For Harvey, the council's steps to start cutting back fees was reason for hope and skepticism, too.",
        "Frankly, as great as this first step is, there's nothing in that proposal that discusses how they're going to address the disproportionate stopping off African-Americans in their community.",
        "Numbers from Missouri's attorney general counted vehicle stops in Ferguson.",
        "Blacks are far more likely to be stopped than whites, far more likely to be searched and twice as likely to be arrested even though whites are more likely to be caught with contraband.",
        "Still, the fact that it's Ferguson of all places that's taking first steps to limit the use of fines and fees is cause for some optimism that one day, this city will be seen as a place that became a national model for how to change court fees that target the poor.",

        "So if girls are starting breast development two or three years earlier than they were 40 or 50 years ago, of course, that gives them that many more years of exposure to estrogen.",
