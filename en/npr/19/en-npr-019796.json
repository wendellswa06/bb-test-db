        "Let's get to the showdown, the OPEC summit in Doha in 1976.",
        "What do these previously classified papers tell us about this moment that we didn't know before?",
        "We now know that in the months leading up to the summit, President Ford and his advisers reached out to the most powerful members of OPEC: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela.",
        "And they said, look, the global financial system has reached the brink.",
        "We could have banking failures.",
        "We could have the collapse of governments in Western Europe.",
        "And Ford was asking them to restrain their desire to increase oil prices again at Doha.",
        "And the shah basically said to Ford, look, you know, I've already passed over one oil price increase this year because it's your election.",
        "And I can't do it again, because my economy's in trouble.",
        "And so, what happened then that would deal Iran out and make the Saudis the new staunch American ally?",
        "The Saudis cut a deal with the Ford administration.",
        "They then went for broke in Doha.",
        "And they in fact told the rest of the OPEC members, you raise oil prices if you want to.",
        "We're not only going to undercut you and sell our oil at a cheaper price, we're going to try and flood the market.",
        "Now this is a very dramatic moment in the history of OPEC.",
        "And in fact what it did was it threw the international oil markets into turbulence for the next six months.",
        "And this is really the period when we see a fiscal crisis emerging in Iran.",
        "You call this a Pyrrhic victory for the Americans because in your view it helped lead to the overthrow of the shah.",
        "You also make a parallel between the shah in the 1970s and the conduct of Iranian President Ahmadinejad today when it comes to how he gambles or bets with his own economic policies.",
        "Yes, I'm fascinated by the parallels.",
        "We have an Iranian leader who's enjoyed vast Iranian oil revenues.",
        "And he has chosen to pump all those petrodollars back into the Iranian economy.",
        "And economies are very fragile things.",
        "They have to be able to absorb billions of dollars of surplus petrodollars.",
        "And so, right now in Iran you're seeing inflation at about 30 percent.",
        "You're seeing double-digit levels of unemployment.",
        "You're seeing a vast budget deficit.",
        "So 30 years later, the U.S.",
        "and Iran are still hostages to the fortunes of the international oil markets, and there is a particular irony in that position.",
        "Andrew Scott Cooper, his article is called \"\"Showdown at Doha: The Secret Oil Deal That Helped Sink the Shah of Iran.\"\" It's in the new issue of the Middle East Journal.",

        "But people didn't see it.",
        "They'd get to the end and say, I thought I'd qualify for some, and I didn't.",
        "Why is that?",
        "And we'd go back and look in the application and they had missed it.",
        "Web designers eliminated the check box and made that fork in the road much more clear-cut for applicants.",
        "New York's exchange has been running relatively smoothly, compared with the federal one.",
        "But almost every day still brings complaints about long wait times for calls and serious glitches online.",
        "Frescatore says there are no serious patterns of trouble, just individual issues that the state and its contractors address one by one.",
        "We try to listen to everything - to social media, to customer service, to our navigators, and work every day to make it better.",
        "The bigger, more abstract challenge is trying to adjust people's expectations - not over how quickly web pages should open, but over what it means to shop for health insurance online, where people have been told...",
        "You can compare insurance plans side by side, the same way you'd shop for a plane ticket on Kayak or a TV on Amazon.",
        "That's what President Obama said on October 1st, and it's a description state and federal officials and politicians put out there for months, if not years, before the exchange rollout - much to the chagrin of contractor Chris Harmer.",
        "I don't think it's the correct analogy for a marketplace."
