        "And what is going to be in it to justify the gigantic expense of all of this?",
        "Well, who says it's gigantic expense?",
        "We're establishing a transportation system that we use over and over and over and over again, instead of something leaving the Earth with all the things you need en route and what you're going to need there, and then do it again, build it all again.",
        "You don't want to do that.",
        "You want to reuse things.",
        "You want to have a system that swings by the Earth, and you join up with it as it swings by, and maybe all you need to do is to join up with a Mars lander.",
        "Your radiation, your habitation, your communications, your long-term life support is onboard the cycling spaceship.",
        "And you make use of it, and five, six months later, you approach Mars, you separate the lander, and you make a landing.",
        "And the cycler keeps going around.",
        "Now, I developed a cycler that came back to where it started from, in 1985.",
        "To my knowledge, nobody had done that before.",
        "They'd used gravity assist to swing by Jupiter and then go to another planet, use gravity assist there and keep going on and on.",
        "But until I decided, starting at the moon, that I knew when we left the Earth, we could be on a free-return trajectory, which meant that we left the Earth, and we'd circle around the moon and come back to the Earth.",
        "All right?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Now, when you come back to the Earth, if you swing around the Earth and then go back out again, that's possible, isn't it?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Sure it is.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, it just so happens, the moon isn't going to be there.",
        "It's going to be about a third of the way around.",
        "So you do that twice.",
        "I mean, it takes seven days to go around the moon and back.",
        "Now, two 10-day orbits, and then another seven, that's a cycling orbit.",
        "There are many other examples of a way to make that happen.",
        "Now, it happens that if you're interested in leaving the surface of the Earth to get to the surface of the moon, maybe a better way is the way John Houbolt came up with, and that's segmenting the missions into its necessary parts, not the way Dr. von Braun wanted to go to the moon, with a multipurpose crew vehicle that did everything.",
        "Yeah, one gigantic rocket."

        "If you - yeah, and that rocket wouldn't be ready, so we had to use two Saturn Vs and Earth-orbit rendezvous.",
        "So, the same kind of segmented approach to a transportation system for Earth-moon-Mars, and the moons of Mars, as well.",
        "Well, but the commercial - the tourism people are the ones that are going to use an Earth-moon cycling system so that they can swing people by the front side or the back side.",
        "All they need to do is to join up with a cycler as it swings by the Earth.",
        "And there's going to be enough interest in space tourism to generate the kind of income to pay for that?",

        "There's an organization called Golden Spike that is going to land people on the moon.",

        "What are you going to use to get there?",
        "How are you going to get there?",
        "Well, the way that - you're not going to find that many billionaires, but if I understand what they do, they're interested in the countries that do not have a space program.",
        "They would like to have a role model that that country can afford to send to the surface of the moon.",
        "Doesn't that make sense?",
        "It makes sense to me.",

        "I don't see the government wanting to do that.",
        "We already did that with big rockets and landers that landed people on the moon, and we ruled space at that time.",
        "Are we ruling space in the future?",
        "No. We can't even take our own astronauts to our $100 billion space station.",
        "Why?",
        "Because the program to replace the shuttle in seven years didn't pan out.",
        "It wasn't the president's fault.",
        "He set forth a reasonable program to do what the accident board said, retire the orbiter at the end of 2010.",
        "The president said the same thing.",
        "President Obama added two more missions, but he essentially did the same thing.",
        "But because the program was not implemented correctly, we didn't have a rocket for the spacecraft, and we didn't have a big, heavy rocket for the rest of it."

        "You intercept it, wherever the moon happens to be; you don't care.",
        "It swings by the Earth, and you intercept it, and you ride that cycling system, which in my version consists of two interplanetary vehicles, side by side, connected for their redundancy.",
        "And if you need to, you can join up another one and make it three.",
        "And what would power that cycler?",
        "What would power it?",
        "The gravity assist.",
        "Once you get it in motion, you just need to trim it a little bit and keep it on its navigable course, and it keeps going.",
        "It does not need propulsion once it gets underway.",
        "Now, my initial discovery of this was back in 1985, and since the Earth catches up with the moon every 26 months after - I'm sorry, catches up with Mars every 26 months, Mars has made one revolution and a little bit, two months' worth, and the Earth has made two revolutions, catching up with Mars at the right point.",
        "And when it does that, the cycler swings by the Earth and heads toward Mars, getting there in five to six months.",
        "It then swings by Mars, and the original cycler to happen during one cycle period of 26 months proceeds on outward and comes back to the Earth in 21 months, at just the right angle, just the right speed and altitude to swing by the Earth, and the Earth bends its orbit back to Mars again.",
        "And it keeps doing this time and after time.",
        "Now, we've made some improvements on this through the Purdue University and some of the graduate students, but the cycle of swinging by one planet, then another, then back to the other one, this particular improvement doesn't bring it back right away.",
        "It brings it back for the one after that opportunity.",
        "So you have an opportunity with two cyclers to go on the first, third, fifth, seventh opportunities.",
        "And it takes more time in between, and with that more time, your swing-bys at Earth and Mars are much, much less fuel required to get on and to get off.",
        "And besides, you have another swing-by of the Earth for replenishment of supplies on the cycler, without putting people on or off.",
        "And a year and a half later, it comes by again, and makes the transit of five to six months to Mars."
