        "Is there some sort of way that we can intertie planetary security against comets and asteroids with your system, as well?",
        "And I'll take your answer off the call, or off the air.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "You do mention this in the book, but after Chelyabinsk and the meteor that hit there, that's certainly revived people's interest in being - having the capability of deflecting, maybe, some asteroids.",
        "The key to it is knowing what is where and how is it moving, what is its future path going to be?",
        "And we're going to get better and better doing that.",
        "That is a tracking demand.",
        "And the better our telescopes and other things are in tracking, the more lead time we will have.",

        "There's a system of solar dynamic which reflects the incoming rays of the sun on a specific point that gets very hot.",
        "We circulate fluid through that point or focal point, and we use the coldness of reflected - reflectors that go in the opposite direction of the sun.",
        "And from these differences, we use a particular thermodynamic cycle.",
        "And if I could explain it, I'm not sure I or you would understand, but it does work to produce electricity.",
        "And I believe - from what I'm told and what people who are developing these things - this will become much more efficient for supplying power as long as you're in a close vicinity of the sun.",
        "Now, certainly Mars is one and a half times further away from the sun than the Earth is.",
        "It may turn out that nuclear energy is needed.",
        "The way to get these supplies to the base on Mars is to assemble them robotically from a position close by.",
        "Now, the reason I say that is about - over 10 years ago, we had two spacecraft, Spirit and Opportunity, on opposite sides of Mars.",
        "They were supposed to last 90 days.",
        "The first one kind of stopped moving after five years, and the other one is still operating."

        "I want to emphasize the importance of getting human intelligence close to where the critical robots are that you're trying to assemble.",
        "Even from the Earth, to assemble something at the moon with a second-and-a-half time delay and a second and a half to come back again, it is preferable to have something where the neutral points of gravity between Earth and Mars exist on the far side, about 50,000 miles.",
        "The Lagrange points.",

        "So since we're interested in the dark craters that receive no sunlight on the far side south pole - the Aitken basin and Shackleton crater - it gets extremely cold in some area that never sees sunlight, 20, 40 degrees from absolute zero, Kelvin.",
        "That's the coldest spot, so I'm told, in the entire solar system.",
