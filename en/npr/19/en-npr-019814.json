        "Imagine Hurricane Harvey starts in the Gulf of Mexico and blows across Texas.",
        "So the way I would think about it is that the buildings stopped the air from being able to move forwards, away from the ocean, through the grasslands that would've been there if Houston hadn't been built, and further into Texas.",
        "They sort of stopped the air in that general area.",
        "And the air has nowhere to go but either around the buildings or up.",
        "The buildings force extra air up into the colder parts of the atmosphere, and that generates more rain because the air coming from the Gulf of Mexico is hot and moist.",
        "When moist air touches a cold surface or is in contact with cold, it will tend to form droplets, as the water does on the outside of a glass.",
