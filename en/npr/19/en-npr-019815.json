        "They were beautiful photos, too, dating from the early to mid-20th century but they carried no identifying information.",
        "Now, that might sound like a pretty simple solution, but changing their calls to cope with a noisy environment is actually quite extraordinary for frogs.",
        "And while the males have figured out how to make themselves heard above the noise of the city, Dr. Parris says it may not be what the females are looking for.",
        "When females have a choice between two males calling, they tend to select the one that calls at a lower frequency because, in frogs, the frequency of a call is related to body size.",

        "At the moment, they only cover about four percent of the Earth's terrestrial surface.",
