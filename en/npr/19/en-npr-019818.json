        "So I'm actually in - well, I just finished my freshman year, and then I'm kind of - have been taking over 14 courses since the beginning of the year for a total of 32 towards the end of the year and...",

        "I got a website called Degree of Freedom where I'm sort of doing daily analysis of kind of the different things I'm learning from the experience.",
        "Because, you know, like you, I definitely felt that things like the discussion groups could vary quickly, sort of - the conversation could dissipate.",
        "But at the same time, if you find a sort of smaller cohort of students that you can interact with, that seems to be successful for some people to kind of create their own smaller communities.",
        "So, Jonathan, what was your biggest surprise in this immersion project of yours?",
        "Well, I would say, you know, the biggest one is really that if you are a self-motivated learner, meaning, you know, you're going to - even though you know you can the same grade on a paper by putting one hour into it, you know, versus putting three, that if you put the three into it to really kind of teach yourself something while you're writing or, you know, its (unintelligible) do the reading, make sure you'll slowly listen to the lecturers.",
        "Take notes, you know?",
        "Go through it like it's, you know, as rigorous a learning experience.",
        "You can get as much as you could out of an actual college class.",
        "I think the high dropout rates that people talk about are really, you know, there's a lot of reasons for them, but I think that a lot of it is because some people sign up not realizing, hey, this really is a college class with, you know, that same level demand.",
        "And if you bring the right mindset to it, then you can really get, you know, as much out of it as you put into it.",

        "Where they should be used for college credit are courses like sociology, political science, history where you have engineering students at the University of Texas - why are they paying $2,000 in credit or whatever it is to pay through sociology class when it has nothing to do with their major?",
        "They just need it to fulfill a requirement.",
        "So I think that's the reason why we have so much debt in America.",
        "And if students can be funneled to a course like through Coursera or a MOOC where that MOOC - where they can take that sociology class, you know, get that credit for 150 bucks or whatever they're charging, I mean, that can really save a lot of money for students.",
        "And it's just ridiculous that, you know, you're not going to remember anything from your sociology class 10 years later.",

        "It's so hard to predict what that impact will be.",
        "I think it will be overall good, especially because it allows people all over the world who don't have a lot of resources to get access to education.",
