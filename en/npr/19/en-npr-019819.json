        "Tell us about this starfish that seems to be a voracious predator there.",
        "Well, crown-of-thorn starfish are found across much of the Pacific Ocean and Indian Oceans.",
        "They are - they're about dinner-plate size, multiple arms, have little thorn-like spines coming out of them.",
        "They're also quite venomous.",
        "So the last thing you want to do is touch one and have it prick you, and it can cause paralysis.",
        "But the important part for the corals is that these things are wonderful eating machines.",
        "They move slowly across the reef.",
        "They actually invert their stomach onto the corals and dissolve the coral tissue, you know, digesting it as they go.",
        "And they leave (technical difficulties) white behind them as they move forward.",
        "So they're like little bulldozers.",
        "Yeah, it's sort of like bulldozers.",
        "It's almost more like having a wave of people with flamethrowers going through the brush.",
        "You know, the coral physically is left behind, but it's all dead.",
        "Do they have any natural enemies that might, you know, come out and eat them?",
        "They do, but they won't help much in this case.",
        "There's a type of snail that eats them that unfortunately is also popular in the curio trade, but their numbers were never huge.",
        "There's some - actually some very small shrimp that will eat them, but, you know, there's only so much they can do.",
        "When you have these outbreaks, the numbers of starfish are so much that it's beyond what any of their predators can do anything about.",
        "And these are not your run-of-the-mill, see-them-on-the-beach five-legged starfish, are they?",
        "No, no, I mean, they look like monsters.",
        "If you wanted to - you know, if you were to blow one of these things up really big, you could use it in a sci-fi movie."

        "No kidding?",
        "It's that ferocious-looking?",
        "They look nasty.",
        "I mean, they're not your, as you say, your friendly hang-on-the-wall starfish.",
        "This is a thorny-looking, multi-armed feeding machine.",
        "So if they don't have any natural enemies that can decrease their population, what can you do about them?",
        "Well, this is really getting at the question not just for the starfish but for what you can do for coral reefs.",
        "So we've been working, in fact, with the Australians for a while, dealing with the issues of resilience to climate change.",
        "And the two things we need to do is we really need to deal with those local stresses to coral reefs to make the reefs healthier so that while we're working on solving the climate change issues, reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere - we're already at too high a level.",
        "So getting that down, getting it to the point that bleaching isn't such a problem, we've got to do that, but in the meantime we've got to take care of the local threats.",
        "Well, what they're looking at in Australia, because they've got really these issues of climate change, bleaching, they've got cyclones that are always a problem for coral reefs, it's a natural problem, they're looking at two things.",
        "One is perhaps going out and manually finding ways to remove or kill the crown-of-thorn sea stars.",
        "You don't chop them up into little pieces, though, because like any starfish, you cut them up into little pieces, you get more of them.",
        "So you've got to find something to kill them, remove them.",
        "My mom will tell me that before she goes to bed, she'll check it.",
        "And if she sees everyone up at home, then she knows we're all either in bed or in a dorm, and it's a nice little comforting thing.",
        "Trey Bagley, he's a designer of a real life Weasley clock.",
        "Thanks so much for talking with us, Trey."

        "Thank you.",
        "Now to Brooklyn, N.Y., where vivid details of the infamous Sinaloa drug cartel's day-to-day operations have been coming to light in the courtroom.",
        "You might remember that Joaquin El Chapo Guzman has been on trial since November 14.",
        "He's facing 17 charges, including drug trafficking, money laundering, conspiracy to murder rivals and firearms violations to name just a few.",
        "Witnesses have been providing a look into one of the world's largest drug-trafficking organizations.",
        "The trial took a break for the Christmas and New Year's holidays but started up again this week and jumped right back in with insider testimony from a so-called cartel prince.",
        "Alan Feuer has been covering the trial for The New York Times, where he reports on courts and criminal justice.",
        "And he's with us now.",
        "Alan Feuer, thanks so much for talking to us.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "So just to backtrack a little bit for people who have not been following this story, how much of the operations of this kind of infamous drug cartel are coming to light in this trial?",
        "Everything is coming out, Michel.",
        "This is really the first time that we've seen what the American government knows about the full operations of the Sinaloa drug cartel.",
        "And this is all coming out not just through a vast amount of documents and photographs and recorded phone calls and drug ledgers, but by an incredible cast of witnesses from within the cartel, people who worked for many years with Chapo Guzman.",
        "And this week, the trial resumed with what had to have been just a very explosive witness.",
        "It was Vicente Zambada Niebla.",
        "You called him a cartel prince in your report because he's the son of El Chapo's former partner in the cartel.",
        "What are some of the things that we learned from his testimony?",
        "I mean, we learned everything from the fact that his father, Mayo Zambada, Chapo's partner, regularly had a monthly bribery budget of $1 million - I'll say it again, that's monthly - to pay off corrupt officials in Mexico.",
        "We learned how the cartel used submarines to smuggle drugs up from Colombia to Mexico.",
        "We learned that they then crossed those drugs into the United States in everything from trains with secret compartments to tractor trailers where the drugs were stuffed in between pallets of frozen meat.",
        "He took the jury through virtually every aspect not only of the cartel's operations but even down to the level of its kind of petty politics and personal vendettas.",
        "You know, one of the things I was struck by in your report was how you described Zambada as smirking at Guzman and having an air of, quote, \"\"bravura\"\" on the witness stand.",
        "And the reason I'm struck by that is I think many people will remember that Guzman has previously escaped prison a number of times, the fact that this cartel is known for being, I don't know how else to put it, murderous.",
        "What do you make of his - is it eagerness to testify or his confidence in testifying?",
        "I was just wondering what you make of it.",
        "It was a remarkable moment.",
        "He got onto the witness stand, and within seconds of sitting down, he looked over at Chapo.",
        "And he kind of raised his head, put a big smile on his face and nodded kind of in this like cocky gesture that said partly hello old friend to, you know, like, got you now.",
        "Hard to know.",
        "But to your point, yes, I mean, Chapo did escape twice from prison in Mexico, famously once in a laundry cart, once through a tunnel that his associates dug literally into the shower of his cell in prison.",
        "And so there's been a lot of concern on the part of the authorities here in New York to prevent that from happening again."

        "You've been covering courts of criminal justice for 20 years.",
        "Just as briefly as you can, how would you compare this to other trials that you've covered?",
        "Well, I mean, this one is more than most a really, truly immersive experience.",
        "Part of that is just the logistics involved because of the intense security and because of the number of reporters who are covering the trial.",
        "We all have to get there by 6:30 in the morning to be assured of a seat inside of the courtroom.",
        "It's a very challenging atmosphere in which to work.",
        "I mean, there's a team of drug-sniffing dogs.",
        "There are police snipers deployed around the courthouse.",
        "And there's even - I have never seen this one before - there's a federal marshal with some sort of like radiation sensor who goes through the floor - not just the courtroom itself, but the entire floor - making sure there's no radiological devices.",
        "That's remarkable.",
        "So before we let you go, what do you expect in the next days and weeks?",
        "How much longer do you expect this to go on?",
        "Well, it's definitely going to go for, I would guess, at least another month.",
        "And what we can expect is more sort of ghosts from El Chapo's past to appear in the courtroom and testify against him.",

        "Let me ask you about money and the month of January, because there are new reports out today on campaign fundraising.",
        "They show both Democrats ahead of Senator McCain, though he was really just starting to pick up a head of steam in January, and among the Democrats Senator Obama raising three times as much as Senator Clinton did in January.",
        "The numbers on the Democratic side are very interesting, and they tell the story of the larger narrative that we've seen, which is that Senator Obama has done well, he's raised more money, and he's managed it more wisely, and Senator Clinton has a lot of debt.",
        "She ended January with $7.6 million in debt, which doesn't include the $5 million personal loan she gave herself.",
        "There's certainly grumbling among Democratic strategists not aligned with either campaign about how the money flies out of the Clinton campaign and exactly where it all goes, and I suspect when we look back on this campaign, someone will write a very smart story about the way in which resources were allocated in the Clinton campaign."

        "No, it is not law.",
        "It is the interpretation of a 1997 court decision that does address what you do with people when they approach the border.",

        "They are going to take up immigration next week.",
        "It would address families at the border.",

        "If they are detained, they could not be separated, or a child would have to stay with at least one parent.",
        "It's tucked into a broader immigration bill that's going to attempt to address legal status for people who are brought here as children, include money for a border wall, restrict legal immigration.",
        "The question is we don't know if it will pass.",
        "And if it doesn't pass, then the onus goes back to the Trump administration to either continue this policy or stop it, which they do have the authority to do.",

        "And where this policy actually has broad support to change in Congress might just get bogged down in this broader, intractable immigration debate, particularly over the question of, do you ever provide a path to citizenship for people that are residing here in the country illegally?",
        "So if it doesn't pass, it's more because it will fall victim to a broader immigration debate, not because Congress thinks families should be separated at the border.",
