        "But at the same time, the other big thing they're doing in Australia is looking at improving water quality because there has been an indication, absolute proof isn't there yet, but a real strong indication that poor water quality, especially high nutrients, can lead to more sea stars.",
        "So you can lead to these big outbreaks that they're having.",
        "So they're looking at going out and removing them, improving their water quality, which is a win-win situation no matter what happens, you know, cleaner water on the reefs is good.",
        "And at the same time, of course they like everyone else are looking at what we can do to resolve some of the issues where climate change is going to be so important to reefs in the long term.",
        "Obviously there's some niche that the starfish occupy.",
        "Should we be worried if - what we might do to the ecosystem if we get rid of these starfish?",
        "You know, I think it would only be in the dreams of a few people that they might possibly be able to get rid of all of them.",
        "What they're trying to do is cut back on the numbers.",
        "So they're going to remove as many as they can, but you're still going to have some out there.",
        "And these sea stars are out there on a lot of reefs in the Pacific in low numbers.",
        "You can see little trails of white, dead corals that they've left behind as they've gone along feeding, and that will continue to happen.",
        "They're not going to get rid of every last one of them."

        "But the increase in numbers, I mean, you're talking about going onto reefs and having hundreds to thousands times as many starfish on a reef as you normally would see, and that's a big difference.",
        "Yeah, and you think of some of the runoff that might be coming onto the reef.",
        "There's a lot of evidence that it is.",
        "The smoking gun hasn't been found yet, but there's a lot to think that the runoff may be contributing to this.",
        "We're definitely - the Australian data show that they're seeing more frequent outbreaks of these sea stars in recent decades, and they think that especially nutrients but other parts of runoff may be to blame.",
        "If you can get them - get the die-off under control, how much of a recovery could we expect from the reef system?",
        "Well, you know, that's one of the nice things that this study did is they actually found that you - if you were to remove the damage from the crown-of-thorn starfish that they would be seeing a one-percent increase in coral cover per year.",
        "Remember what we're talking about on these reefs is the overall Great Barrier Reef has dropped from somewhere around 30 percent to somewhere around 15 percent over the last 27 years.",
        "So if you turn that around, and you had it going up by just one percent a year, that would be significant.",
        "And so yeah, we could see some recovery.",
        "It's a decadal-scale recovery, unfortunately, but yeah, we could see a recovery if that problem were eliminated but only, again, as bleaching becomes more of a problem, and we see more corals dying from high temperatures, we've got to deal with that issue, or removing the starfish won't be enough.",

        "Well, the court said that there is no definitive - well, Justice Roberts said that if since we are in a country that has death penalty and 36 dates have the death penalty, we have to have some way of using it and the lethal injection is the best way at this point.",
        "You know, we've gone from you know the firing squad to hanging to electric chair and at this point, he has ruled and the court has ruled that the lethal injection is the best method that we have so far for using the death penalty.",
