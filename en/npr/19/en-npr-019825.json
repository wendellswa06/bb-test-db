        "He also had me write out his alimony checks to his two ex-wives.",

        "Mr. BRUCE DIXON (Blackagendareport.com) I think it very much impacts what people think about the fairness of the justice system itself.",
        "It's almost as though these conservative legal theorists just wrote themselves a note to the teachers using their own absence and allowing them to do what they are going to do anyway.",
        "It just magnifies the experience of the law for ordinary people as being something capricious and unjust and whatever these guys say they want it to be.",
        "Now, across the board, states like California, Florida, and Virginia are planning on resuming executions, but other states are reexamining the death penalty for different reasons.",
        "For example in 2006, New Jersey put a moratorium on the death penalty because of questions around issues including exoneration of prisoners who were found to be innocent and potential, racial, and economic bias.",
        "So, Chandra where do you think the death penalty debates stands on a broader level?",
        "I think that the issue of the three-drug cocktail is an interesting issue, but I feel particularly here in Atlanta and across the country, I'm a facilitator of a discussion group called Talk Black and the sense that I've gotten while talking with my colleagues is that we are more concerned about the disparities in the death penalty, and how it is swayed toward African-American and other people of color and particularly when it is a crime committed against a Caucasian, and I feel that that's the issue that most people want to talk about.",
        "Bruce, some folks look at - this is not strictly a black and white issue there have been shown to be, Chandra was saying, that the people most likely to get the chair are blacks who commit crimes against whites, but some folks look at the broader civil rights issue and say why are civil rights leaders always defending black criminals instead of focusing on everyday working people who don't commit crimes.",
        "Is there a question of whether or not there is a backlash against really examining these issues that have to do with crime as opposed to dealing more with other issues.",
        "Well, in this era where people are so fond of saying that we're beyond race and that racial distinctions and racialism is behind this that just doesn't match up with the facts.",
        "The federal government, the White House, the task force on drugs will tell you that the rate of drug use between whites and blacks is virtually the same, but the arrest and conviction rate of blacks is many times that of whites.",
        "So, if there was anything lacking in the equal justice system that would not be true.",
        "There are what - black people are one-eighth of the nation's population, but we are 45 of its prisons.",
        "And we are in outsize proportion of the people in death row around the country, and Latinos are about the same proportion of the American population as black people, and they are over represented in the nation's prison systems too."

        "Big news, internationally even.",
        "So some business analysts says that the merged airline would be bigger, but not necessarily more efficient.",
        "How do you think this is going to play for Atlantans who were employed by Delta, people who were seeking employment as well as on the larger stage of business?",
        "Well, if you look at Atlanta, you know, I think about other industrialized cities and towns, and Atlanta is definitely is an aviation town.",
        "Delta is a big employer here.",
        "Delta, and the airport, the airport is either at some point the busiest airport in the world or the biggest airport in the world.",
        "We are building a billion dollar new terminal.",
        "So the airport in aviation history is really big in Atlanta.",
        "I think this moved to a merge Delta with Northwest and keeping the hub here in Atlanta, keeping the headquarters in Atlanta is going to be huge for the city.",
        "It just makes a stronger globally, makes a stronger economically.",
        "I think that, you know as, as you know there are a lot of things going on with gas prices and fuel prices and things of that nature, but I think that is going to be a huge plus for not only for Atlanta, but also for the aviation industry for the airline industry.",
        "And I think that hopefully, you know I think all of the Delta officials and city officials and politicians have sworn this is going to be positive.",
        "There are going to be jobs created.",
        "I would like to think that this going to happen, and Atlanta will continue to boom with this.",
        "Chandra, we've been talking to people throughout the week about how they feel about Atlanta, and people here are very proud.",
        "They have a few graves like the traffic.",
        "Do you think that building, you know expanding the airport is going to cause yet another bit of congestion or do the benefits out way that?",
        "Well, I think as Ernie pointed out that the airport has been a huge asset, and there are a lot of cities in this region that had the potential traffic.",
        "Do you think that building, expanding the airport is going to cost yet another bit of congestion or do the benefits outweigh that?",
        "Oh, I think, as Ernie pointed out, that the airport has been a huge asset, and there are a lot of cities in this region that had the potential, and the airport is what really sets Atlanta apart.",
        "And of course, bring in the Olympics.",
        "It is really a plus because of the fact that you can get anywhere all over the world definitely has an impact on the city.",
        "And I think that the biggest challenge with this merger is going to be, how do they meld these two companies together?",
        "And I think that the biggest thing that all of us care about is, how does it impact the prices?",
        "Will I have to pay more for my flight?",
        "And also, will the services be decreased?",
        "And if there is a lack of competition, would we kind of be forced to pay those higher prices?",
        "Bruce, what do you think about that?",
        "How are the passengers going to fair?",
        "Because I have to say that I am flying out tomorrow, and every single seat is filled.",
        "Gone are those days before 9/11 when you could get a whole row to yourself."
