        "Just to send a message: This is not going to be the same.",
        "We're doing something that serves multiple communities.",
        "The second thing I did is just get out and walk around, met with faculty, got into the community, attended every event, had more nights filled than I could ever recall.",
        "The third I did was create a kind of organization chart and got the people together that could make the place change.",
        "So I'm a strong believer in responsibility and authority, and we sent that message right away, and it worked.",
        "Your problem was growth, and growth may not be as easy as people think, but one of the benefits is you get to say yes a lot.",
        "Yeah, we made the decision that we were going to get bigger and better at the same time.",
        "Now, people told us that was impossible, that if we got bigger, the quality of our students would go down, and exactly the opposite happened.",
        "Now, we had to tell our story, and we told our story every possible way, in every possible hour of the day, week, month, whatever it meant to us.",
        "So we went out and we wanted to get big, we wanted to get better, and we wanted to serve the community.",
        "But equally, we wanted to take advantage of the community.",
        "In my inaugural talk, I said we had to take advantage of this community.",
        "We'll get to that in just a minute, but telling your story, does that reveal hours of strategic planning and mission statements?",
        "We have a little bit of that, but I think the strength of George Mason University is we have a plan, we have a vision, but we have a propensity to act, to make decisions, to make things happen."
