        "So it takes a kind of individual.",
        "Most universities couldn't tolerate it.",
        "As one of my friends said to me early on, he said there are very few universities you could tolerate, and he looked at me and he said, there are very few universities that could tolerate you.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "That's an interesting way to look at it.",
        "One of the opportunities that presented itself was you were in an area in Northern Virginia that was undergoing rapid growth.",
        "And a lot of new businesses, a lot of new technology was starting up in the corridor between Washington, D.C.",
        "and the airport out at Dulles.",

        "And was there also, as you looked at the competition in the Northern Virginia area - you've got the University of Virginia, of course - that's some ways away, but if you're looking in the Northern Virginia area, you've got prestigious institutions like Georgetown and George Washington.",
        "You've got the American University.",
        "Was there a niche there that George Mason was able to fill?",
        "I think in most of the cases, the niche was really more culture-oriented.",

        "When we would hire people from some of those institutions that you mentioned, they got frustrated where they were before, and they wanted to make things happen.",
        "So the niche was technology, to a great degree, but beyond that it was really more of an attitude.",

        "Initially, it was June who, June what, and not understanding the value of celebrating this, you know, commemoration of this - how slavery started and ended in America.",
        "But what we've been able to do is by looking at this difficult history, like the Nat Turner insurrection and Fort Monroe as the Ellis Island of the 19th century, we've been able to help people understand the roots of issues like racism and oppression in terms of what the roots of those things are and how they impact who we are today.",
        "And that's been a hard sell, but we need to be able to get into schools and communities with this work because the people that we use to tell these stories, this history, are local people, people who are chronically unemployed, young people, seniors, people who are able to talk about this history in ways that help people understand how, how do we get beyond the anger and the hate and the frustrations based in the past and deal with solving problems of today.",
        "And that's been a hard sell.",
        "As simple as it is and as simple as I think it should be for people to understand, it's a really difficult sell.",
        "President Merten, you were...",
        "Well, I think one of the keys that we found early on, and I think the caller touches on, you have to do something every day with respect to transformation.",

        "Every day is an opportunity for you to bring people along.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "But it's just - it's hard work, and people who constrain themselves, they're not going to make - you have to have high goals, high vision of what you want to do.",
        "What we want to do now is to make films about this history, and Hampton Roads is a large military area.",
        "We have (unintelligible), which has been downsized as a military installation, but it's a perfect movie studio in terms of what they have to offer in terms of equipment and so forth.",
        "And we have all of this history that's been untapped, untouched and literally, as we celebrate the 150th of the end of the Civil War, this is the prime opportunity to do this work."

        "Well, I think first and foremost I tried to help our organization understand that the path that we had been on before, while it serves some purposes in terms of providing good health care, it didn't serve the purpose of creating an organization with long-term financial viability.",
        "So one of the first things that we did in our organization is we sat down with all the leaders, and I was more transparent with them than I think some of my predecessors had been around how big, deep and wide our problems were.",
        "And I simply said to them: Look, the CEO doesn't have all the answers.",

        "Well, we did.",
        "We did have to say no a lot, and the no was not because it wasn't a good idea.",
        "The no was because we simply hadn't honored our obligation to our community, to sort of organize ourselves in a fiscally viable way.",
        "And so what I said to a lot of our organization, a lot of our physicians and our managers and staff, was that we could say yes a lot more if we got a handle on how do we change things.",
        "How do we stop doing a lot of things that we've been doing that didn't have the kind of economic value that we needed to have for the future?"
