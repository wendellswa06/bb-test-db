        "But the question is how we were going to make it a better university.",
        "And we didn't have the crisis.",
        "So it's important to be able to transform an institution even when you don't have a crisis.",
        "And I think sometimes that's even harder.",
        "Rahm Emanuel will be remembered for many things, as White House chief of staff, but I think probably most famously for the phrase never let a good crisis go to waste.",

        "We're talking about remarkable transformations, organizations re-imagined and reinvented, from schools to hospitals to manufacturers.",
        "Our guests helped lead changes at two very different institutions, Alan Merten, president of George Mason University and widely recognized for transforming the campus from a commuter school into a respected national university; and Wright Lassiter, CEO of the Alameda County Medical Center in Oakland, California, profiled in this April's Fast Company magazine as an example of a leader who turned his institution around.",
        "If you've worked in an organization that transformed itself or tried to, we want to hear from you.",
        "What worked?",
        "What didn't?",
        "800-989-8255.",

        "And you can also join the conversation on our website.",
        "That's at npr.org.",
        "Click on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "And I wonder, between the two of you, Alan Merten at a university and Wright Lassiter at a hospital, you both had people who worked there and probably had worked there a long time who pretty much assumed they knew everything and all the answers.",
        "Well, one thing that I think Wright have in common is individuals, in his case maybe the medical staff and in my case professors who really care about the institution, but in many cases they care about the institution as long as it doesn't change.",
        "Change is something they want someone else to undergo.",
        "I think you've got to bring them along.",
        "You bring most of them along, but I'm sure as Wright found out, there's some who don't come along.",
        "They don't want to change, and you're stuck with the fact that some are going to be with you, and some aren't."

        "I would agree with that, Neal.",
        "You know, I think that we did have some of those on-the-bus, off-the-bus kind of conversations with some of our leaders early on, in sort of saying to them that this is a collective effort, it's not an effort of a small group of leaders.",
        "It's not just an effort of a new board of trustees.",
        "It takes a collective effort to change some of the things we had to change.",
        "And I think, Wright Lassiter, you must have faced some similar kinds of problems.",
        "Let's talk with Tim, Tim with us from Wilmington, North Carolina.",
        "But clearly, you know, you have a bell curve of those individuals who early adopt to changes and those who are sort of laggards and sort of wait for objective evidence that change is going to be forced upon them if they don't willingly go along.",
        "So I would agree with Alan's perspective on that.",
        "We've also - I think in all these cases, it's important to have a board that's supportive of what you're trying to do as a chief executive officer.",
        "In our case, the board is appointed by the governor.",
        "But for majority of early years, my presidency at George Mason, Ed Meese, former attorney general, was the chairman of the board.",
        "And his support was invaluable.",
        "The other thing I'd just throw on the table that I learned that shocked me is how important facilities are.",
        "You know, you look at the intellectual property, you look at the capital of any institutions, and you think, well facilities are also part of it.",
        "I learned early on that you - there are certain things you can't do, no matter what kind of vision you have, unless you have good facilities.",
        "And you've got to get on with that right away.",
        "You can't wait until some other point in time.",
        "Well, you know, I would just add, certainly governance is a key success factor.",
        "I would agree with Alan that a lot of our success has been significantly predicated on having a very strong board of trustees that provide governance for our organization."

        "Yes, the first thing I did, I took over a - running a 150-year-old daily newspaper that was on the verge of collapse.",
        "And as I suspected, after my first initial discussions with all the employees and people in town and so forth was that there was a lack of trust between the ownership and the employees.",
        "And I set about gaining that trust, and I think that was critical in having everyone follow the plan I then put into place.",
        "And I assure the - all the employees and colleagues that, should they could along, would have to work hard, but we would all share in the success as we went along.",
        "And we turned it around in the matter of 18 months, and they are still thriving today, in spite of all that's going on in the daily newspaper world.",
        "Were you an outsider, BJ?",
        "Yes, I had come from another newspaper group and came into this privately held operation.",
        "And I was, oh, younger than many of the employees.",
        "But that didn't bother me.",
        "I simply laid out the guidelines and the goals after talking to everybody, and that was a key.",
        "I sat down and talked to people.",
        "I found out what they did, even if I knew very well what they did.",
        "I heard their side of it, and I then I said: Okay, let's develop goals together.",

        "I do want to just highlight a point that BJ made around trust, and you cannot underestimate the importance of building trust with leaders and their organization and the community, particularly when you're coming in from the outside.",
        "That was very, very important for me and our organization, and a lot of that trust is built around transparency.",

        "But the hiring of me as a change agent did not match underlying sentimentality of the NGO.",

        "The culture trumped the necessary change, and the NGO faces some serious realignment in the 21st century.",

        "I think the point that your emailer referenced is one that both Alan and I have talked about, and that is alignment between the executive of an organization and its governing board.",
        "And for me, we certainly experienced some challenges early on around governance and sort of direction we were heading.",
        "But I've had, since my tenure here, six years now, three extremely effective board chairs, and those individuals assisted me greatly as a partner with ensuring that the board ultimately bought in to the direction we were heading and then gave the CEO, appropriately so, the latitude to implement the change that we all agreed on.",
