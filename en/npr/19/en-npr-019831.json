        "And I think that a very important aspect of changed management is having a visionary who can look to the future and see down the road, a year or two, a change in the culture that then can lead to a change in the direction the organization is going, such as they're having to do now with gender identity, the DOD very smartly got ahead of the process and is meeting it under their terms, not under terms dictated to - by others or the situation or the politics.",

        "Robert, though, as we now get ready to do away with \"\"don't ask, don't tell,\"\" do you think they're going to be able to handle that cultural shift in the same manner?",
        "Well, I think that it'll be a much easier transition, because if the military is already rolling out the change process well in advance of any rapid shifts in doctrine, and the other issue, it's much like the difference in race back in the mid-'50s or late '40s for Korean War.",

        "But I - looking back at it, when people tell you you're going to fail, you have to probe and say, well, why?",
        "And the answer is, in many cases, they don't understand your style, let alone your vision.",
        "You know, I would just add to that that, you know, early on in my tenure, there were a couple of individuals that I listened to fairly regularly who were naysayers.",
        "And I found that the comments that they made to me oftentimes were helpful in sort of balancing, you know, your exuberance around early wins or around early spread, and it didn't - I didn't use their comments as a deterrent, necessarily, but it always sort of gave me a sense for: So what are the people who are less likely to adopt to the folks who are more entrenched, or who aren't really willing to change?",
