        "Tell us about your car work.",
        "Well, we've been designing and building hybrid and electric vehicles for the past 10 years.",
        "I started it as an after-school program just to try to get more interest around math and science as a math and science teacher.",
        "And it's evolved to a point where we're in a position to compete with some of the best companies in the world, designing this hundred-mile-per-gallon vehicle.",
        "And you are able to compete with them?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The technology is off the shelf.",
        "I mean, one of the fascinating things about the automotive X PRIZE is that before it was announced there were many, many startup companies that began to produce these types of vehicles.",
        "And in my opinion, the country has reached the tipping point.",
        "you know, this technology is available.",
        "If the Inner City High School can do it, that says something.",
        "Tell us about that Inner City High School car.",
        "What can it do?",
        "How does it work?",
        "Sure.",
        "So the first car that we develop got 180 miles per gallon equivalent.",
        "It was a Saturn, and we won a national competition beating out top universities.",
        "That was back in 2002.",
        "That was - that kind of put this on the map.",
        "And then we developed a super fast hybrid vehicle that gets over 60 miles to the gallon.",
        "So, imagine a Porsche or a Ferrari, the car is very attractive.",
        "And we did to kind of break the stereotypes or one that a hybrid car can look like and behave like, and that's been on the Discovery channel and in the national news.",
        "And that kind of built our confidence and along the way we built the knowledge of how to create an affordable, safe vehicle that can get over a hundred miles per gallon.",
        "So we're what we're doing specifically is, we're building a parallel plug-in hybrid on a Ford Focus chassis.",
        "And we use the Ford Focus, it's a light-weight vehicle, it meets safety standards and it's very cost-effective.",
        "What are the parts that make it work so well?",
        "Sure.",
        "We're using as our dynamics an electric drive system.",
        "It's a very robust, very well-tested electric drive system.",
        "We're using lithium iron phosphate batteries.",
        "We have a battery pack that weighs 200 pounds and will take the car on electric power about 60 miles on electric only.",
        "So, if you're using it just for daily commuting, the gas engine will never kick on.",
        "And then we're using a small two-cylinder diesel engine, and we've got a pretty clever configuration where it can act as a generator or drive the vehicle.",
        "So it can recharge the batteries if you're driving on a long trip, and the battery's packaged to a low level at this point.",
        "Or if you need extra power you getting on an on-ramp and, you know, you want to be pushed back in the seat it will kick on as well.",
        "So you're doing this with all off-the-shelf parts?",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "Yeah."

        "That's one of the most attractive cars out there.",
        "And we did on a shoestring budget out of West Philadelphia.",
        "You know, the technology has been here and I think, you know, just take my word for it, if you look at the companies, the legitimate companies, that are entering vehicles in automotive X PRIZE, these guys are going to build these vehicles if there's an X PRIZE or if Detroit goes under or if it doesn't go under.",
        "It's just the time is here, the technology is available.",
        "There's no reason that we can't have this.",
        "Why aren't you getting the money we're giving to the car companies then?",
        "You know, that's - ask President Obama.",
        "We were on another show a couple of weeks ago on NPR, and a caller called in and said, you know, the exact same thing.",
        "What would you guys do if they gave you a million dollars or a few of these other top companies in the X PRIZE?",
        "And, you know, this vehicle that we're building will achieve over a hundred miles per gallon.",
        "And it's going to be priced so an average school teacher can afford it, unlike a lot of these concept cars.",
        "So it's built on a conventional car chassis.",
        "Yes.",
        "So, it's already passed the safety standards.",
        "Yeah.",

        "But one of the interesting things about the lithium iron phosphate technology is that you can charge it very rapidly up to 80-percent capacity, and so some of the competitors and the X PRIZE will be doing that.",
        "But, you know, this is a big - this is a huge step forward in terms of battery technology.",
        "The lithium batteries that we're use on our cell phones and laptops are not as stable as this newer technology and we've tested out - it's actually well-tested by lots of folks and - so that's one of the exciting innovations in the last year or so.",

        "And so this is not just an uber-engineering or an academic exercise.",
        "And that's a big change for this particular competition.",
        "The competitions we were in the past, the cool sports car that I've describing that we built, it would cost over a hundred thousand dollars to make.",
        "The car we built back in 2002, they got over 180 miles a gallon, not too many people would've really wanted to drive around in that on a daily commute.",
        "But the crux of the X PRIZE is that - is to design a vehicle that people want and can afford.",
        "And so to that end, we need a business and Drexel University has partnered with us, the MBA School.",
        "We had a few major points and then they develop a business plan around it.",
        "And you said this is a car even school teachers could afford."
