        "We have not.",
        "This competition is designed to mirror, sort of, and OEM design competition.",
        "So to that end, the first - the entire first year, this competition is modeling and simulation, so we do everything on the computer and with our virtual - in our lab before we, you know, actually put it on the vehicle.",
        "So you're taking more of a conventional route that Detroit might take.",
        "No.",
        "All the service will be done for you.",
        "So you know, you'd wake in the morning, your car would be clean.",
        "Be exciting, right?",
        "On concept.",
        "Right, exactly and that's - and the reason for that is we can't afford on and buy all these different components that we have available to try all the different ones.",
        "So this gives us the ability to, you know, to test it all before we actually go and buy all the parts for the car.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Do you really think it should take three or four years for car companies to wait until 2011 to come out with a higher efficiency automobile?",
        "Well, it's really hard to say.",
        "We have some luxuries here with our teams that we don't have to design the entire vehicle from the ground up.",
        "We don't have to worry about edesigning of the safety systems.",
        "Those things are already integrated in the car.",
        "So we really - our design competition is a three-year competition.",
        "But for our end, it's mostly just redesigning the power strength of the vehicle.",
        "So are you working with General Motors on this at all?",
        "Ah, yes.",
        "GM and Department of Energy are the two headline sponsors."

        "I think that this vehicle - and I can go and tell you that our architecture is - was called an extended range electric vehicle, which is very similar to the Chevy Volt, and we're really excited about it because I think this is the architecture that can really at least be a stepping stone and can provide probably the biggest short-term, you know, impact towards improving our national dependence on oil.",
        "And how soon do you think you'll have your car ready?",
        "Our vehicle will be - we'll get it this upcoming summer and we have one year to do the implementation of our power train, and we have some internal design objectives.",
        "We'd like to get it done sooner than that so we can do a little bit of testing and refinement.",

        "As soon as possible.",

        "We tell them, you can build a car.",

        "The last time we spoke was the middle of the summer of 2007.",
        "And we had just picked India as our initial target launch location and a little bit like the last speaker on the program, we're pretty excite to get building things.",
        "And so we just got back from Torino in Italy with our first vehicle prototype.",
        "It's a six-passenger series hybrid.",
        "So we have an electric motor, we have similarly an onboard generator APU, and we're in Italy for about three months with about 40 students.",
        "So internationally, we have about 20 teams all working on this vehicle, and we had about two representatives from each of these groups.",
        "We're super lucky.",
        "We worked with some design firms in Torino, a company called Wandra(ph) that does testing.",
        "So after you have one, you figure out how to make 40 and do crash tests, and also a groups called FS that makes super shiny, sleek first prototypes.",
        "So that's pretty excellent.",
        "So do you have something ready for mass assembly?",
        "(Laughing) So the first prototype we were working on was primarily there to do testing of the chassis of the power train, and also of our international consortium and see what happens, you know, if you have 200 people and they're all distributed and you brought them together for the first time to see how all the pieces are fitting.",
        "The goal by the end of the next summer is to have something that is designed and built as if we had just pulled it off an assembly line.",
        "But obviously, without...",
        "Yeah.",
        "The billions and billions of dollars that you actually having to go ahead and build that assembly line.",
        "And how many miles per gallon will this one get?",
        "The goal is to hit 200 miles per gallon, but we also think that while miles per gallon is an interesting and useful indicator of how efficient a vehicle platform is, we're also very, very interested in the overall life-cycle cost of the car.",
        "So if you imagined a mountain of all the stuff.."
