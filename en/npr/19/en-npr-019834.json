        "Yeah.",
        "That is sort of dislodged or disrupted when you're making the body or the chassis or the fuel, we're interested in seeing that mountain size decreased by 95 percent from that first mining when you're digging out the iron ore to the point where the vehicle is recycled.",
        "And so that miles per gallon number is just a little piece of the overall goal and objective of our project.",
        "All right.",
        "Stay with us.",

        "We're talking this hour about greener cars.",
        "My guest is Anna Jaffe.",
        "She's one of the co-founders of the Vehicle Design Summit based in MIT.",
        "Anna, are there any hints you can give Detroit?",
        "(Laughing) Well, you know, I think there's sort of a near-term and long-term planning and, well, one of the things we found working on this project is that the vehicle is obviously really, really, really important.",
        "But also how the vehicle is used, how it service is perhaps even more important.",
        "I think Oakridge projected that the average person spends, you know, $7.5 thousand a year on their average car.",
        "And that's a huge, huge, huge amount of money.",
        "And so one of the areas we've been - we've split our work sort of evenly between both the vehicle platform and also new business models.",
        "So if I were to sit down with GM or Ford or Chrysler, I don't think I'd be giving them a technology lecture.",
        "I think they have fairly extraordinary knowledge and capacity when it comes to that.",
        "But thinking really differently about how they sell cars, how they maybe lease elements in the vehicles and how maybe they become not necessarily car sharing companies, but certainly, service providers of mobility as opposed to just platform sellers.",
        "What do you mean by that last comment?",
        "So we - if you think about how a vehicle is used, you know, one challenge for Detroit is as they spend money to make vehicles more and more efficient, they don't necessarily gain from that financially.",
        "It might be good for the world, which you know, you certainly would hope that something was of value to them.",
        "But if a vehicle were to save $2,000 or $3,000 or $4,000 in a year because it gets 200 miles per gallon, it would be great if GM or Ford were to get, you know, maybe a thousand dollars of that savings, which would help them then to invest in ever better platforms.",
        "One way to do this is to - there's a company in Boston called Zipcar, for example, that has a car share service, and in our context in India, the group who are most likely to buy vehicles like ours are usually employed fairly centrally in industrial zones.",
        "And so one model we've been looking at is having major industries buy large fleets.",
        "In this case, they could provide buy them directly from OEM, and couple, then, that OEM with an energy provider.",
        "So you wouldn't be - have to worry about owning the car any more?",
        "I was surprised.",
        "I thought Marco Rubio would still be in the race.",
        "But as a Ted Cruz supporter, I am very happy.",
        "And I actually still think that Cruz is going to be our GOP nominee.",
        "Neatly arranged right on the dash board, waiting for you.",
        "You'd get to work.",
        "You could go to work with your colleagues.",
        "You know, you probably get paid to do that and you know, your car would never be out of fuel.",
        "If you're - while you're in your work, the vehicle will be serviced for you.",
        "Maybe a secondary driver would use and you get a little bit of money back.",
        "The OEM would get a little bit of money back for whatever work that car did during the day and ideally, everyone ends up happy."

        "And then, Neal, it's very important to start now making the investments in our country and in our people to create the good jobs of the future, because obviously, for anybody, whether it's Beth's husband, whether it's other listeners, none of these problems can be solved unless they can find, and keep, a good job that provides a good standard of living.",

        "And I think that's a representation of why he has crossover appeal because if Republicans are telling him he's not conservative enough for them, then that opens the door to all these independents and Democrats who feel isolated by the over-conservativism (ph) coming from the right always.",
