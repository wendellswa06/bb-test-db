        "What do you like about his policy positions because he hasn't been so detailed on a lot of policy?",
        "OK, well, from the social issues perspective, he's the only Republican that says that he supports funding Planned Parenthood and sees a benefit that it has for women's issues.",
        "That doesn't necessarily mean that he supports abortion, but he doesn't believe that, you know, what his ideology is needs to be the ideology for everyone.",
        "I think if you look at guns, for example, he's a big proponent of the Second Amendment.",
        "I'm a big proponent of the Second Amendment, but he's from New York City.",
        "And the culture in New York City is such that maybe guns are not as needed in this environment as opposed to someone living in rural Vermont.",
        "So I see opportunity for him to bring compromise on these issues that most Republicans that are really conservative don't want to budge on.",
        "What about issues like immigration?",
        "I think that to get to a middle ground that's workable in a partisan and divided Congress, you need to have both proposals.",
        "So if you propose something like let's deport all illegal immigrants, it leaves room for people to be OK, with, OK, let's build a wall; let's allow people to register, and if they're not criminals, they can stay and never become citizens.",
        "A workable middle ground can start there.",
        "So you think this is just a negotiating tactic?",
        "Absolutely, and he talks about this in \"\"The Art Of The Deal,\"\" that it's a negotiating tactic for two reasons.",
        "One, it allows him to get to a workable middle, but two, it gets media attention and it uses the media for his benefit.",
        "And I think the numbers came out where he's gotten 2 billion dollars' worth of free coverage from the media.",
        "And it's been a hugely successful method.",
        "Margaret.",
        "Our last two Republican candidates, McCain and Romney, were middle-ground candidates, and they both lost.",
        "It's time to go with a true conservative.",
        "All right, I want to bring in Margaret.",
        "What do you think about that?",
        "Well, these letters are just tragic, and they remind us that the route to a stronger economy runs straight through taking control of our energy future.",
        "Senator McCain has proposed a Project Lexington, a declaration of independence from the tyranny of Middle Eastern states that control too much of the world's oil.",
        "It begins with sensible relief in the short run, taxes that are lower on gasoline that can help families and truckers, relief from tariffs that stop cheaper alternatives to gasoline coming into the country, greater domestic production of both oil and natural gas, which heats our homes and are not as internationally available as oil might be."

        "I mean, what you're saying, Will, while I appreciate, you know, is this argument out there in the conservative atmosphere - oh, you must - the reason Mitt Romney and the reason John McCain didn't win is because they weren't conservative enough.",
        "So this time, we're going to pick the guy who is absolutely the most conservative, and then we're going to win.",
        "But you know what, guys?",
        "This is larger than ideology.",
        "This is about demographics.",
        "And the problem with Mitt Romney and the problem with John McCain and the problem that Donald Trump will have is that none of them can get enough white male voters to the polls to make up for the fact that we are not getting enough Hispanic voters and enough women voters and enough African-American voters.",
        "And we need to be thinking, as young Republicans, about the future of the Republican Party and how we are going to broaden it and sustain it so that there is a coalition that can win not this year, not next year, but into the 21st century.",
        "And I know that was the tagline for Marco Rubio's campaign, and he wasn't able to actuate it.",
        "But we do really need to think about that and think about how to do it.",
        "Well, that's the bottom line, right?",
        "Like, there's all this talk about potentially a contested convention.",
        "And Mitt Romney has just come out and said that he's going to caucus for Ted Cruz.",
        "But it wasn't really an endorsement.",
        "It was, I'm going to do this just to deny Donald Trump the delegates that he needs to win outright.",

        "I mean, people go for Donald Trump because they know that he's not part of this system that's bought and paid for that isn't representing the people.",

        "Your vote didn't matter.",
        "Our choice is what really matters; we know best.",
        "I agree with Donald Trump.",
        "I'm not saying there's going to be riots, but there will be a march on Cleveland with a bunch of people who no longer believe that this country is a democratic republic.",
        "Chelsi, if Donald Trump is the nominee, would you vote for him?",
