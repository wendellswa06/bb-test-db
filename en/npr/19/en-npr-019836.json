        "I'm just wondering what that plan would be.",
        "What don't we start with Douglas Holtz-Eakin?",
        "Well, the senator proposed a - what he called a home plan, the opportunity for mortgage exchange which allows those individuals who were in their home - you know, they weren't speculators.",
        "They were trying to raise their family there.",
        "They had the financial ability to live in a home, but they're in the wrong mortgage.",
        "And he proposed that those individuals could apply, and make it as simple as possible, go down to the post office, get an application form, get an exchange for the mortgage that's underwater, or unable to be serviced on, a 30-year fixed rate mortgage with an FHA guarantee on terms that would allow the person to stay in that home.",
        "The most important thing is to keep Americans in the home.",
        "As the clip indicated, he's not interested in taking money out of Main Streets' pockets or reward people who did not do due diligence, either banks or other financial entities or people who borrowed just for investment purposes.",
        "He wants to take care of American homeowners.",
        "Now, the reality is that his plan is not going to become law.",
        "There is a plan coming through Congress, and the senator believes getting something done quickly is more important than anything else, and he would urge the Congress to pass that.",

        "As you indicated, Neal, although we don't know exactly how many people will be helped by this legislation, no one believes it's going to solve all the problems of the pressure in the housing market.",
        "Senator Obama, again, since last fall, has proposed a 10-billio-dollar mortgage-foreclosure-prevention fund to supplement the FHA bill, which is moving through the Congress right now, that would help communities, for example, to purchase foreclosed properties so that the entire neighborhood doesn't end up in a downward price spiral.",
        "And I think most importantly, at the present time, we need to think about the relationship between the economy and housing prices.",
