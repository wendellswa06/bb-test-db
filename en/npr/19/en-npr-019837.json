        "Yes.",
        "As a life-time conservative, I guess I see the trend in government, especially with Republicans, instead of perhaps from an economic perspective, instead of wanting to come out and solve problems, I guess my take would be, I would love to hear the McCain side have the courage to step up and say, you know, it's not necessarily out job to solve the economic problems in this country, but to create the environment for which the American people and the small businessmen and corporations can flourish.",
        "What in particular would the McCain side say that they could do, or will not do, that will allow the small-business owners and corporations to solve our ills, instead of constantly looking towards the national government to solve a problem?",
        "And I'll take my comments offline.",
        "Thank you.",
        "All right, Chris, thanks very much.",
        "So, Doug Holtz-Eakin, does Senator McCain agree with Ronald Reagan, that government's not part of the solution, government's the problem?",
        "Senator McCain believes that there's a role for government, that that role is contained and that ought to be done effectively.",
        "I mean, the real indictment of government at the moment is the fact that American taxpayers lost complete trust that their dollars are being used at the national interest, and he's proposed reforms to the earmarking process, which makes sure special interests get taken care of before the national interest.",
        "But you know, the caller's question is, you know, what can we do for the small businesses that are the life blood of this economy?",
        "Well, we don't want to raise their tax rates as, quite frankly, Senator Obama will.",
        "You don't want to restrict their access to capital, through dividends, capital-gains tax rates or owners regulation.",
        "You really want to make sure that they have the access to world markets.",
        "Senator McCain is committed to enhancing our ability to sell our products around the globe.",
        "Ninety-five percent of the world's customers are outside these borders.",
        "We want every American worker to be able to go to a firm that can sell goods even to Colombia, for example.",
        "At this moment, Senator Obama is stopping the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.",
        "A couple of years ago, Senator Obama voted for the Andean Trade Preferences Agreement that let any goods come in to the U.S.",
        "from Colombia duty free, so our market's open, but we're not going to be able to sell in Colombia.",
        "The senator doesn't believe that's right.",
        "We're going to go, be able to sell everywhere.",
        "Let's create the environment where the workers are educated, the healthcare costs aren't too high, the energy's not too expensive, you can sell anywhere, and let small businesses take care of this problem.",
        "OK, and let's turn to you, Doug Tarullo.",
        "Well, you know, the - I think...",
        "Dan Tarullo, excuse me.",
        "A principle position of economic conservatives over the years has been one of fiscal responsibility.",
        "And I think, again, what you hear from Senator McCain is a hope for fiscal responsibility but no details of how he would get there, a 150-billion dollar cut in discretionary spending.",
        "I mean, that's more than one out of every four non-military discretionary-spending dollars.",
        "Where is this going to come from?",
        "Is it even realistic to think about that?",
        "As opposed to Senator Obama's approach, which is to say, here is what I know we're going to confront.",
        "We need to be investing more in education to give our people the opportunities that they want, but it's only fiscally responsible if we identify the sources of revenue and then let the economy grow.",
        "With respect to small businesses, Senator Obama has proposed that there be no capital gains for startup businesses, the businesses that are creating the new jobs of the future.",
        "The idea that the way to create economic growth is to squeeze the middle class more is just a wrongheaded approach."

        "And finally let me say on trade, and specifically on Colombia, Senator Obama believes very much that there should be a trading system in which the middle class is growing, not just in the United States, but also growing abroad, because the middle class abroad can be a market for our goods.",
        "But it doesn't make any sense to pass a trade agreement which is supposed to include basic protections for workers in an environment in which workers are, or labor union organizers are, being killed because they are engaged in that kind of activity.",
        "That's not the kind of trade agreement he wants to support.",
        "Let's get another caller in, Doug on the Democratic line from Chicago.",
        "The U.S.",
        "spends more on the military than the rest of the world combined, and we have no threatening neighbors.",
        "A dollar spent on education is better than bombs.",
        "Will you cut military spending?",
        "And I ask you both to begin yes or no, and then expand that way, and why don't we turn first to you, Daniel Tarullo?",
        "Senator McCain will leave Iraq on the right terms, with peace, and he will use the opportunity of the presidency to take on the remainder of the Pentagon budget, which is characterized by a procurement system where we buy things we really do not need, they're not in our strategic interests, where we buy them in a way that we spend too much money on them, and he will take on that kind of a spending problem that has been in Washington for a long, long time.",
        "And let me ask you both, there have been proposals to expand the armed forces by two divisions, in the Army and more for the Marine Corps, as well.",
        "Again, would Senator McCain support that?",
        "It's an expensive proposition.",
        "Senator McCain would, in fact, expand the Army and the Marines, those troops that have been on the ground.",
        "We've seen the duress that these troops have been under.",
        "There are too few.",
        "They've had to go back to Iraq, Afghanistan, too many times.",
        "We do need a larger force on the ground.",
        "But the ratio of, essentially, backup-to-footprint-on-the-ground is much too large in the Defense Department.",
        "There are places where the senator believes we can aggressively look at that overall budget and expand the boots on the ground in a fiscally sensible way.",
        "Dan Tarullo?",
        "Neal, it is important, notwithstanding what I said earlier, which is absolutely Senator Obama's position, that he will draw down the troops in Iraq.",
        "It is very important that we not lose sight of his overall position, which is the United States does face real threats, and we do need a strong military, and we need a strong military that is going to be deployed against those threats, and against those threats effectively.",
        "So, whether it is in terms of readjusting the special forces or the kinds of activities that will be effective in dealing with terrorism or some other approach, even though military spending will be reduced, it is not a question of simply pulling back behind our borders.",
        "He doesn't think at all that's what we should be doing."

        "Well, that is going to depend, Neal, obviously, on the state of the economy.",
        "If, as many economists fear, we're going to continue to be in a downward slide or a very bad performance in the housing market and employment market and elsewhere, we obviously would need to think about the stimulus package which Senator Obama has put forth.",
        "So, that would have to be - you have to respond to the circumstances you face.",
        "I think in terms of going forward, some of the big, important, transforming proposals that he's put forth, such as his healthcare plan, would be very high on his agenda.",
        "And let's turn to you, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the first thing a President McCain would act on regarding the economy.",
        "Senator McCain believes we have to reverse, you know, three decades of bipartisan failure on our energy policies.",
        "In the '70s, we had 30 percent of our oil imported.",
        "Now it's 60 percent.",
        "Our national security is at stake because we're financing people like Hugo Chavez and Vladimir Putin, who do not share our values, and in some cases, the monies go directly to terrorists who are trying to harm us.",
        "It threatens our economy and it threatens our environment.",
        "So, he will institute the steps to free us of our strategic dependence on oil.",
        "The project, Lexington Freedom (ph), is a route to economic success, it's a route to national-security success, and it's a route to a cleaner environment.",
        "It's something that America needs.",
        "It's long overdue.",
        "It will require leadership.",
        "It will require working across party lines, and the senator believes it is something that it's imperative to get moving on right away.",
        "And one final question, we just have a couple of minutes left, so keep it brief, if you would, and that is, we're about to hear about the plight of the city of New Orleans three years after Hurricane Katrina.",
        "Well, I believe Senator McCain made a big speech down in New Orleans, right outside of New Orleans, sort of re-launching his campaign.",
        "So, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, what would a President McCain do for the city of New Orleans?",
        "President McCain would, first and foremost, meet the commitments that we've made to the city of New Orleans, the state of Louisiana.",
        "He would also fundamentally make a commitment to having jobs in America, and a package of proposals that will produce growth.",
        "There is no substitute for a job.",
        "That's true in New Orleans.",
        "It's true in Louisiana.",
        "It's true around this country.",
        "And he will never let the disgrace that was the post-Katrina recovery ever happen again.",
        "That is a failure of government.",
        "It is the reason why Americans have lost trust in the use of their dollars.",
        "He will have an overhaul of FEMA.",

        "Are they directed towards the well-being of the vast majority of Americans, in New Orleans and elsewhere, who need jobs, need healthcare, need a sense that the government is helping provide opportunities for them?",
        "I think if you just look at the tax plans of the two candidates, you'll see one with Senator Obama, in which the benefits are weighted towards the middle class, and the other and Senator McCain, in which the benefits are weighted towards the most affluent.",
