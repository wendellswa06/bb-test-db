        "But the fact is that a server knows where I'm located.",
        "Whether that's good or bad, I guess, depends on your perspective, and whether it's used properly or abused.",

        "I think all of the major phone companies now offer a service - all the cell phone companies - where you can subscribe where your child's location will be beamed to your phone or to your computer.",
        "Again, a very good service, presumably if it's used responsibly by a family.",
        "But it brings up all sorts of implications, both in terms of privacy and safety.",
        "You certainly wouldn't want a stalker or, God forbid, a pedophile to know exactly where your child is.",
