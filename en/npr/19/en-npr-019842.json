        "Hello.",
        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "And what are your concerns about GPS?",
        "Well, we're already in a world where more and more of our activities can be viewed or tracked and more importantly can be sort of correlated and linked together.",
        "And location data is incredibly meaningful and revealing.",
        "One state supreme court, in trying to decide whether or not the police should be able to use a GPS tracking device to - without a warrant based on probable cause, ended up saying no, and they pointed out that, you know, that GPS tracking would create this detailed record of travel - to doctors' offices, banks, gambling casinos, tanning salons, places of worship, political party meetings, bars, grocery stores and so on.",
        "Just to clarify, this was somebody - a suspect they had, presumably without a warrant, but they wanted to find out where he or she was going at all times.",
        "That's right.",
        "Okay.",
        "That's right.",
        "And the state Supreme Court of Washington said, well, you need to have - the police need to have a warrant in order to do that.",
        "And the state of New York has said the same thing.",
        "They said that a person must feel secure that his or her every movement will not be tracked except upon a warrant based on probable cause.",
        "And I know there are…",
        "Technology should not abrogate our constitutional protections.",
        "I know you also have concerns about the rights of employees, some of those conditions that Larry Magid was talking about earlier."

        "Well, that's right.",
        "I mean, the law is really, really poorly developed in this area of what Larry correctly pointed out is really a question of locational privacy.",
        "And in the employment context, this is especially bad because, of course, whatever protections might exist in the law, in most cases, employers can ask their employees or would-be employees to consent to some kind of a tracking.",
        "Pam, we wish your son the best of luck.",
        "Oh, thank you.",
        "Appreciate the phone call.",
        "So whatever is in the law - unless it's specifically provided, they cannot be waived by agreement - is likely to end up being the rule for a worker.",
        "And as he pointed out, a lot of folks who were subject to this kind of surveillance have been chafing under it.",
        "But the, you know, the systems are getting much broader.",
        "I mean, for instance, it's going to affect not just people in the work context but the average citizen.",
        "For instance, they're talking in New York City, not only about the taxi cabs, but also about congestion pricing systems that would require some sort of locational tracking of basically all of the vehicles in New York City.",
        "They've already got a system like that.",
        "I don't think it's GPS, but a system of congestion pricing and tracking in London.",
        "We're going to be dealing with the way that this kind of GPS tracking is going to be embedded into the infrastructure of everyday life and deal with all of the issues of why it should be, or how we can protect privacy in doing so, because we're worried about the fact that it - this kind of locational tracking really creates a tremendous amount of power over individuals and an enormous, sort of, 24/7 picture of where you go, where you take your kids, you know, what doctors you go to, all sorts of things that a lot of people don't necessarily want anyone else to know about.",
        "And those could be commercial application obviously as well as, you know…",
        "Well, that's absolutely right, and so there's really sort of two dimensions at least to this.",
        "You know, you think about tracking and you think about someone doing it in real time, like following your dot on the Web.",
        "But at the same time, it doesn't have to be real-time tracking.",
        "If someone is storing data, such as a commercial service the same way that your ISP stores e-mail or logs of who you've talked to or where you've gone on the Web, these services can also be storing that locational data if they're doing periodic pings.",
        "And if they store that, then it becomes accessible to anyone who is at that company or someone who's - asks for it.",
        "We've had in the case of E-ZPass and FastTrack, for instance, you know, which works at the toll plazas in - on both the East Coast and in the Bay Area; lots of situations where either the police or divorce lawyers or other folks have commenced and requested or subpoenaed the records of vehicles passing through those points and being able to, therefore, establish, oh, this person was there at this time, this person was et cetera, et cetera."

        "But - and it's really revolutionized my job.",
        "But one of the things, probably one of the most dangerous things that we do, I guess, in our job is driving.",
        "And our company is placing a lot of emphasis on safety and they're focusing on reducing safety, I mean, reducing accidents, so they're going to be placing GPS tracking devices in our cars and these devices will report your speed if you exceed the speed limit, and also if you have excess acceleration.",
        "And we bristle at that idea, my colleagues and I.",
        "But I just wanted to share that example with you folks.",
        "Bristle because, well, you're being watched all the time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that's it, and it's, you know, I appreciate their dedication to safety and I believe in that as well.",
        "But it is, you know, I have mixed reviews about it because I do enjoy the technology.",
        "And I like to compare myself to the airline pilots that - from the standpoints of, you know, they're flying professionals - we're driving professionals in what we do.",
        "So airline pilots have devices that track their, you know, how smoothly they fly all the time and that's just part of their job.",
        "So as sales professionals or driving professionals, should we also just accept that as that being part of our job or is it this hint of Big Brother kind of creeping in."

        "And I wonder, Lee Tien, even when the purpose was, as our last caller suggested, safety, well, it does cause some concerns.",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "I mean, again, there is a tendency these days to sort of exploit whatever privacy invasion can be justified by a legitimate purpose such as safety or congestion or needing to pay a toll, and then you've got this extra amount of surveillance, extra information, extra amount of invasion of privacy that's sort of comes with it - it's piggy-backed on it.",
        "And then, when it's sort of packaged in a good purpose like safety, people sort of let their guard down and start to accept those kinds of incursions.",
        "And the problem is that, you know, obviously as you build these systems up and you do not design for privacy, then that amount of extra surveillance is - really leads you down to a slippery slope.",
        "Now, one of the funny or interesting things is that it is possible in many cases to design privacy-protecting technology into these systems.",
        "I just had lunch with a mathematician at Stanford yesterday, Andrew Bloomberg(ph), who was describing to me ways that you could preserve privacy in an E-ZPass or FastTrack system or in a congestion pricing system and basically get the legitimate benefits of these system without actually sacrificing anyone's individual privacy unless it was absolutely necessary…",

        "And then my follow-up question, how soon before you can get a chip into my son's set of keys, which he is always losing?",
        "Larry Magid, can you help us out there?",
        "Well, one can never guarantee against hacking.",

        "There are stronger certain procedures, perhaps, that they should put in place.",

        "Even if was subpoenaed, the data is simply not held, just like ask.com today said that they're no longer going to be retaining data.",
        "So there are ways to greatly minimize the potential of a hack abuse, but it's always a risk.",
