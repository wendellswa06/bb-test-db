        "It's - there's strategy.",
        "There's skills, and the team camaraderie.",
        "It's - there's a lot of benefit that you're kind of overlooking, not to mention in poorer areas where the football team helps kids stay in school.",
        "And you make good points, Pam, but would you be surprised if you got a call one day or you were there and saw your son carried off on a stretcher?",
