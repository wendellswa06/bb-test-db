        "Oh, definitely.",

        "Well, the Pacific, I think, must have been instructive.",

        "So I chose this route because it is - of the Atlantic, it is considered the more friendly route compared to the North Atlantic.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And I'm leaving at this time of year because it's least likely to have any storms.",
        "But with that in mind, these boats have made it through hurricanes and 50-foot waves.",
