        "The black community was almost a trillion dollar economy.",
        "If you add to that the poor white economy in the small towns and rural areas, you probably have another trillion dollar economy that's underserved.",
        "And yet businesses are growing all over the world.",
        "They're neglecting the black community, and they're neglecting the rural South.",
        "Andy, before taking the post though, you certainly knew the controversy that came with dealing with Wal-Mart on the other side of the coin, the concern...",
        "I did.",
        "I was there last year trying to bring Wal-Mart into Nigeria.",
        "They asked me if I would consider doing this and I just said, sure.",

        "I actually went to China.",
        "I went to Vietnam.",
        "I went to Indonesia, and I studied the situation for myself.",

        "And I went back six months later and checked it out to see if they had done some of the things that I suggested.",
        "But $18 out of $100 pair of shoes stayed in Asia; $25 went to Portland for the ideas, the design, the management and marketing; but the majority of the dollars in a $100 pair of shoes went to places like Shoe Town, Sports Authority and created an industry that served our communities.",
        "I think Wal-Mart is the same way.",
        "There are problems when you have anybody that employees more than a million people.",
        "But the problems in Wal-Mart are nothing compared to the problems that these people had before Wal-Mart got there.",
        "Well, Andy, let me stop you there and ask you in terms of just reconciling.",
        "Let's take Nike and Wal-Mart as a for instance.",
        "You talked about all of the monies that stay in the community through Nike, yet there were those who were concerned about the literal death of young people because of those $100 shoes, the pressure it put on poor parents to buy them.",
        "In Wal-Mart's case, it's the question of anti-labor practices, big stick mentality pushing small business out of regions that they go to.",
        "How did you resign those things and deal with this?",
        "Well, first of all, I look at them to see whether they're true or not.",

        "The small business that everybody wants to protect are the same small business that have been overcharging black people and poor people all over the country.",

        "Well, all my northern friends said those are slave wages.",
        "But in my church members, they were getting $3.00 a day for chopping cotton.",
        "So $.75 an hour was like heaven on earth.",
        "We have seen those factories move in the south, they've moved on somewhere else.",
        "But now, in the same areas, we have all kinds of small factories; all kinds of electronics; all kinds of automobile factories.",
        "And the entry level jobs are always for me the most important.",
        "And Wal-Mart provides entry level jobs where there are no jobs.",
        "So I think Wal-Mart is ultimately a wealth generator."

        "Some of the most horrific incidents in racial violence in this country that happened in the state of Mississippi happened after that game - the horrible beating that Fannie Lou Hamer suffered, the murders of the three civil rights workers, the assassination of NAACP leader in Mississippi, Medgar Evers, happened after this game, James Meredith, his march in which he was shot.",
        "So there were a number of things that happened after this particular Game of Change, which evidenced the fact that not really that much changed in the state of Mississippi.",
        "You actually went a bit farther in writing about this and talking about some deeper lessons about the role of people who are white who make sacrifices.",
        "Can you tell me what you were really digging into there?",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, we've been involved in a lot of mythmaking in sports writing, particularly when it comes to the role of sports stories in the civil rights movement and in social justice.",
        "We kind of make white figures the central figure.",
        "So Babe McCarthy, the white coach of the all-white Mississippi State team, gets talked a lot about being a conduit for making this happen."
