        "Andy, before we let you go, I'd be remiss in not asking you about a couple of regions around the world, seeing that you were the former Ambassador to the United Nations for the United States.",
        "I want to ask you specifically about Sudan.",
        "Every time you take a step forward, it seems we take two steps backwards in that region, and it now looks that some of the fighting is moving from there and into Chad.",
        "Talk to us about again, trying to stabilize a region in an area that for years now has remained tenuous at best?",
        "Well, you know, Sudan is the size of the United States east of the Mississippi.",
        "If you went from Michigan and Ohio all the way back to New York and from Maine all the way down to Florida, that's about the size of the Sudan, and the problem is that there are no roads.",
        "The government, which would be located in the north, say right around where Washington is, doesn't have a lot of control and these regional warlords really just exploit the situation.",

        "In fact, we're getting more of our oil from Africa now then we are from the Middle East, but the oil that we're getting from Africa, we put no investment out for the country.",
        "We contribute little or nothing to the security of any of these regions, and I think it's going to come back to haunt us.",
        "We have heard, particularly over the last 12 months or so, questions about whether or not the United Nations as we know it today is obsolete, whether or not it is a working unit, a viable entity.",
        "You sit in a unique position, based on your relationship with the United Nations over the years.",
        "What do you think of that?",
        "Well, the United Nations is nothing more than the sum of its parts.",
        "When we were there and the Carter Administration had good ideas and was working with the rest of the world, and we never had to send in any troops.",
        "We never got anybody killed.",
        "I mean, I had to go to Africa by myself, without even a company of police, but my mandate was the talk with Nigeria, talk with Julius Nyerere in Tanzania, talk with South Africa and to see what we could do to bring people together.",
        "But it worked largely because there was a spirit, a style and a willingness as the United States as a leader to use the U.N.",
        "for the better for the rest of the world.",
        "The guy at the U.N.",
        "doesn't seem to understand what the U.N.--that he is the U.N., and nobody wants to put enough resources in trust so that the United Nations could really do something in Darfur.",

        "And they, more than non-Hispanic youth, say that being courageous is extremely important, and being a Marine - just being a Marine - outweighs any particular job or pay.",
