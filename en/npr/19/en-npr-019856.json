        "He got depressed, started getting in trouble at school and eventually dropped out of the program.",
        "Then, in June, 2012, a year after Salomon's high school graduation, President Barack Obama announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.",
        "Salomon applied and by the following year had a work permit and a driver's license.",
        "In summer 2013, he decided to try again.",
        "The first recruiters that I went to talk to was the Marine Corps - always, always, always.",
        "There was my recruiter - talked to him.",
        "He made me took the sample ASVAB exam, and I had a good score.",
        "Salomon says he was always attracted to the Marine Corps because they're portrayed as the toughest.",

        "But while recruiters routinely deal with diversity, not all understand the complicated immigration policies affecting those with temporary status like Salomon.",
        "They even told me, you know, there were people who came, tried to enlist, and we told them we didn't know anything about this.",
        "And then we really don't know what can happen or if we can enlist people with DACA."
