        "No, but I think the vocal quality is not just about - I mean, there are so many ways of evaluating what goes into a great voice.",
        "And I think, I mean, what the caller is pointing out here is - also issues of subject matter, how Waits is able to sing about something says a lot about, you know, how he can use his instrument rather than just a technical breakdown of, again, you know, what his timbre is, how clear his tone is, those kinds of measurements.",
        "Bryan, thanks very much."
