        "So let me see if I can do this, and I'll come back to your point in just a moment.",
        "Reverend Hagler, one of the things that is interesting is the want for many to talk about what the black church must do in all of this, not only in conjunction with working with the government, but reaching out to the community and questioning whether or not we have seen the black church be more, perhaps, reactionary than pro-action.",
        "What would you say to people who suggest that?",
        "Well, to a great degree, I would say that, you know, when we talk particularly around these disasters--I mean, one is--it's true we're seeing a great, great, great outpouring of support, of relief, from the churches of color, particularly black churches.",
        "More money is being raised and all the offerings that are going into the area.",
        "But one thing that is clear is that there's tremendous criticism.",
        "There's tremendous criticism in terms of the kinds of relief organizations that's supposed to be on the ground, of whether it's really, truly getting--and affecting the people who are in greatest need."

        "And preachers need to be prophetic.",
        "Preachers, instead of just getting into bed with politicians, need to lift up their voices and be critical on behalf of the people and on behalf of that which is just and right.",
        "And what about the question of the black church being reactionary than proactive?",
        "Even prior to Katrina, we start to debate that often.",
        "Oh, I mean, I think that there is a very reactionary quality in terms of the church in general, in that we tend to respond to issues rather than to frame a lot of the issues that we should be concerned about and dealing with.",
        "I mean, if you look at it, where has the organizing agenda been around the uplift and the empowerment of communities of color, particularly black communities, in the last 10, 15 years?",
        "We went to sleep on the--we went to sleep with Clinton, and we're still asleep.",
        "And, in a sense, right now we're being co-opted by the kinds of dollars that are flowing into churches from the federal government, and therefore, we are basically kissing Pharaoh's behind, if I can put it that way.",

        "Carruthers, let me turn my attention to you.",
        "There will be those who will suggest, and rightfully so, there are many, many churches on a local level that have been dealing with poverty, opened arms and opened doors.",

        "There is no doubt about it.",
        "And the Samuel DeWitt Proctor Conference is such an organization that represents interdenominational clergy, lay leadership, with a focus to do exactly what Pastor Hagler has suggested, which is to build the capacity of the black church to remain and sustain its prophetic voice.",
        "It's real clear that this is an issue that also involves--and this is why your conversation is so important--the fact that the media has also been one of the major barriers to the capacity of the black church to tell its story.",
        "And I would just like to say that, you know, we cannot measure a president's heart by his words, but rather by what he does.",
        "And so if you just look at the proactive stance of the White House relative to this crisis, they have been very proactive in terms of establishing the kinds of operations that allow for those who are the wealthiest to continue to benefit from this crisis.",
        "I mean, we just need to follow the money in terms of who's getting the no-bid contracts, the suspension--using the authority to suspend minimum-wage protection and affirmative action policies that would allow for minority business participation.",

        "You know, it is unbeknownst by the people here, people of color, that this particular president has already given over $22 billion to Africa during his first four and one-half years in office.",
        "And then he turned around and he gave over 15 billion more dollars to Africa for relief funds there.",
        "This president has also given more monies to social service programs in this country than any other previous president ever.",
        "Now I believe that his mouth is where his actions are.",
        "And if you were to follow the money, truly follow the money, and not listen to the rhetoric, you will see that this president's heart is good and that he has--the thing that he has in mind is black people."

        "So often, the church has been the mainstay when other entities failed us, if you will.",
        "Are we, do you believe, ready to take on the mantle of perhaps, as you suggested, being able to shore up our community with church activity and responsibility based on the ineptness or inability of other organizations to need for us?",
        "Well, I think that we do have the capacity to minister and be good shepherds for our community, to help build it up.",
        "I think that there's a lot of confusion, I need to put, on behalf of the black church, and that confusion is around politics.",
        "That confusion is around the kinds of monies we receive, the need to survive budgetarily.",
        "And therefore we make choices.",
        "We make choices that do not necessarily benefit the community.",
        "Also, we got a great problem with what I call this prosperity theology out there, this prosperity theology that talks about this pie-in-the-sky wealth rather than lifting up those on the bottom, because when you read the gospel of Jesus Christ--and hopefully that's what we're all preaching in the Christian church is the gospel of Jesus Christ--it talks about attending to the poor.",
        "It talks about empowerment of the poor.",
        "It talks about lifting up the least of these, rather than talking about how we gain trinkets and Mercedes and diamond rings and all those kinds of things.",
        "It talks about the quality and nature of the community.",
        "Because once you begin to ignore the least of these, you have lost the integrity of your community and you've lost your ability to do ministry.",
        "And that's really the crisis that we're in right now, and a kind of theological debate needs to take place in this country among the churches so that we can define who we are in order to get on with business."

        "Carruthers, do you believe that, as the media likes to suggest, that all of a sudden poverty was discovered after Katrina blew the cover off of it, as they ineptly put it, I think?",
        "Poverty has always been there; they've just chosen not to take a look at it.",
        "What of the idea of a wake-up call to black churches to say that while individual churches may be manning their neighborhood, their individual parishioners who may have fallen on hard times, etc., we should take a bigger role in making sure that we not only bring to light--keep the light on poverty that has been discovered by most of America, but also step up the effort to lift people out of this condition?",
        "I would agree, and I would also suggest that, in addition to what Dr. Hagler has already said, it is also important for us to see that we cannot not hold accountable the federal government in this process.",
        "We are taxpaying citizens and, therefore, there are rights and responsibilities to which we have not been given, particularly in terms of this disaster.",
        "And so it is important that the black church also not just take on the responsibility and the burden of all of this, but hold those accountable who really have the power and authority to make the difference.",
        "Reverend Dozier, what of the idea of focusing on not only what Ms. Carruthers suggested there, but one of the issues that remains first and foremost, and that is the identification of what churches are doing today by means of priority?",
        "The priority of the church, Ed, is this: The Bible tells us that Jesus Christ has given the church a mandate to take care of the poor and the needy, and the church must first and foremost do that.",
        "The church must feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty ones, give shelter to the homeless.",
        "The church must clothe the naked and care for the sick, and also visit those that are in prison.",

        "Go ahead.",
        "The important thing is, as was expressed, yes, the church is to care for the poor, but that's not enough because, really, when we examine the gospel, there is a prophetic tradition that causes us to preach and to organize and to push towards justice.",
        "As it says in Micah, we know what is good: `Do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with God.",
        "And therefore, we have to push, also, the governmental authorities to do what they're supposed to do to apply the law equally, to view people equally, to basically lift up all communities and not to be discriminatory, as we've seen after Katrina that there has been--or at least there is the perception, and I believe perception is reality, of a discriminatory...",
