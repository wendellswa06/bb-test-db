        "I just was wanting to comment that, of course, I'm in, you know, complete support of Mr. Savage being able to say his views, even though I think 99 percent of it I'm totally against.",
        "But what I was thinking would be a good thing to do in Britain and of course in the United States, if not worldwide, would be for moderate Muslims to educate the societies that they live in, especially if it's in a majority, non-Islamic state, to, you know, educate them about the realities that, you know, they live just like everyone else do.",
        "They have jobs, they have children and concerns like that.",
        "And that might calm down violent attitudes that people have towards all Muslims when it should be directed towards people who are terrorists, whatever their religious orientation.",
        "Okay.",
        "David, thanks very much.",
        "Michael Harrison, in this day and age, with all kinds of ways to listen to broadcast, I don't know that Michael Savage's program is broadcast anywhere in Britain.",
        "But if anybody there wanted to hear it, that would be dead easy, wouldn't it?",
        "I think so.",
        "The Internet has now sort of bypassed traditional means of transmitting a radio show.",
        "Anybody in the world can almost hear almost any radio show in the world, and sometimes at any time, because many of these programs are archived as Podcasts."

        "I don't agree with really anything that Mr. Savage says from a political standpoint.",
        "But he seems to make a pretty good argument when he says that liberals should speak up for him in the First Amendment idea.",
        "And my question, really, comes down to this.",
        "Is there an appropriate way for a Western democracy or Westernized government to be able to measure the reaction, and therefore the level of violence, that someone might elicit by the conversations that they have on a radio show.",
        "I just don't understand where the threshold is or where the point is when we say this speech is acceptable because it doesn't promote violence.",
        "And in this speech is not because it's an incitement to violence.",
        "I'm not sure, Michael Harrison, you're an expert on that distinction.",
        "Well, I'm an expert in as much as I know there are no experts on such a distinction.",
        "It's impossible to do that, and that's why we can't regulate speech the way we regulate how we slice bologna at a delicatessen.",

        "Michael Harrison, I'm just going to draw this distinction, in Rwanda, there were people who were on the radio, saying, go attack those other people, now.",
        "That's incitement to violence.",
        "That should be punished, don't you think?",

        "It's not just radio.",
        "Michael Savage is not the most dangerous man in the world.",
        "As a matter of fact, he's pretty low on the list.",
        "So it's crazy to think of a talk show in the United States presenting some type of threat to the sovereignty or the peace - the public peace in Great Britain.",

        "He's a big-time radio personality in the United States, syndicated on hundreds of stations across the country, and a big ratings-getter, and a big moneymaker.",
        "About 10 million people per week, so that puts him behind Rush Limbaugh and, what, Sean Hannity?",
        "He's behind Hannity.",
        "He's behind Limbaugh.",

        "Some would just come out - right out and say, we don't take Obamacare.",
        "Or the best one was, the doctor takes it here at the practice.",
