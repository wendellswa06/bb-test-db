        "It's - so the contact is so direct and so intimate that I think that lead singing is really the most maybe difficult form of music making, but also the most wonderful form, because there is no musical subject which is comparable to this intimate situation that you have as a lead singer.",
        "Of course, you're right about your performances in opera, yet you avoided opera for a very long time.",
