        "And I would love to have you comment on maybe the differences between working with small audiences - you talk about a very intimate setting of singing leader, and I do a lot of very intimate audience-type shows - and just the difference between that and doing, you know, very large audiences with, you know, symphonic and a much grander scale, the difference for you personally and how you feel you're relating to the audience.",

        "I think it's really very important that you are able, with your expression and your personality, to create this direct contact to an audience.",
        "I think that the times changed of performance - of performing changed a lot.",
        "Because in the past, we had these types of singer who was standing on stage like a statue singing their stuff, taking a bow, and went offstage.",
        "For me, for an example, it's very important, I talk to an audience, even in very serious classical places, like Salzburg or Vienna Musikverein or other big halls or Carnegie Hall, because I realized in every concert where I did this, that from that moment on, when I talk to an audience, the connection between me and the audience was much more intense in the second.",
        "So, I don't think that there is a huge, really huge difference for me.",
        "I mean, of course, acoustically, it's a big difference if you sing in a huge hall like Carnegie Hall or in a little chamber hall like Wigmore Hall in London where 400 people fits.",
        "But that's all.",
        "I mean, you have to handle every acoustic - I mean, you are a class singer or you are not.",
        "And I think a class singer of a special class has to handle this very professionally.",
        "Eve, thanks...",
        "Does this answering - I'm sorry, is this answering your question?",
        "Yeah, I'm glad to hear that the intimacy level is there for you, because I think that's true, when you are in a large performance, the audience needs to feel that you're singing to them.",
        "Mr. QUASTHOFF.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Each person really feels that connection."

        "That's a little secret that my teacher - well, it's not a secret - told me which was really very easy and it was that if you watch one people in the middle of the hall and looking into the face of this person, everybody feels touched, really, and it works.",
        "Eve, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "In fact, you wrote in the book that your experience of singing jazz in smoky clubs and playing in pubs and other places, doing material is not necessarily the great classical repertoire, that made it possible for you to realize that you're an entertainer, and made it possible for you to be a different kind of singer.",

        "Let me speak with Simon Rattle, again, who said once to me, there are people who have not only one talent, they have variable talents, and the only positive way of living as an artist, and even from the view of the audience, is if it's good, let him - go to Hell, let him do it.",
        "And as long as I have the feeling that I have something to say with classical music, or jazz, or so-called popular music - that doesn't mean music without nouveau, I mean, really good music.",
        "For example, even from American artists, I feel very often very sad that they are coming here to Europe with this Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, blah-blah-blah repertoire, and you have composers like Irving Berlin, you have composers like George Gershwin, which composed first-class, wonderful, beautiful songs.",
        "And I try to open the minds of the people a little bit that every kind of music can have the qualities, and I would be very bored if I would not have the chance to perform this - what I like.",

        "For example, doing Renaissance-type music or Gregorian chant or other such things?",

        "Especially the Gregorian music and Renaissance music needs this smaller vibrato-less voices, and I have a vibrato which is natural.",

        "That doesn't mean that I don't like him, but for me, it was always important to find my way of finding the approach to classical music and to lead singing.",
        "And well, the main important thing that I can only say, if you are a classical singer, try to sing lead.",
        "It is medicine for the voice.",
        "This is, for example, why we created - why I created with some friends a big lead competition next year in Berlin, here, from the 18th to the 22nd of February in Berlin, and we have a wonderful, wonderful jury, with Christa Ludwig, Brigitte Fassbinder, Helmut Deutsch, so great people to support lead singing and everything.",
