        "It's good to be back.",
        "All right, explain: Why are interest rates so low?",
        "But that strategy of propping up borrowers has a cost, and savers were the ones who had to pay it.",
        "So in late 2008, if you put your money into the bank in the form of a CD, OK, you did your part to help the economy by making cash available, but you just didn't get much of a reward.",
        "But all signs seem to point to the fact that the worst of the crisis is over.",
        "So, why not raise rates now?",
        "Well, it's definitely true that in the past year, the economy has stabilized - but stabilized is not great.",
        "It's still a very difficult environment.",
        "The housing market's very fragile, and if you raised interest rates, that would just make that market a lot worse.",
        "That means, here we are, we're stuck in a very low-rate period for a very long time.",
        "These days, if you could get even 1 and a half percent interest on a one-year CD, that's pretty good.",
        "But what about if you're willing to tie up your money for longer than one year?",
        "I mean, can you get more interest in exchange for a longer commitment?",
        "Yes, you can but, you know, that's only if you're willing to tie up your money for five years.",
        "And then, even at that, you're only getting 3 percent interest.",
        "That's really not much of a return.",
        "And there's one other thing to consider.",
        "You know, in an economy that's still as weak as this one, do you really want to tie up your money for five years?",
        "What if you lost your job later this year?",
        "A lot of people who thought they'd never lose their jobs did, so sometimes you might need that money."

        "The withdrawal penalties, if you take your money out of a CD, you could wipe out every bit of interest you earned.",
        "And depending on the circumstances, it's even possible that you could lose some of the principle - that is, the money you originally put in.",
        "Marilyn, pardon me, but this isn't fair.",

        "You know, the consumers, the homeowners, the businesses that borrowed way too much money a decade ago, they left the economy in terrible shape.",
        "It was so bad that the Fed had no choice but to bail them out by driving interest rates lower.",
        "But the end result is that savers who are the very people who did not cause this financial crisis, are now the people who are getting puny returns on their money.",

        "Yeah.",
        "So I looked over the past three years, United by itself increased its average domestic prices about 16 percent.",
        "But on routes where it used to compete with Continental and now they obviously no longer compete, we saw a huge increases - 65 percent and 58 percent between New York and Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston, really busy routes that saw quite dramatic increases that were far above what the airline did across the system on an average basis.",
        "And weren't the younger more nimble airlines, like Southwest and Spirit, weren't they supposed to be able to get into some of these markets and create some competition?",

        "Spirit says, you know, prices were high on that route already and that's what attracted them.",
        "Southwest used to be sort of afraid of going into other airlines' dominate hubs, but now they're going into Philadelphia, Charlotte, Minneapolis, major hubs that network carriers dominate.",
        "Southwest, over the last three years, has had the largest price increase on an average basis of any airline, so they have had to raise their prices considerably and don't always provide the kind of low-fare alternatives that they used to."
