        "So let's start with what you think were some of the major legal themes and trends this year?",
        "Well, I think one of the themes to really watch and think about is the sort of slow dissolution of the relationship between Congress and the president on legal issues.",
        "If you think about it, as recently as last March, Congress and the president were in lockstep intervening in the Terri Schiavo case to try to keep her alive over the wishes of her husband and the courts.",
        "Now flash forward to this winter, where we see a real, I think, severe disintegration in that relationship in terms of presidential powers, the refusal to reauthorize key provision of the Patriot Act, refusal to grant the president the power to torture that he seeks and this recent scandal about presidential surveillance of Americans, all of which, I think, is leading the Congress to say, `Hey, we don't agree with what the president thinks his powers are in wartime.",

        "The comment that was made about not profiling groups is very well taken, but the only alternative for that is for the FBI to know about groups so that it then can investigate people who are likely suspects.",
        "And the way they do that is by developing informants in communities.",
        "And they would do this in some cases by walk-ins, people that want to cooperate with the FBI; in other cases, they would turn people.",
        "But in any case, they have to know a lot about these groups.",
        "I would agree that the divisiveness created by actions like the Patriot Act is counterproductive because the only way the FBI can function is if the public trusts it.",
        "And in that sense, the Patriot Act has certainly kept the FBI from doing its job in that respect.",
