        "Today on the program, the second of our two-part series continues.",
        "We hear two opinions on what should be the government's response to security threats.",

        "Today, we move to the present and see what's changed.",
        "I'm joined by two experts who've written on the government's response to terrorism.",
        "David Cole is a law professor at Georgetown University, and Richard Gid Powers is a history professor at City University of New York.",
        "First to Professor David Cole.",
        "As opposed to the past, the '50s in particular when this country faced a national security threat, we are not interning people like we did during World War II.",
        "We're not punishing people for being members of groups like the Communist Party.",
        "So haven't we learned something from the past?",
        "Well, I think we have learned something from the past, but I think it's in much more significant ways we are repeating the mistakes of the past.",
        "So what we ought to have learned is that when the government sort of puts aside fair processes for distinguishing the innocent from the guilty, when the government adopts broad statutory violations like guilt by association or criminalizing speech or today criminalizing material support to proscribed groups, many, many innocent people get harmed.",
        "Many resources are wasted on people who don't, in fact, pose any real threat whatsoever.",
        "Professor Powers, what do you say to that, to the notion that not only do these new measures violate civil liberties but they're simply not effective?",
        "Well, I kind of look at it from a slightly different angle.",
        "I wouldn't advocate anything that minimizes or erodes American civil liberties, but I think that in both the McCarthy era and today, there was an effort to politicize a threat.",
        "No one would disagree that there is a terrorist threat today, but I think that the action on the part of the government politicized it and I think deliberately politicized it, so that something like 9/11 which should have actually unified the country in a commonsense reaction against terrorism, instead has split the country apart.",
        "The Patriot Act expanded the government's ability to conduct covert surveillance.",
        "It allowed for the easier deportation of people.",
        "Aren't those things that we need in terms of tools to fight potential terrorism, what you call, Professor Cole, preventive law enforcement?"

        "Well, that's certainly the government's contention.",
        "I don't think the evidence bears it out.",
        "I mean, for example, the fact that not one of the 5,000 foreign nationals who've been detained, largely using immigration authorities, turned out to be a terrorist.",
        "So these are misses, not hits, in terms of finding any actual terrorist.",
        "People look at 9/11 and they see who conducted the attacks and they think, `Well, if you're logical about it, you should go to the Arab or Muslim communities and look there first.",
        "So when is targeting justified?",
        "Well, targeting is certainly justified if you're targeting perpetrators.",
        "What's impermissible is to say because the 19 hijackers were Arab and Muslim men, we should treat all Arab and Muslim men as presumptively suspect.",
        "This is about the European refugee crisis, but the United States has a refugee crisis, especially at our southern border with Mexico.",
        "What do you want American audiences - when they watch this play, what do you want them to leave with?",
        "Thank you.",
        "A lot of her success was based on that department store marketing.",
        "And department store is not doing so well lately.",
        "Thank you.",
        "The next big trend we'll see is more mobility, so watching these events on things like iPhones and Blackberrys and on all the different smart phones that are available, I think we're going to start to see that in the coming years, that people are streaming right onto their portable device.",
        "You know, there's a DAY TO DAY editor watching a game online right now.",
        "Isn't this really a challenge for the workplace?",
        "It is, and guess what, Alex?",
        "Some employers are going to be blocking the Web stream.",
        "So that editor better watch out."
