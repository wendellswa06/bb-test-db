        "Yeah, I think there's a real pushing back in terms of both the questions about presidential power to just unilaterally set policy from things like torture that we talked about to the Guantanamo trials, labeling people enemy combatants and locking them up like Jose Padilla.",
        "All of those things are cases where there was once a sense that, `Yes, the president needs certain powers to fight the war on terror.",
        "Increasingly, not just Congress but the courts are pushing back.",
        "And I think the best example of that is the scuffle that's going on right now between the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals and the executive branch about Jose Padilla.",

        "He wanted to be sure to lay out the more idealistic side of our policy towards Iraq one more time.",

        "He's trying not to convert the people who think we ought to pull out right away or the people who voted for John Kerry a year ago; he's trying to get back the voter who was with President Bush a year ago on Iraq in general, but who has grown weary of the war and disillusioned with Bush.",

        "This was a very interesting political development because that redistricting map helped elect about a half-dozen more Republicans to the House of Representatives last year.",
        "What's going on here?",
        "What's going on really is the taking over of the Texas congressional delegation by the Republicans.",
        "It had been going on for a long time and it reached fruition last year, and now the court is going to review the map that was used to do that.",
        "It'll hear the case early next year, and it could issue a ruling in time to affect the 2006 elections, which would, of course, be crucial to who controls the House in the next Congress.",
        "The legal issue here says that the map, as it was drawn, dilutes the overall voting power of minorities in Texas--African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans--and that's constitutional grounds for it to be struck down.",
        "An earlier federal court upheld the map on this issue, and citing in part the US Department of Justice ruling on it.",
        "But we have since learned from a memo that was leaked to The Washington Post that the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division lawyers actually wanted to reject the map on that basis.",
        "They voted unanimously within their group to do that on the basis of its minority impact, and they were overruled by higher-ups during John Ashcroft's tenure as the attorney general.",
        "There's some participation here by the former House majority leader, Texas Congressman Tom DeLay.",
        "Political observers here see Gianforte as a solid frontrunner for the House seat Republicans have held since 1996.",

        "Oh, it certainly can.",
        "And that has to be its goal.",
        "What happened really under Louis Freeh was that the FBI internalized an extreme civil libertarian perspective and that, of course, was the situation most notoriously in the FBI's reaction to the Phoenix memo which proposed to the bureau that they do a nationwide canvas of flight schools to see if there was a pattern of Middle Eastern men taking flight training in ways that raised suspicions among their flight instructors.",
        "That was certainly commonsensical, and yet a supervisor in Washington said, `It smelled like ethnic profiling; the FBI isn't going there.'",
        "The larger scope, though, of the FBI's investigations since 9/11 have focused a lot on purported suspects who have gone to terrorist training camps or who have fought in Afghanistan or those kinds of activities with the assumption that they then would have turned those activities against the United States."

        "There are very few such cases, actually, but the most prominent case is the young men in Lackawanna, New York, who were taken up by a charismatic religious leader who got them to go to Afghanistan to attend a training camp.",
        "They came back to the United States and the FBI properly put them under investigation and conducted massive surveillance of these individuals for more than a year.",

        "And, Professor Cole, what would be your prescription then for how the government should handle this threat?",
        "Focusing on the enterprise, investigating suspicion of crime when you have suspicion, but not going out and sweeping up thousands of people who you have very little evidence on, rounding up large numbers of them and thereby alienating the very communities that we need to get intelligence from if we're going to find the actual terrorists and reduce the animosity towards the United States.",
        "I would say that that kind of analysis makes so much sense.",
        "But the fact that the administration did not go in that direction leads me to believe that they deliberately rejected a consensus approach and wanted to turn it into something that was politically divisive.",
