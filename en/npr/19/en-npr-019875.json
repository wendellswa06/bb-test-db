        "In the 1980s, her name was stitched into power suits worn by the new generation of women who were infiltrating boardrooms and breaking glass ceilings.",
        "Hers was the first company started by a woman to enter the Fortune 500, shoulder pads and all.",
        "If you wore a Liz Claiborne skirt or suit to your first day of work, give us a call.",
        "How did Liz Claiborne change your life?",

        "Nice to have you on the program again.",
        "Nice to be here.",
        "And remind us, before Claiborne came along, what was the uniform of working women?",
        "Well, I just want to say that actually, Liz died on Tuesday but it was announced on Wednesday, her death.",
        "I apologize.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "But before she came along, I mean, really, women's work attire was aimed at a woman who was attempting to climb the corporate ladder.",
        "And it was really that sort of John T.",
        "Molloy dress for success sensibility, which was women dressing essentially like men.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And how did she do things differently?",
        "Well, one of the things that was unique to her is that in many ways, she was like her costumer.",
        "I mean, she was a working woman, and she didn't really want to dress necessarily for the stereotypical boardroom.",
        "She wanted to dress in a way that reflected her individuality, the fact that she was a woman and not a man, and the fact that she also wanted to be fashionable."

        "Hmm.",
        "And she, of course, did not only change fashion, she changed the fashion business, not always comfortable with companies run by women.",
        "No.",
        "And you know, sadly, there still are not a lot of fashion companies of significant size that are run by women.",
        "And there are still very few female designers who helm these big companies.",
        "But one of the things that she really did leave her mark on was in the arena of department stores where she essentially pushed them to change the way in which they sold clothes.",
        "And instead of having the, the pants department and the blouse department and - a dress department, she really pushed to have her entire collection shown cohesively in one area so that people could see what her point of view was all about.",
        "And that's typically now the way that department stores present clothes.",
        "And it's good of you to be with us.",

        "And Eleanor, where are you, and what are you seeing?",
        "Well, I'm in the Montparnasse neighborhood where there's tens of thousands of striking workers moving down Boulevard de Montparnasse with their balloons and banners and chanting anti-Sarkozy slogans, and blaring rock music, as you can tell.",
        "And they're just saying, you know, this is social regression, we're not going to back down, and Sarkozy, you can't stuff it, you know, things like that.",
        "Right.",
        "And so what is the response from other people who are there and who have had to find other ways to get into Paris this morning and get to work?",
        "Are they supportive?",
        "Well, I just spoke with a woman in her bookshop, staring out at the demonstrators, and she said they're disgusting, they make me sick.",
        "So it seems that people, French people in polls show that seven out of 10 do not support the strikers.",
        "But when I asked the strikers about that, they say that's not true, they do support us.",
        "It's the media that's trying to divide people now.",
        "Now, the issue here is that Sarkozy wants them to work a few more years before they retire?",
        "Exactly, two and a half more years.",
        "He says that because there's too many of them and they don't work long enough, they work thirty-seven and a half years, but the rest of the French population is having to support their early retirement.",
        "Of course, if you ask people here about that, they say that's not true; our retirements support themselves.",
        "And they say the rest of French society should be trying to attain their level.",
        "Everyone should work thirty-seven and a half years.",
        "This is social regression, why are we all trying to work longer when the country's rich?",
        "And what about President Nicolas Sarkozy.",
        "Where is he on this?",
        "Is he willing to compromise at all?",
        "He said absolutely not.",
        "He cannot back down on this one.",
        "This isn't a really big reform.",
        "It's just a very symbolic reform and it's one he's always said he would do.",
        "And he's pretty much staked his presidency on this, and he says he can't back down.",
        "But these people, what they say is, you know, we don't earn a lot of money and we do work hard.",
        "We work under harsh conditions.",
        "And we signed up to this job because we knew we could retire early.",
        "And they also say this: it's us today, but in January it's going to be the rest of the French workers and they're going to ask you work 41 years, then 42 years, then 43 years before you can retire.",
        "You know, why is that they're picking on 500,000 workers who barely make anything at all?",
        "You know, I have to say, Eleanor, when I lived in Paris, strikes seemed to be a regular occurrence, and people kind of just shrugged their shoulders and got on with it and were in general - generally supported worker who went on strike, even though it was a massive inconvenience.",
        "But this time you seemed to be reporting something different.",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "I felt the same thing as you, and they pass them, like how come people are going crazy?",
        "People are just dealing with it.",
        "But I really - I was shocked by some of the people's reactions today, French people.",
        "They're just - they're fed up.",
        "They really seem fed up and I think, you know, they realized that some things in France have to change, and it's just 500,000 workers who get to retire two and a half years before everybody else, and they're - you know, they're holding the whole country hostage over it."
