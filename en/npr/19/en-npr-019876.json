        "Thanks very much.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "Bye.",
        "You know, Neal, one of the things that is sort of striking about Liz Claiborne is that now people look at it, and I think there's a certain segment of the population that doesn't really or never really consider Liz Claiborne to be, you know, a quote, unquote \"\"designer.\"\" They didn't put, they wouldn't put it in the same category as, you know, Chanel or Gucci, or something like that.",
        "But for her customer, I mean that really was a designer brand and she really was aiming at women who didn't have a fortune to spend on her clothes.",
        "And even now, when the industry does these, like, polls and surveys about the most recognized designers and brand names, Liz Claiborne regularly ranks way up there, far higher than a lot of brands like Calvin Klein, for instance.",
        "She also - and I don't know whether she was a pioneer in this or not, but she also had - would have several different lines.",
        "She did.",
        "I wouldn't say that she was necessarily a pioneer or not.",
        "But definitely there were a lot of different divisions of the Liz Claiborne brand.",
        "And as time went on and she retired from the company in 1989, Liz Claiborne went on to expand enormously, and now it's really a conglomerate, and includes brands like Juicy Couture as well as Kate Spade, as well as, of course, you know, the flagship, Liz Claiborne.",

        "What I remember, I graduated from college in '65.",
        "And the one thing I remember is that Liz Claiborne made clothes that we could afford.",
        "Up until then, the suits, you can have one and you wore it every day of the week, kind of like a uniform with - maybe a different blouse or you washed and ironed your blouse, because you couldn't afford it.",
        "But Liz Claiborne made nice looking fashionable feminine suits that we could afford.",
        "And for that, I thank her.",
        "I still buy her stuff, and it's also all very well made.",
        "I was going to ask, Val, if you stayed loyal to the brand?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Affordability, not to be sneezed at Robin Givhan.",
        "No, not at all.",
        "And sadly, it's one of the areas that now for the industry, it's not - it's a little bit of a dirty word to start talking about affordability and even for - to talk about the commercial appeal of a collection.",
        "Somehow that sort of seen as, you know, beneath a true designer.",
        "But for Liz Claiborne, it really was about this combination of practicality, commercial clothes and not forgetting that you could still have all that and still have clothes that look great.",
        "And Val…",
        "And it sounds so, you know, mundane now, but at the time, it was really something that was quite unique.",
        "And Val, I wanted to ask you - in her piece in the Washington Post today, Robin Givhan was writing about how Liz Claiborne also insisted that, you know, different pieces of her outfits could be mixed and matched and swapped out and - do you do that, and, of course, they made them even more affordable?",
        "Oh, she was the first one.",
        "I mean, you have to remember, I'm 64 and those of us who achieved executive status started - we didn't start with MBA, we started to be secretaries and became too invaluable for them to keep a secretary.",
        "I mean, that's how a lot of us, who are in my age group, came up.",
        "So, we weren't making big bucks.",

        "Well, you know, I've never really had a chance to sit down with her, because by the time I started really covering the fashion industry, you know, she had retired.",
        "But she had a reputation, certainly, for being really quite hands on and quite a powerhouse.",
        "And what people still talk about is the fact that she was not this sort of distant designer who delegate it but who really kept her hand in every detail, whether it was the Liz Claiborne line itself or it was, you know, an accessory or something like that.",
        "And so a lot of people, I think, now sort of look at Liz Claiborne and think that it's just, sort of - it was this sort of mass company that was designed by a committee, when in fact it really was truly the vision of this woman, you know, who have the signature glasses.",
        "And later on, when she retired, committed a great deal of her time to environmental issues.",

        "So, she had other issues as well.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "I mean, it was - it's definitely been a company that has not only sort of made its profits from working women and from women in general, but has also been very much focused on women's issues.",
        "So, I mean, it was, you know, she was someone who is very much aware of the fact that she was a trailblazer.",

        "When I was in my early 20s, I was a blue-collar part-time college student.",
        "And up through the years, Liz has always been able to fit in a woman's body, regardless of sizing.",
        "She's the type of designer you could always go back to and say, thank God, there's still somebody who really makes clothes for women out here still.",
        "So they not only look good, but they're comfortable.",
        "They're comfortable and, you know, back when I first started wearing my designers, I lost weight.",
        "Yeah.",
        "A hundred and twenty-five pounds.",
        "And now, I'm like 195 pounds, but they're still comfortable and look great.",

        "And just like a prize, Robin Givhan, comfort can't be overlooked either.",
        "No, not at all.",
        "And, you know, one of the things that, sort of, intriguing about Liz is that was the breath of her work.",
        "I mean, a lot of companies now tend to focus on a very specific audience.",
        "You know they - you often ask designers who's your customer.",
        "And they'll, sort of describe every woman in the world.",
        "But then, you look at the collection and you realize, no, your customer really is someone who's, you know, 25-35, and a size six, and is incredible wealthy."

        "She did plus sizes.",
        "And those - you know, the pricing always stayed very much in the middle, so that it was very affordable.",
        "But the idea that a woman who was a size zero, as well as a woman who was a size 16, could both wear that label, is something that also is quite rare in the fashion industry.",
        "You wrote in your story this morning that the company, after she retired - well, she had that vision.",
        "The company could not maintain the focus.",
        "Yeah.",

        "And in many ways, it happened with Liz.",
        "Instead of a single person, it was designed by a team.",
        "And in general, teams tend to design by committee, things get diluted, and it's not as strong as it once was.",
        "And I also think that, in addition to just a lot of missteps that the company itself made in terms of esthetics, a lot changed in the way that women thought about their work clothes.",
        "You know, there was much less of a distinction between work clothes and play clothes.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "So you would look at the - your female co-workers in their Liz Claiborne's and be envious?"
