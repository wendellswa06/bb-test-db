        "But - and I - you know, in a lot of ways, it seem like culture changed so much in terms of what was necessary for women.",
        "And Liz Claiborne, the company didn't really change quickly enough to keep abreast to that.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "You know, Liz had put a lot of its eggs in the department store basket, and when department stores had problems financially, there was a trickle down effect.",
        "And Liz Claiborne had trouble as well.",
        "So, you know in the last couple of years, they've really been trying to write that the company has a new a creative director.",
        "The first time it's really had one since Liz Claiborne.",
        "So it now does have a single person driving the point of view.",
        "And I think as one of the other callers had mentioned about how, you know, great the fit used to be and how comfortable the clothes were, they've recommitted to focusing on fit and trying to give women, you know, a place where they can loyally turn back to and say, I know every season, they're going to be great pants in that one.",
        "But we'll be going through many generations of Hollywood designers, fashion designers going back to Liz Claiborne stuff to recreate the 1980s.",

        "Thank you."
