        "So in other words if it gets hot enough those zirconium cladding around the uranium or whatever it is, that melts away, and then you've got the material itself exposed.",
        "Well, you know, anyone that you talk to here, even just at a simple 7-11 or just outside on a road where people are trying to just, you know, see what has - what damage there is to their home, you get a sense that - you know, you just multiply these stories, and you think this is happening to millions of people.",
        "The one person that I spoke to - and millions of others, are, in fact, without power.",
        "They're in - sleeping in near-freezing temperatures.",
        "This is a pretty bad state at this point, and teams of rescuers and disaster relief teams, they're even hard to find at this point.",
        "And they are struggling to find people in the rubble.",

        "But earlier today, one of the local newspapers in Kyoto, in fact, reported that 2,000 more bodies were found today in a prefecture just north of here.",
        "So you can imagine that a lot of places just haven't been visited, haven't been seen by a lot of disaster relief teams.",
        "So there's still a lot to find, and the death toll, of course, is going to rise.",
        "Some are estimating it's going to be in the tens - at least over 10,000.",
        "And we just have a few seconds with you left.",
        "Where are you planning to head when the sun comes up today?",
        "Well, hopefully, we can get some good news and reach some of the areas where people are actually coordinating disaster relief teams, and maybe there'll be good news there about what we find and people still alive in places that haven't been reached.",
        "Doualy Xaykaothao, thank you very much for your time today, and we appreciate your being with us so early in the morning.",

        "Right.",
        "Well, maybe I can just set the scene for you.",
        "So there's an earthquake, right, and the first thing that happens is the control rods go in and quench the nuclear reaction that's actually providing most of the heat.",
        "So you can think of these nuclear reactors - I used to think of them as somehow being magical, but really it's just a heat source that's heating water that's driving a turbine that's making electricity.",
        "They're called boiling water reactors.",
        "This particular one is called, yes, a boiling water reactor.",
        "Water goes past this hot nuclear reactor.",
        "It heats up.",

        "The steam powers a turbine.",
        "That's how it works.",

        "So the water comes back in, and then it goes back through.",
        "That's the normal way.",
        "Now, so they've shut off the nuclear reaction, but inside these fuel rods, these are cylinders of zirconium metal that have uranium inside of them and in some cases other radioactive material.",
        "But they're contained inside these fuel rods, right.",
        "Even when the nuclear reaction stops, the fission reaction stops, there's still some residual heat being produced by material that's left in these tubes, right.",
        "That has to be kept cool, and that's what the problem is.",
        "There are pumps that keep circulating water, even though the reaction has stopped, but those pumps failed.",
        "There are backup pumps powered by generators.",
        "Unfortunately, the generators stopped working.",
        "No power, no way to circulate water, things start to heat up, water boils off - not boils off but turns into steam because it can't be cycled through and collected back as water, and then the core, the rods of zirconium tubes begins to become exposed to the steam or whatever.",
        "And they're not covered by water anymore, and the temperature rises.",
        "And that steam, that is picking up radioactive material.",
        "The steam is picking up radioactive material if the zirconium tubes lose their integrity.",
        "And so yes, it does tend to pick up - and the other thing that happens is it makes hydrogen gas.",
        "The zirconium - it's called oxidizes.",
        "It takes some of the oxygen out of the water and releases a hydrogen atom.",
        "Hydrogen, as we know, if it's concentrated enough, is highly explosive."

        "That was hydrogen that was vented from the reactor to relieve pressure and entered a building that houses the reactor, and that's what - once it left the reactor, that's exploded, and so officials are saying the reactor vessel itself is intact, which is great.",
        "It's good news.",

        "But it's - there's an information bottleneck, essentially.",
        "And so everybody's trying the best they can to get information from whatever source they can.",
        "Now, it's appropriate for the International Atomic Energy Agency to be asking the same questions that you would naturally want to ask of me.",
        "And so maybe Japan feels that - the government feels that they would rather funnel the information through that agency.",
        "I don't know.",
        "And in the meantime, does there remain a potential that this could get worse?",
        "I mean, how long is it going to take these rods to cool off on their own?",
        "That's another question that we don't really have the answer to.",
        "Some of it depends on how much cooling capacity they're able to restore.",
        "Some of it depends on how long these particular fuel rods have been in the reactors and how much additional radioactive material has built up inside of them.",
        "So there's a lot of variables that affect that question, which is obviously a key question, and we don't know the answer.",
