        "Another no. We know there's been some because there have been radiation - heightened levels of radiation detected.",
        "You have to remember that there's always some radiation.",
        "I mean, there's radiation everywhere, it's just that it's in very low quantities and doesn't pose a health risk.",
        "Again, the question here is: How much is being released?",
        "We don't know.",
        "Which way is the wind blowing?",
        "That's a key thing because if this is being carried off by vented material, and the wind is blowing it out to sea, then it disperses over the ocean.",
        "If it's blowing it toward Tokyo, that's not quite as good.",
        "And then how much radioactivity or how many radioactive particles are in this smoke, steam, wind, what have you?",
        "And then are they the kind of radiation that can be inhaled, which is bad, or is this the kind that's just bad in contact or what have you?",
        "And then there's the examples of history, and most people think: Oh my gosh, Chernobyl.",
        "Right.",
        "Chernobyl is a very - most - every expert that we've talked to, and including people from the federal government, I think, have been saying this is not a situation that has a lot of analogs to Chernobyl except in the fact that they're both nuclear power plants.",
        "That one didn't have a containment vessel, and instead of being controlled by water to keep the temperature modulated, they had carbon tubes, graphite tubes - I think they were graphite, anyway.",
        "Carbon (unintelligible).",
        "And when the reactor began to overheat, because they were testing some cooling thing and it didn't work, these rods were actually capable of catching fire.",
        "So they not only had an explosion, they had a fire.",
        "They didn't have a containment vessel that would've put the fire out.",
        "And so anything that burned or was spewed off or anything from the core of the reactor was going straight up into the air.",
        "These are a different design of reactor, inherently safer.",
        "Nevertheless, it sounds as if there has been a cascade, one failure after another."

        "Yeah, it does.",

        "I'm hoping that the people who have analyzed this situation have analyzed it accurately to say it stops here because we have these containment vessels.",
        "If the containment vessels are breached, we can say, well, it's not going to get very far.",
        "If it gets very far, we'll have to change our story again.",
        "I don't know.",
        "I think there's good reason - I've talked to a lot of people, people who should know, who have bet a lot of their professional lives on the fact that this won't be that kind of accident, and I'm hoping that will be the case.",
        "And there's one set of reactors we're talking about.",
        "Could there be problems elsewhere?",
        "Again, there were pumping problems at three or four other power stations.",
        "None of them were as severe, and it seems that all of them were brought under control fairly rapidly.",
        "This one, it's the - it's a lot of events at once.",
        "In fact, the explosion today seems to have made one of the reactors have a new set of problems, one of the remaining functioning - not functioning, but one of the remaining reactors that hasn't exploded.",

        "They play, read books, take part in activities.",

        "Mr.",
        "McDONALD: Sadly, I think that is going to be the reality that we're going to see emerge over the coming days and weeks.",
        "We need to remember that a lot of children were in school or at kindergartens and childcare facilities at the time that the earthquake and tsunamis struck and were already, you know, away from their parents, who would have been in their workplaces or at home.",
        "And I think unfortunately we're going to see a significant increase of reports of children who have been orphaned.",
        "And as you set up these facilities, these might be considered sort of secondary responses after the emergency response to get food and water and power up.",
        "Your child-friendly areas are sort of a secondary effort.",
        "Mr.",
        "McDONALD: In some ways they are.",
        "What we know is that the primary survival needs for the people that have been affected by this are going to be catered for by the government of Japan, the Red Cross and other agencies that are providing shelter, water, food and so on.",
        "But what we also know from long experience is that children suffer quite acute short-term and long-term psychological impact from these kinds of disasters.",
        "And so the sooner we can get in and start to minimize the impact of that on children, the better the outcome will be for them in the long term."
