        "And he was impressed by how well the Japanese preparations for earthquakes have worked.",
        "He live on the fourth floor of an apartment building and the ground motion was so violent that his refrigerator was turned upside down, his gas stove ripped off the wall, but the gas supplies turned off immediately, automatically.",
        "He had a lot of broken glass, but he still - he hasn't lost power, still able to communicate on the Internet.",
        "And so it's certainly, you know, a serious, you know, major disaster even there.",
        "But anywhere else in the world - many areas that were almost unaffected in Japan are - have been, you know, damaged but really there was very little loss of life.",
        "He - many other parts of the world, there would have been fires everywhere, collapsed buildings and so on.",
        "And his building apparently is still livable and safe despite the damage and the extraordinary amount of earthquake movement.",
        "And if people the Loma Prieta quake near San Francisco several years ago, fires caused by natural gas were a big problem there.",
        "And it's interesting to hear that they have valves there in Japan that shut that off immediately.",
        "Right.",
        "And, of course, even just living there as an American - he's been there a few years and has been through a lot of their emergency, you know, preparation classes and training, so everyone there is prepared to respond.",
        "And, you know, I think what's most impressive to me as an engineer is just the way that the buildings have been constructed in a way that avoids collapse in most cases.",
        "Well, probably, you know, a lot of them did survive intact.",
        "It sounds like you're going to have a lot to learn from study of what did happen, in fact, to the buildings that were closer to the epicenter.",
