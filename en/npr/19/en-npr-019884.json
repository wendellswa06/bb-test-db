        "Give us an idea - help us understand what the numbers mean.",
        "Well, the most recent CDC report, which was released just this month, in February, sought to improve our estimates of how many children in the U.S.",
        "are afflicted with autism and closely related autism-spectrum disorders such as Asperger's Disorder.",
        "The study examined a total of 2,685 children, all of whom were 8 years old.",
        "They were from 14 different states, and the CDC researchers, based on reviews of health records and education records, found that on average, one in 150 of the children who were studied showed behavior that was characteristic of and consistent with a diagnosis of an autism-spectrum disorder.",
        "So why is this news, I guess you're asking.",
        "Well, likely because for many years, it was thought that the prevalence of autism was approximately one in 2,000.",
        "However, about seven years ago, a few epidemiologic studies appeared that indicated the prevalence to be far greater than one in 2,000, and one in 500 was reported."

        "And subsequently, the CDC partnered with the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2004 and found rates somewhere in between one in 166 and one in 500, but the media picked up on the higher estimate which created concern about a so-called autism epidemic.",
        "And subsequently, this study also shows higher prevalence rates than what we thought before.",
        "You said so-called autism epidemic.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that, you know, an epidemic medically has a number of different definitions.",
        "And it - I guess it can be defined fairly simply as a disease or a disorder that's excessively prevalent.",
        "I think that in the case of autism, when we never knew what the true prevalence was, it's hard to say that things are epidemic once we put them under heavier scrutiny.",
        "So you're saying it could have always been this high, we just missed it?",
        "Well, I mean that to a certain extent, that may be true.",
        "But one of the most-important features of the increase in the autism numbers has been a change in nosology.",
        "And by that I mean specifically broadening the definition of autism to include closely related groups of autistic-like behavior, such as pervasive development disorder and Asperger's Disorder - which are now included in the data sets and also included in the most recent CDC report that's used to calculate prevalence.",
        "Let's talk about the biological pathways that doctors think could cause the disease.",
        "What might be some of them?",
        "Well certainly in terms of genetics, which I'm sure we'll talk about a great deal.",
        "I'm very interested in hearing about that study myself.",
        "But you know, there is an existing notion that there are multiple pathways to autism.",
        "There's always been a strong, powerful link in terms of genetics that autism is seen as running in families.",
        "However, folks have also looked at cytomegalovirus and PKU, a metabolic disorder; and even toxoplasmosis, a bacterial infection that may result in behavior that either, you know, that mimics autism.",
        "It looks like autism.",
        "Again, the difficulty in diagnosing autism is that we don't know what autism is, we only know what it looks like.",
        "We're absent a biological marker, which is why this Autism Genome Project is so important.",
        "Before I get to the genome project and talk to Dr. Cook, I want to ask you one more question about the continuing drumbeat of people who believe that the mercury preservative in some vaccines, thimerosal, is linked to autism.",
        "Any more evidence one way or the other on that?",
        "Well you know, it's a long story with respect to thimerosal.",
        "It started back in the 1930s.",
        "It's a preservative, an ethyl-mercury preservative, that is used in vaccines to kill bacteria and fungi.",
        "About 15 years ago, it came under increased scrutiny when the EPA revised and lowered the reference doses for safe levels of mercury in the food chain, based on studies in the Faro Islands, where it appeared that neurodevelopmental outcomes in children were being adversely affected by the intake of organic mercury by their mothers."

        "Thank you for having me again.",
        "And so in the U.S., they expanded this to concerns about ethyl mercury, which is a metabolite of mercury.",
        "It's used as preservatives in vaccines, thimerosal being one.",
        "And subsequent to establishing some studies in around 2000, 2001, they were unable to conclude what a safe level of ethyl mercury was.",
        "And so as a prudent measure, they have gone forward, and the Institute of Medicine and the EPA and the FDA have gone forward such that all newly licensed vaccines after 1999 have not contained - must be thimerosal free, and now there are only trace amounts.",
        "Subsequent to this controversy about thimerosal and its link, the Institute of Medicine has concluded on the basis of several international and large-scale studies that there is no causal mechanism.",
        "Ed Cook, let's talk about this, your study, which is looking for a genetic basis for the disease, for autism.",
        "Tell us about - why look for genes that contribute to autism?",
        "Is there such a good family history here?",
        "Well, autism has drawn many of the world's premier geneticists to it because it looks so promising from a scientific opportunity perspective.",
        "Obviously, for those of us who are working with families with people with autism and that, that is a wonderful thing.",
        "So why would all these geneticists that could be studying something else be drawn to autism?",
        "The findings that lead to the interest are that if two parents have a child with autism, then the risk that the next child will have autism is one in 20.",
        "And we can put that in the context of the one in 500 number for autism.",
        "The one in 150 number relates to the entire autism spectrum.",
        "The risk for a second child or a subsequent child - each subsequent child - having autism spectrum is probably closer to 10 percent.",
        "So just focusing on narrow autism, the increased risk to siblings has gone from one in 500 in the population to one in 20, which is a minimum estimate of a 25-fold increase in risk to siblings.",
        "We put this in the context of disorders such as Type One Diabetes where the risk is about 15 to one and where the hunt for genes has been quite successful.",
        "That's interesting, but it's not sufficient because obviously the same language being spoken runs in family as well.",
        "Most compelling evidence is in the twin studies, in which if for identical twins if one has autism, the risk that the other identical twin has autism and narrow autism is now 60 percent.",
        "So we've gone from a risk from the population of one in 500 to the sibling of one in 20 - to now three in five.",
        "Now, OK, well that's fine.",
        "If it was a shared environmental effect then the non-identical twins or the fraternal twins would also have a three in five risk.",
        "But I think what's most interesting in why estimates of inheritability for autism end up in the over 90 percent range is that the non-identical twin of a child with autism is - has actually been estimated at lower than the sibling prevalence.",
        "Now I doubt that it's somehow protective.",
        "It's probably just an underestimate.",
        "But basically, there's no increased risk to the fraternal twin compared to the sibling.",
        "This very low rate in the identical twins is actually a very strong indicator of genetic factors.",
        "All right.",
        "We're going to take a short break and come back and talk more with Ed Cook and Rowland Barrett, take your phone calls about autism, delve a little bit more into this genetic connection and what kind of genes have been isolated and what might be the future of that study.",
