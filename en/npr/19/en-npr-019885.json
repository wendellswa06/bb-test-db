        "My son was diagnosed with autism around two years ago, typical, back in '94, '95, and the issue we had was being diagnosed with autism but then where do you get treatment.",
        "So it wasn't until he was 11 - he was nonverbal, or he became nonverbal - completely nonverbal - and then we found the Cleveland Clinic Center for Autism in Cleveland, Ohio and then they began treatment with him and within three months he was signing a song in church, a capella.",
        "So, but that's my concern.",
        "And now, of course, he's been in the school for a little over three years now with a great success.",
        "But my concern was not only the treatment.",
        "You know, we can - like a lot of parents who have children with autism, they're diagnosed, but what's the next step as far as, like, treatment, you know, education.",
        "But, you know, what do we - you know, diets?",
        "Is this an allergic reaction?",
        "Can we remove something from their diets to help them along and help those - help their functioning.",
        "So I'll take my answer off the air, or your comments off the air.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Thanks for calling.",
        "Dr. Barrett, any comment?",
        "Well, I think that this is not an unusual - not an unusual question.",
        "I think that number of parents have the same experience as the caller.",
        "And there is a broad consensus that involves the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Pediatrics, child psychiatry, American Psychological Association, among many others, that early and intensive intervention is critical to obtaining a favorable clinical and developmental outcome for these children.",
        "However, comprehensive early treatment regiments are very expensive.",
        "That would cost about $60,000.00 a year and they're not covered by private insurance.",
        "And what I mean by early intervention protocol: The ones that have been proven to be successfully involved anywhere from 20 to 30 to 40 hours a week of treatment, that's delivered in the home, by the way, and involves family members in an integral and critical manner.",
        "In contrast, most states run early intervention programs but most sates allow only for one or two hours of speech and occupational therapy per week.",
        "So the options that families have are very limited short of some movement that includes mandating private insurance companies to cover early and intensive therapies that are prevent to be effective, or expanding the autism waiver and autism Medicaid waiver in states that will allow families to participate regardless of their level of income.",
        "You know, Ira, the methodology to improve the qualitative of lives of these children and their families through this early and intensive intervention is available.",
        "Right now, though, it's a matter of to whom it's available and for how much.",
        "And this has to change, if only because in the long run it's going to prove much cheaper, both in terms of the human toll as well as the actual dollars.",

        "Hi Charlie.",
        "Hi, thank you.",
        "I guess what I want to know is - it may have been covered earlier but I wanted to get it more strictly: I gather that there's something called narrow autism and then there's the autism spectrum.",

        "Dr. Barrett?",
        "Yeah, actually you did get that right.",
        "Prior to 1994, autism was diagnosed on the basis of criteria put together in 1943 by Dr. Leo Kanner from Johns Hopkins.",
        "And subsequent to 1994, closely related groups of children who presented autistic-like behaviors such as were diagnosed as pervasive - having pervasive developmental disorders and Asperger's Disorder - were brought in to the group.",
        "So what has to be taken into account here in looking at the prevalence controversy is that the group of children that were allowed into the data steps using the broadened definition of autism had a much higher prevalence rate to begin with then classic autism.",
        "Broadening the definition was not a matter of bringing in a few more kids who were on the cusp of earning a diagnosis of autism.",
        "Instead, a very large group was brought into the mix, a group that by some estimates was at least 300 percent - or up to 500 percent larger than the original narrow group that was defined by the original diagnostic category of autism.",
        "Well okay, that's really - I mean, I was kind of guessing that, but I'm wondering - I'm glad to hear you explain that.",
        "What I really would like to know is, I mean, not that you want to - I mean, obviously, you want to treat people with Asperger's Syndrome or whatever they have, but has the prevalence of narrow autism expanded since, say, 1943 - and if so, how much?",
        "Well, that's hard - that's a very good question and it's hard to answer because one of the things that happened, for example, was that prior to the early 1990s autism was not a legitimate - what I meant by that, I mean, federally subsidized special education diagnosis.",
        "Hi.",
        "How you been?",
        "Not too good.",
        "So prior to - in 1993, there were about 23,000 kids in special education with -or 1994 there were 23,000 in special education with an autism diagnosis.",
        "Ten years later after the expanded definition, there were 193,000 kids in there with - in special education with an autism diagnosis although it was expanded.",
        "How many of those kids actually had more narrowly defined diagnosis of autism but had been labeled with mental retardation in order to gain the services prior to 1994 and then switched over makes manipulating the data set hard to interpret.",
        "Thank you, Charlie.",
        "Dr. Cook, where do you go from here?",
        "What do you do with this genetic information at the clinical level?",
        "Do you eventually expect to screen children - or prenataly - for possibly having autism?"

        "Well, we already know that they are relatively uncommon but some in the one percent or more range findings in genetics that can be tested for by those that would like to be tested even before conception, such as Fragile X disorder, such as duplications of chromosome 15 K11, K13 - The Prader-Willi, Angelman region and can be tested prenataly and can be tested afterwards.",
        "The question is how much - what will that percentage be eventually?",
        "Will it remain in the 5 to 10 percent range or will it increase further?",
        "My guess is it will increase further but will not ever reach the point at which we'll be able to prenataly diagnose all cases of autism or even have very what you would think of as a single gene test, which certainly keep coming back to this theme of multiple genes, even for the ones that are more major hits.",
        "Again, one of the things that this study found is that we did not find a new small recurring, say, five to 10 percent place were below the microscope level.",
        "We are finding deletions or increases in copy number.",

        "Oh, by not finding those?",
        "Yes, yeah, for those of us who don't know what that means.",
        "Well, it tells us that there were likely still be a large amount of autism in which it relates to about 10 or more genes conspiring to cause autism together.",
        "And that's a very interesting point that it raises because it means that if it takes 10 genes all to be risk variants to cause autism, number one, they maybe relatively common in the population.",
        "And it also suggests that when they're not conspiring the cause severe autism they may be contributing much of the diversity that makes our species so wonderful.",
        "So you have this contrast between something like Fragile X, which is equal to at least eight out of the 10 hits compared to other things where be lots of little risk variants.",

        "For example, it's going to be useful in the future when we go back to those 14 communities and then reevaluate.",
        "But it doesn't give us a national prevalence rate, and in some areas, it was considerably lower - the prevalence was considerably lower.",
        "And, you know, again they did this archivally.",
        "They didn't actually see the children to the best of my knowledge that they depended on records and it made the diagnosis based on behaviors that are the characteristic of the disorder.",
        "Now, those behaviors are still disabling and those kids still needs special education but often times when you're doing research like this that's archivally based, you end up with a spurious lining.",
        "If you went solely on a basis of the number of kids in the United States right now who receives special education services and with the diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder, the prevalence rate is one in 336 but that does not include kids who were younger than three years old who might have the disorder.",

        "And what we're trying to do is get more quickly to do a number, which is why this procedure within these 14 different communities in United States, although not representative of the national prevalence rate, is going to be useful as a baseline for further studies.",
