        "Naloxone is the brand name.",
        "So you're talking 20 times cheaper if you say Naloxon instead of Narcan - so I like to say Naloxon.",
        "And it costs, for 10 doses - 10 one-CC doses - it is $2.50.",
        "So it's extremely cheap, and it's a pure antidote - meaning it has no side effects whatsoever.",
        "It does need to be injected.",
        "There is some evidence that it could be orally sprayed - I mean, I'm sorry, inter-nasally sprayed.",
        "But it is only 80 percent as effective that way.",
        "But in the past six years we have taught people about how to do this.",
        "And these are people that have spent decades injecting, they know how to inject.",

        "And it's a very gentle experience when it's done inter-muscularly.",
        "And there are very few - of 457 reports of pure reversals now, only three have reported negative effects, that is withdrawal effects, associated with it.",
        "So it's a very gentle, very agreeable, very wanted solution to this problem.",

        "Or you take a realistic view of the numbers of people that use these drugs, and deal with that situation, from that point.",
        "Yes, well that is true.",

        "And understand that these are citizens too that need help and need assistance, and we should be out here trying to save their lives.",
        "So, you know, we have to take a totally different look at addiction in our communities and know that they are really the basis of most of the public health and public safety issues in our community, and we need to address it with a national and local strategy.",
        "Dan Bigg, some may be surprised with the number of deaths that we've reported - about 500 or so - and one has to believe that that number is probably smaller than the actual; often overdoses go unreported.",
        "When you look at the fentanyl epidemic one must believe that - and we've seen this historically with heroine in particular - that this is the latest fad drug as we tend to call them, and sooner or later this will go away and be replaced with something else.",
        "How do we deal with the idea that perhaps America is not looking at the drug epidemic as closely as we should?",

        "The state addiction treatment people were not invited.",
        "So the people that are trying to deal with this humanely seem to be locked out of the process of being part of the solution even when, as I said, providing people with the antidote -you know, a quarter a shot - is cheap and easy and it's been done for 35 years in medical settings to great effect.",
        "And people have been doing it in the streets here, and in many other cities around the country, yet we don't even want to look at it.",
        "So it seems to me that the consistent message we're giving out is life doesn't matter when it comes to drug users.",
        "Now that's kind of funny for the most intoxicating culture in the history of the world.",
        "So I would say we just need to stop being hypocrites and let's face our desire for intoxication as a society and say it's okay.",
