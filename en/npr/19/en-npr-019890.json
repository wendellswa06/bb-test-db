        "So in response there are thousands of cops on the street, large gatherings are outlawed, and there's a ban on the sale of gasoline in small cans.",
        "That's what the rioters used to make those firebombs.",
        "Which brings us to the circumstance of two Molotov cocktails that were apparently--which, of course, an incendiary device, homemade--were thrown at a mosque overnight.",

        "Any connection with the riots at all?",
        "I think that's unclear, but what is clear is the government is worried that any incident could set off things again.",
