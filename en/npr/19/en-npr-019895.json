        "But I didn't get all that much of it from him, when we talked about his time in prison - what he wanted to talk about - and what he did talk about was the gallantry of his fellowPOWs , and not - whenever I brought up something that I had heard about in which he had acted in a heroic way, that I heard about from somebody else, he would essentially confirm it in a kind of brusque way, but would never elaborate.",
        "And so much of this, much of what I have in my book about Senator McCain's - you know, the way he performed in prison, is from other people.",
        "But one thing that's for sure came from him was his explanation of how, of writing a confession, which he did after an extended time in prison in which he had been beaten, tortured, and essentially broken, as in fact, virtually every other prisoner of war there had been broken.",
        "Except he didn't know it at that time and when he wrote this confession - in which he wrote in very hyperbolic terms like, you know, say, I am a black pirate and, you know, I bombed hospitals which he never did, and talked about the great, good, wonderful, Ho ChiMinh.",

        "But as late as the '80s when I was interviewing him about this, you know, he talked about it as what he called the only blemish.",
