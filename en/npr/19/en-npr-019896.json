        "There's a famous Neanderthal that has arthritis.",
        "Daniel Lieberman, who studies human evolution at Harvard University, says that ancient specimen was diagnosed when anthropologists saw evidence of bone wearing on bone minus the usual protection of cartilage, a classic case of osteoarthritis.",
        "Now, a few years ago, Lieberman was putting together a list of diseases that modern humans weren't well-adapted to cope with like heart disease, near-sightedness and lower back pain.",
        "I wanted to include arthritis in the list but realized that there wasn't any really good data.",
        "So Lieberman asked his research fellow Ian Wallace to fly around the country and study human skeletons that had ended up in museums or had been donated to medical schools for scientific research.",
        "Wallace says the individuals died as long as 6,000 years ago.",
        "The oldest specimens that we looked at were some skeletons of prehistoric Inuit hunter gatherers from Alaska.",
        "The most recent were people who died in Tennessee in 2015.",
        "Conventional wisdom is that knee arthritis results from wear and tear, which is why it's more common among older people and those who stress their knee joints due to excess body weight.",
        "So going into it, I suppose my expectation was that people in the past, especially hunter gatherers and early farmers, would have had a much higher prevalence of osteoarthritis than people do today.",
        "But their study results published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that's not at all the case.",
        "And so, yeah, I was actually extremely surprised to find that it is more common today."

        "Yes.",

        "What they're saying is this is a binary choice between one candidate, Donald Trump - who is pro-life, pro- religious liberty, pro- conservative justices of the Supreme Court - and another candidate, Hillary Clinton, who has an opposite view on all of those issues.",
        "What I was wondering, though, is that we see that many people have a lot of anxiety about this election - do people come to you with those concerns?",
        "And if so, what do you say to them?",
        "There are some who have concerns, but I think most of our members are mature enough to understand that by voting for a candidate, they're not endorsing a particular lifestyle.",
        "They're simply voting on the issues.",
        "And, you know, I read just this week a Christian blogger who said she had been a victim of sexual assault and she could not support Donald Trump.",

        "The issue here is that Donald Trump, if he is to be believed, is saying that he imposed himself on people who did not wish him to do so, that that's the issue.",
        "It's not just that he said these things but that the allegation is he did these things, that he did put his hands on people.",
        "Well, and the key word there is the allegation is.",
        "I think everybody has to come to their conclusion.",
        "But the point - if you'll let me finish - that I was going to make is what you have to do then is decide.",
        "If you decide that what he said is true and that he's actually done those things, then you have to make a choice.",
        "If the answer is not Donald Trump because he has verbally or otherwise assaulted women, do you really want to put a woman into the White House who supports the greatest assault on women of all?",
        "And that is murdering them in the womb before they have a chance to be born."
