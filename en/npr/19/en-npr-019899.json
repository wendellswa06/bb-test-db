        "There were other costs to Kai's six-month stay in the NICU.",
        "The Shamiyehs calculate that the hospital bills added up to $11 million, though their private insurer probably negotiated a lower rate.",
        "There were also consequences for Kai's twin sister, Malia.",
        "Her parents' attention in her first six months was really focused on her brother.",
        "She had speech and physical delays.",
        "But at 3, she's already caught up.",

        "Wildlife officials say they have seen no evidence of a spill from the vessel, which was carrying tanks of diesel fuel.",
        "But the accident does raise questions about Shell's plans to drill for oil in the remote and fragile ecosystem of the Arctic.",
        "NPR's Richard Harris reports.",
        "When towboats lost control of this massive drilling rig during a big storm, it seemed possible that the story would end in calamity.",
        "Shell had spent $300 million outfitting this rig to work in the icy Arctic, and as it sat on the rocks, pounded by punishing waves, the worst-case scenario for Shell looked pretty bad.",
        "But yesterday, after officials decided it was still seaworthy, a tugboat managed to pluck it off the rocks with relative ease.",
        "Sometimes you get lucky."

        "Richard Burke is a former marine-salvage operator, now at the SUNY Maritime College.",
        "He says the rig's thick hull - built for ice - apparently helped it stand up to a week of winds and swells that could have destroyed a weaker vessel.",
        "And through it all, the Kulluk's hull apparently remained intact - a big plus for its recovery.",
        "Usually, it's harder.",
        "But I'm sure the salvage master is very happy with this outcome.",
        "Shell also breathed a big sigh of relief, though the story is far from over.",
        "The Kulluk was on its way to Seattle for maintenance.",
        "And once it ran aground, large waves damaged parts of the vessel's superstructure.",
        "Seawater also found its way into the rig's diesel generators, apparently through open hatches.",
        "Burke says if there is damage to the steal hull, that's often not too difficult to fix, as long as the vessel can get to a dry dock.",
        "And, Michael Cohen, you write about mission creep.",
        "What do you mean by that?",
        "And isn't it important to make sure that Afghanistan is not a place where al-Qaida can regroup and possibly launch another attack on the United States?",
        "Mr.",

        "COHEN (Senior Research Fellow, New America Foundation): Well, I think, first of all, I mean, if you'd go back and look in March when President Obama announced his policy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, he made clear that the goal was to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al-Qaida in Pakistan, what appeared to be somewhat of a limited counterterrorism mission.",
        "Since then, we've seen that mission evolve into a full-fledge counterinsurgency.",
        "We're now seeing, as you mentioned, General McChrystal talking more about protecting population then targeting the enemy.",
        "You're seeing reports of U.S.",
        "soldiers going out and targeting drug traffickers who are linked to the Taliban, even overhauling the Afghan prison system.",
        "And the possibility has been raised of bringing more troops than the 17,000 that President Obama sent in February.",
        "So I think what's happening is the mission is expanding significantly.",
        "And I don't get a clear sense from the administration they have a real sense of what the goal is.",
        "I mean, you saw this week Ambassador Holbrooke, who is responsible for regional policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan, basically when asked what does success look like, evoked the old Potter Stewart line about I know it when I see it.",
        "Well, I would hope to hear a little more - better sense from Ambassador Holbrooke and out of the administration exactly what the goal is there.",
        "And the other point about the safe haven issue, I mean I find this to be one of the problems with how we talk about Afghanistan.",
        "The simple fact is that there has been a safe haven for al-Qaida for the past seven and a half years, it's in Pakistan."

        "John Nagl, would it then be a better use of our resources, not necessarily military resources, but monetary resources and diplomatic resources to focus more on Pakistan than Afghanistan?",
        "Oh, we are, in fact, focusing the resources on Pakistan that we're able to focus on that particular theater in this fight.",
        "The additional counterinsurgency assistance to Pakistan has been very helpful, we believe we killed Baitullah Mehsud last week, and that's a very good thing in terms of better relations with Pakistan and bringing Pakistan fully on board in the fight against both the Taliban and al-Qaida.",
        "But the idea that we can withdraw from Afghanistan and that that won't have a debilitating affect on what the Pakistanis are finally doing to confront terrorism inside their borders, I think, is absolutely incorrect.",
        "What we do in Afghanistan has huge impact in Pakistan.",
        "And when will we know when it's time to bring the troops home?",
        "When will we know we've been successful in Afghanistan?",
        "I mean, I think the problem is that we don't know because, to some extent, the administration has not really defined what success looks like.",
        "I mean, in some ways, if you think about disrupting, dismantling and defeating al-Qaida in Afghanistan, we've kind of won that battle, because they don't really exist in Afghanistan in any serious way.",
        "I think we need to be clear to what our goal is in Afghanistan.",
        "Do we want to do nation building?",
        "Do we want to create a stable Afghan state?",
        "Or do we want to focus instead on containing al-Qaida in Afghanistan and Pakistan on -containing as best we can a Taliban takeover?",
        "And is there a situation under which we can accept Taliban playing a political role in Afghanistan so long as they are not harboring al-Qaida terrorist groups?",
        "And, John Nagl, as we said earlier, Richard Holbrooke said, we'll know it when we see it when it's time to leave.",
        "Do you have a clearer idea of when it'll be time to withdraw forces?",
        "I do.",
        "I think the key to success in this fight and the way we'll know it's done is just as in Iraq, where Iraqi security forces are increasingly taking responsibility away from American forces, and when we're going to be able to withdraw with some degree of success over the next couple of years, is in Afghanistan, when there are sufficient Afghan security forces to take the lead in the fight, and American forces can increasingly drawback and drawdown.",
        "We need to build a bigger Afghan National Army, bigger Afghan police forces in order to secure that country, keep pressure on al-Qaida and on the Taliban on both sides of the border and, ultimately, allow an American withdrawal with a secure, stable Afghanistan and Pakistan."
