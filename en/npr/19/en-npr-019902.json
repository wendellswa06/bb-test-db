        "Thirteen people were killed.",
        "One-hundred-forty-five were injured.",

        "Nancy Daubenberger is somber at this spot along the Mississippi River in downtown Minneapolis even as cars and trucks rumble and roar above her over the sleek, new interstate highway bridge she had a hand in designing.",
        "This is, after all, the spot where much of the twisted steel and crumpled concrete slabs landed when the former bridge collapsed 10 years ago.",
        "That was devastating and tragic and shocking and a very, very sad situation.",
        "The 35W bridge had been classified as structurally deficient, meaning it was in need of extra maintenance and inspections.",
        "In fact, some repair work was going on when it fell.",
        "And the 40-year-old bridge was rated as fracture critical, meaning the failure of just one vital component could cause the whole bridge to collapse.",
        "And it did.",
        "The National Transportation Safety Board determined it was a design flaw that caused the 35W bridge to collapse.",
        "Gusset plates that hold the huge steel beams together were only half as thick as needed.",
        "The NTSB also found the weight of the nearly 300 tons of construction materials stockpiled on the bridge deck contributed to the collapse.",
        "Daubenberger, a bridge engineer who is now director of engineering for MnDOT, says the state immediately inspected gusset plates on similar bridges statewide.",
        "And within months, the state raised the gas tax and funded a $2.5 billion 10-year bridge improvement program.",
        "The new 35W bridge opened just 14 months after the collapse, and Daubenberger says the state is on track to have all 172 other bridges identified as structurally deficient or fracture critical repaired or replaced by this time next year.",
        "Certainly we've done a lot to ensure the safety of bridges so that it doesn't happen again.",
        "But what about bridges in the rest of the country?"

        "So with federal revenue lagging in just the last four years, 26 states have followed Minnesota's lead, raising their own gas taxes to fund bridge improvements.",
        "And the number of structurally deficient bridges nationwide has dropped from nearly 74,000 10 years ago to fewer than 56,000 bridges today.",

        "And we have to put the investment in to maintain them, to rehabilitate them, to reconstruct them when needed and to replace them.",
        "The good news, Herrmann says, is that advances in bridge design and construction techniques and in materials make new and rehabilitated bridges safer and longer-lasting.",

        "Using satellites to measure fluctuations in the Earth's gravity, a team of scientists have found evidence of a huge crater - I mean a crater the size of Ohio - a mile beneath the Antarctic ice, and scientists think the meteorite that formed it is also the cause of the largest mass extinction in Earth's history."

        "Why was it found?",
        "Well, there had been reports back - let me see, it would be December of 2004, that came out of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, of evidence where people were suggesting that they had found fragments of meteorites and other evidence that suggested perhaps a crater in this part of the world."
