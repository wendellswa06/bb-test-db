        "Just like when you bruise yourself, over time the swelling goes down.",
        "Well, for the older craters, they've pretty much disappeared, but there's still some evidence of the signature of this at satellite altitude.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So it's a very broad, you know, categorization of the time interval over which it could happen, but it had to be over 100 million years, and it's probably younger than say a half a billion years, say 500 million years.",

        "How deep do you think this crater is?",
        "Well, I think it's very pervasive, so it's basically - it's raising up the mantle so, you know, the crust in this area's probably about 30 kilometers or so thick.",
