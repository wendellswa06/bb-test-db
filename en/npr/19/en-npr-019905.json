        "So she really did take a backseat for a period of time and then slowly began to try and work on those issues again.",

        "When she says this over and over again, is she making a fair or an accurate claim?",
        "It's hard to see really how it adds up especially if you listen back to that claim about at being the central core of her work for 35 years because in fact, her full-time job for a lot of those years in Arkansas was working for a corporate law firm.",

        "It has a committee to review judicial nominations, but the committee won't meet until next week.",
