        "The third directorate is the Directorate of Intelligence that produces intelligence reports and in the past was responsible for producing the President's daily brief, and that function at the moment has been moved up to be done by Ambassador Negroponte's staff in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
        "The Directorate, yeah.",
        "And the fourth directorate is the Directorate of Science and Technology.",
        "If the Intelligence Directorate is not necessarily providing the President's daily briefing, does its role change in other ways?",
        "It might.",
        "And keep in mind that the Directorate of Intelligence does a great deal more than just produce the daily report to the President.",
        "It produces reports on all manner of things that are of interest to virtually every agency of government.",
        "But if the President's daily brief is separated from the rest of the intelligence directorate, it's lost its crown jewel and my own view is that that ought to stay at the CIA, because it's imperative that we have an independent intelligence, analytical center that is not tied to any particular agency or department which has a policy interest.",
        "For example, if the intelligence analysts were part of the Department of Defense, they would be under enormous pressure to produce intelligence that supported the particular policy of the Secretary of Defense of the day.",
        "So it's imperative that we have a premiere, world-class analytical center that is independent of any other part of government so that they can speak truth to power and that's so much easier if the political leadership understand the importance of having independent advice, even when it is advice they don't want to hear.",
        "What about congressional oversight of CIA?",
        "This is one of the things that members of Congress have talked about a great deal since - particularly since the Iraq War started.",
        "It has been a concern of many members of Congress, but I also think too frequently this administration has been reluctant to really bring Congress into the oversight process as we've seen most recently in these disclosures about the supposed NSA program.",
        "Jeffrey Smith is an attorney and former general counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency.",
        "Thank you very much for coming in."
