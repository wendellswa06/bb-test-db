        "McCain's father had also been the Navy's liaison to Congress, in the 1950s.",
        "Hart says the younger McCain seemed like a throwback to that less-partisan era when politics stopped at the cocktail hour and at the water's edge.",
        "It was very much my impression that that's who he was.",
        "Where national security and the defense of the nation was involved and support for the military, that you didn't see it as one party versus another.",
        "You saw it as a consensus national endeavor.",
        "A few years later, in 1982, McCain won his first election to Congress.",
        "It was early in the Reagan revolution.",
        "But when other, more fervent House Republicans stormed the political barricades, McCain held back.",
        "He writes in his memoir that he often agreed with Republicans like Newt Gingrich and Vin Weber, who formed the Conservative Opportunity Society.",
        "But he had reservations about what he called their scorched-earth tactics and refused to join.",
        "Weber says in hindsight, that was no surprise.",
        "He does value tremendously, it has shown over his career, an ability to work across party lines.",
        "And the purpose of the Conservative Opportunity Society was explicitly to confront the Democrat majority and help bring us to majority status of our own.",
        "Another group member, Dan Lundgren, says McCain's decision not to join was more style than substance.",
        "John McCain could reach across the aisle and talk with people.",
        "But he also felt that, you know, we were on one team and they were on the other.",
        "Indeed, the American Conservative Union gives McCain a lifetime rating of more than 82 percent.",
        "But his work alongside Democrats is what McCain's best known for, whether it's teaming up with Russ Feingold on campaign finance reform, working with Joe Lieberman on global warming, or as part of the gang of 14 senators - both Democrats and Republicans - who brokered a compromise on President Bush's judicial nominations.",
        "That work with Democrats has earned McCain lasting suspicion, even animosity among the most conservative Republicans.",
        "GOP rival Mitt Romney tried to capitalize on that during the primary.",
        "McCain-Feingold, McCain-Kennedy, McCain-Lieberman are all three liberal efforts.",
        "I guess I think there's going to be a real battle here for which way the Republican Party is going to head.",
        "McCain won that battle - in the primary, at least.",
        "And at a town hall meeting in San Diego last week, he argued that Americans are tired of so much partisan gridlock."

        "People want us to work together.",
        "Early on in his House career, McCain was taken under the wing of longtime Arizona Congressman Mo Udall, a Democrat.",
        "He writes that Udall was uncommonly generous in helping a member of the opposing party because Udall believed he and McCain could accomplish important things together.",
        "Udall's son Mark, now a Democratic congressman from Colorado, says McCain has followed his father's example.",
        "The two shared a western pragmatism, Mark Udall says, and they shared a military background as well.",
        "When you serve in the Armed Forces, the last thing people care about is your political party affiliation.",
        "The first thing you care about is keeping faith with your brother, and now today your sister next to you; then your allegiance is to the United States of America.",

        "At the University of California at Berkeley, Silver studies ways to reduce those gases.",
        "That could create offsets that farmers and ranchers could sell to businesses trying to reduce their carbon footprint.",
        "One way to cork up those gases is to flood the peat land and grow a tall grass called tule.",

        "For example, flooding land may reduce carbon and nitrous oxide emissions but increase methane.",
        "So that's part of the reason we're looking at this, is how much methane comes out, how much carbon gets stored in, and is it sustainable.",
