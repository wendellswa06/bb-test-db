        "Comedian Dave Chappelle put together the concert that's at the heart of Dave Chappelle's Block Party because he wanted to hear the music.",

        "Chappelle lives in Dayton, Ohio, and one of the amusing conceits of this film is watching him give golden tickets to luck townspeople so they can come to the concert in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.",
        "Offering the biggest payoff is Chappelle's willingness to bring the entire Incredible Marching Marauders of Central State University's band to the concert.",

        "The concert itself begins with the driving beat of rap acts like Dead Prez.",

        "Well, for the answers to these questions and others, we turn to our reporter, Laura Sydell, who is covering the Consumer Electronics Show.",

        "Well, I think to most consumers, they're not really going to see the difference.",
        "The differences are things like how they make the product.",
        "So Blu-ray is actually a bit more costly.",
        "The biggest difference, however, is which companies are backing which technology.",
        "So Microsoft and Toshiba have been backing HD-DVD, and Sony is the big backer of Blu-ray.",
        "The studios say they like both technologies better than DVD because they're more secure, it's harder to steal them.",
        "But Blu-ray is even a little bit harder to make copies of.",
        "And in what ways is Blu-ray wining the race?",
        "Content.",
        "That's the key.",
        "Many of the studios were releasing movies in both formats for a while, and some studios chose only one.",
        "But now, Warner Brothers has announced that it's going to start releasing its movies only in the Blu-ray format.",
        "And that means that about 70 percent of the movies are going to be on blu-ray.",
        "So if I were a salesperson in a store and you were saying to me which player should I buy, the Blu-ray player or the HD-DVD, I'd be hard-pressed to tell you to buy the HD-DVD anymore."
