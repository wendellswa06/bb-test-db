        "And if you raise taxes in the middle of an economic downturn on anybody, especially the job creators, you make it harder to create jobs.",
        "And if you look at the proportions, though, of the top, top sector of earners in this country getting the bulk of the benefits, why does that help?",
        "Well, if you're a small business person in Tennessee, what this means is that you won't be paying tens of thousands of dollars, perhaps more, in taxes and you can use that to create a job.",

        "To what degree were environmental groups heard out by the task force?",
        "Well, it feels like from the reporting that we did for this story that that complaint had some merit.",
        "There was one meeting with environmentalists on April 13th, 2001, which was about two months into the work of the task force.",
        "And by that time, the task force staff had at least 40-some-odd meetings with a whole range of industry groups, lawmakers, et cetera.",
        "And what we were told for this story is that, at some point, some of the staff realized that it might not look so good if they didn't talk to environmentalists.",
        "And so they kind of hastily put together a meeting about two months into the process and invited the Sierra Club and some other people in the environmental world to come and talk to the task force.",
        "By the account of several of those people at that meeting, it was a fairly perfunctory meeting and I think what's quite telling is that at that point, a draft of the report was basically already done.",
