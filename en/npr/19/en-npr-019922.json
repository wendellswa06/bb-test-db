        "And you increase the revenues of the government by growing the economy.",
        "So this is one way to help reduce the deficit by getting revenues up.",

        "This is something that unfortunately at this point, the Fed is not doing a good job of communicating this.",

        "But rates fell about as low as they could go, and the recession continued.",
        "This fall, with the recession supposedly over but unemployment still high, the Fed turned to quantitative easing.",
        "Under the program, the Fed is buying up U.S.",
        "Treasury securities.",
        "By flooding the Treasury markets with money, Bethune says the Fed wants to bring down long-term interest rates.",
        "That improves the balance sheets of businesses, and makes credit cheaper for consumers.",
        "They're raising the net worth of businesses and households, which raises their creditworthiness, which then means at some point, banks will want to lend to them again.",
        "But the program is expensive.",
        "The Fed has pledged to pour more than $600 billion into the Treasury markets, and that has led to the charge that the Fed is printing money.",
        "Where does the Fed get the money it's spending?",
        "Bethune says it's simple: It writes a check.",
        "The money goes into banks across the country, and appears as reserves on their balance sheets.",
        "But Bethune says until the bank actually uses the money, it's not real cash.",
        "The only way that that would translate into a general increase in cash in the economy is if they say: We're going to start to do more lending.",
        "At some point, the economy will pick up, and banks will suddenly realize they have huge amounts of reserves to invest and lend.",
        "And that will be a potentially dangerous time for the economy.",
        "With so much money flooding into the system all at once, inflation could skyrocket.",
        "Bernanke says inflationary pressures are so low right now, there's virtually no chance of that happening.",
        "And anyway, he says, once inflation becomes a threat, it will be easy enough for the Fed to reverse course."

        "And so far, it hasn't paid off because the market is scared of it.",
