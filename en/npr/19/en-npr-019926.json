        "And Don knows where they are, and he will go barreling through St. Louis, in and out to some little place.",
        "Boom!",
        "He stops the truck and he gets in, there's the Walleye.",
        "And he loves the Wall Street Journal.",
        "I found it interesting, though, that that description we just read is 27 pages in.",
        "But well before that, in the book, you describe the truck and it seems to be as much a character as its driver.",
        "Well, I mean he just absolutely loves that truck.",
        "The truck is very beautiful.",
        "Its stainless steel tanks stretching way back there is like any mirror you ever saw.",
        "And it's in beautiful shape.",
