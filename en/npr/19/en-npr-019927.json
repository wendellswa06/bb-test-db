        "With the cost of newsprint, it's just a losing proposition to continue to add page after page of this agget (ph) that nobody really needs to read.",
        "Fitzgerald says several newspapers have been trimming back their stock and mutual fund tables over the past couple of years even at the risk of alienating some readers, because in this rapidly changing marketplace for news and information he says newspapers cannot afford to be in print what they used to be.",

        "In the majority of the cases, however, what we will see is the beginning of what will be a long process of investigations and cases making their way through the courts here.",
        "Do the politics of the military junta from 1976--do such politics still have adherents in Argentina today, and is there any concern that indeed there could be another coup over this very matter?",
        "No.",
        "The Dirty War largely left the military discredited here in Argentina and has a very, very minor role in the political life here in the country today.",
