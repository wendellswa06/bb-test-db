        "Historian, Judy Barrett Litoff, who studies the role of women during World War II at Bryant University in Rhode Island, says the couple were members of the largest escape network for airmen, the Comet escape line.",
        "What they did was extremely dangerous work.",

        "She even took airmen sightseeing around Paris where they would literally rub shoulders with German soldiers.",
        "She said she knew this was a dangerous sport, but that sometimes the airmen had to get out after being cooped up in the apartment.",
        "Also, we had to have the false papers made, their photographs on the false papers, and they just weren't allowed to open their mouths if you happen to go out because if the Germans realized that they were aviators escaping, I mean, that would be the end.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So it's a very organic situation for me.",
