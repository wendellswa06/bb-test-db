        "Well, I think there's going to be a trickle-down effect, and as I've said, the state Republican Party here, Neal, is better than any comedy act on the Strip.",
        "They have just had all kinds of problems.",
        "It took them forever to count the presidential caucus votes.",
        "They've just installed a state chairman who was essentially forced out of his city council seat, found guilty of ethics violations, has a real checkered past.",
        "And they've actually had to set up what I refer to as a shadow Republican Party, which is what the Romney campaign and the Dean Heller campaign are going to use.",
        "Whether or not that's just a sideshow or actually has an impact on turnout, I think it's too early to tell, but the Democrats still have an advantage because, as you know, Harry Reid won last time with a pretty amazing turnout machine.",
        "So did the Obama campaign in state in 2008.",
        "That machine is still intact, although the Democratic registration edge isn't as great.",
        "Mara?",
        "Yeah, no, that's exactly what I was just going to ask Jon about.",
        "I mean, Harry Reid has - the Harry Reid machine has a kind of mythical reputation.",
        "So did the Obama turnout operation.",
        "But of course in 2008, the Obama campaign had the wind at its back.",
        "Harry Reid did have to fight off a pretty tough challenge.",
        "What do you think about the grassroots operation there and the ground game?",
        "Is it really that good?",
        "And if registration is down, isn't that a sign that maybe it's slipping?",
        "Well, as a person partially responsible for that myth-making, Mara, I have to say...",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "...it was that good in 2008 and 2010, but you're asking exactly the right question: Will it be there in 2012?",
        "There's a couple of factors.",
        "First of all, the reason that the Democratic advantage isn't as great as it once was is not because the Republicans here have done any great job of registering voters.",
        "The foreclosure crisis, the economy here have caused a lot of people to leave, to fall off of the rolls.",
        "The attrition has hurt the Democrats disproportionately for a variety of reasons.",
        "So I wouldn't say that that's much of a problem.",
        "The real question, though, is whether or not there's the energy - as you mentioned, they had the winds at their back in 2008 - whether there's the energy down there at the grassroots level inside that infrastructure to go all out for Shelley Berkley the way that they went all out for Harry Reid.",
        "I'm not so sure of that, although because of the national significance of this race, because Harry Reid wants to keep that title, Senate majority leader, and this race may be key to that, I think it will be almost as good as in the past.",
        "But I do think that is something to watch."

        "Yeah, it is a disaster.",
        "We were, you know, as you know for decades the boom state, and then the bottom fell out of the housing market.",
        "We have this terrible foreclosure crisis.",
        "There are all kinds of estimates that 70 percent to maybe 80 percent of the people in this state are underwater on their homes, and that is just a huge issue in the presidential race here.",
        "That is why the president's numbers, which were good here, are no longer that good.",
        "Mitt Romney kind of leveled the playing field, though, when he came here and sat before one of the newspaper's editorial boards and suggested that maybe the foreclosure crisis should just hit bottom.",
        "It's bad enough that he said that to an editorial board.",
        "Of course in this day and age, what do they do at some editorial boards?",
        "They tape them.",
        "And then so they put it up on the Internet, and of course the Democrats now use that in a lot of their ads.",
        "So it's going to be interesting how that plays out.",
        "It's kind of, I think, a microcosm of what's going to go on in the sense that the entire Barack Obama campaign is, well, maybe the economy's bad, maybe you're not happy with what I've done, but the other guy would be worse.",
        "And so I think that's the campaign that's going to be run here.",

        "And George Allen, of course, has to answer for the question he never really answered when he was defeated in 2006, and that is why does he even want to serve in the Senate?",
        "He described it once as moving with all the purpose of a wounded sea slug.",
        "Of course, at the time, he was an unofficial candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and now, he wants to go back to this institution that he's not sure anyone can fix.",

        "Well, Virginia has been one of those states because it's, you know, Virginia is for swingers - they tell us - that the superPACs have been spending and spending a lot.",
        "The Rove-led PAC is up today with a fresh air ad backed by a million-six buy, and a lot of this has been used primarily as a place keeper for the Republican candidates; presidential level, Romney until his nomination was filled.",
        "And now, for Allen, now that that nomination has been settled.",
        "So we've been seeing, you know, quite a bit of traffic, and I suspect we're going to be seeing a lot more.",
        "Do you think it's helping both Romney in the polls, and Allen, at this point?",
        "Well, I'm not sure I can answer that question.",
        "I think I can say this, that it's definitely complicating things because no longer is the conversation between two candidates.",
        "It's between two candidates and three or four others.",
        "So Tim Kaine, for example, has spent a good deal of time and energy replying to, knocking down, refuting some of the charges that are leveled by the superPACs, principally in their advertising.",
        "And here - oh, I just have one other quick question, which I'm curious about everywhere, but particularly Virginia.",
        "Is there any evidence that the attacks on Romney both at Bain Capital for his tenure at Bain, and also when he was governor of Massachusetts, are making a difference at all?"
