        "On the other hand, Richard Mourdock, the Republican candidate, who spent Indiana taxpayers' money to try to scuttle the Chrysler bailout which would have put thousands of Hoosiers out of work is positively scary.",

        "And, obviously, Mara Liasson, the Democrats trying to hold on to that seat in Virginia, trying now to pick up Richard Lugar's seat in Indiana.",

        "I think that very early on in this cycle the Obama campaign was pretty clear that of all of the states that Obama won last time, they were willing to compete in all of them, except for one.",
        "They were willing to cross Indiana off the list pretty early.",
        "So even though Mourdock looks more vulnerable than a real centrist with a huge reputation like Lugar, I think that it's going to be very tough there, and I don't think the Obama campaign is not going to spend a lot of money trying to win Indiana.",
        "I think that's kind of a gimme right now for Mitt Romney, and I think that's going to affect, you know, Donnelly's prospects too.",
        "Mara Liasson, thanks very much for pinch-hitting today.",

        "It was not until the '70s that folks like Janet Yellen and others introduced women into, essentially, the research - just the research.",
        "I think that some of my work and others began to introduce black women, but by and large you're talking a white male space.",
        "Janet talked about diversity of ideas as well as diversity in terms of input.",
        "And what we often see - the Fed has done a great job under Bernanke to talk about holding interest rates down for economic recovery, especially since Congress has not.",
        "But at the same time, what we see is almost an indifference to the plight of African-Americans and people who are lower-income.",
        "Is that the job of the Federal Reserve though?",
        "Not necessarily.",
        "Well, I think the Fed, you know, they've got 300 PhD economists there.",
        "They've got an office of diversity and inclusion.",
        "I think here's their job - go out to some of the schools, graduate schools especially, and recruit.",
        "And let people know this is what you can do at the Fed.",
        "When I look at the Survey of Consumer Finance, for example, that reports on wealth - and the most recent one came out - 2013 came out early this year - they aggregate Africans-Americans and Hispanics or, basically, nonwhites, and the two groups have very different kinds of mobility.",
        "And I think that with an African-American economist were there, there might be something different.",
        "I worked for the Council of Economic Advisers in 1978, and I remember that there was a line on the unemployment data that said nonwhites.",
        "And with my lovely, diplomatic self, I went and said, well, you know, how come we can't disaggregate that?",
        "And they did.",
        "No one had ever said to them - I mean, I won't say no one, but I know that I fussed, and they said OK, we can disaggregate that.",
        "No one had ever seen that as a problem from their perspective?",
        "Yes, and when you have, you know, different kinds of indicators, it is kind of a problem.",
        "So I think with the Fed, it's not their job to count.",
        "This is not an affirmative action thing, but I think what it is their job to do is to do outreach."
