        "Tell us what that informal part means.",
        "Well, it's about all the kinds of ways that we learn.",
        "And I would say, we've been talking - I know in the information you've provided, talked a lot about children.",
        "But it's the way that our society supports people of all ages and walks of life in exploring and learning about science and technology and engineering and mathematics.",
        "So you mentioned many of the places, museums, science centers, you know, radio programs, television.",
        "I was fascinated, I - Flora's piece is one of my favorite SCIENCE FRIDAY pieces and I was fascinated to hear about the search for the imperial woodpecker.",
        "We've got a couple of free-choice science learners on our hands who are able to pursue their interests and hobbies around STEM.",
        "Are you learning?",
        "Do your studies show that more people are learning science outside of the classroom in these informal places?",
        "I wouldn't say more people, but I do think - and I wouldn't necessarily say that these are better places.",
        "But I think that what these opportunities do for children and adults is they help them understand at a deeper level some of the things that they have learned in school or they may get them excited about something that then they want to pursue in more depth in school.",
        "But there's definitely evidence in my work and the work of other people doing research on this area that these experiences can be exceedingly powerful.",
        "They're very memorable, and actually they connect often to other experiences that children and adults have in their lives, both in school and out of school.",
        "Linda Kekelis, you are director of a program called Techbridge.",
        "Tell us about that, please."

        "We don't always think of girls as doing that.",
        "That's right.",

        "And he was talking about this program that was really a hands-on program where girls got to build stuff and just get out there into the world of engineering and just, like, do what they have to do and learn about science, which you don't get to see a lot of girls engineering.",
        "No, you don't.",

        "And then, she taught us how to do a microscope out of, like, materials that were very tiny and then so that was really cool.",
        "I was really excited to learn how to do something that was also related to my schoolwork.",
        "And are you going to follow up and major in science in college, you think?",
        "I am definitely going to major in science once I go to college.",

        "Oh, I hope not, but I don't have all cheery news today, Ira.",
        "Actually, I coach a science Olympiad High School in Minnesota and I want all of my students, just like Norea, that are excited about science to go on and have a terrific experience.",
        "It turns out that nationally, the United States actually ranks 27th in the world in terms of the proportion of our college students that graduate with degrees in science and engineering and math.",
        "And it's not just because we don't have enough students coming to college excited about science.",
        "We're losing - in fact, nationally about 40 percent of all students who come excited and say they're going to be science or engineering or math majors graduate within five years.",
        "The rest don't.",
        "And if we break it down demographically, it's a little more discouraging.",
        "Students from underrepresented groups graduate with one of those degrees in five years at a rate of about 20 percent, so we're losing folks.",

        "But for a whole plethora of reasons, that seems to not be happening right now in undergraduate education.",

        "One of the things we're finding out is that the experiences that are provided in out-of-school settings can be extremely powerful and impactful for children and youth who are from underrepresented groups.",
        "And it's not clear exactly why that might be the case.",
        "Clearly, part of it is an opportunity to become very engaged and have the hands-on experience.",

        "And I think that that's a really important piece of this and the research supports that that seems to emerge.",
        "Also, knowing a scientist and knowing people that can give you advice, many of the young women in the study that I've been involved in with my colleague Dale Macready(ph) at the Franklin Institute, those young women are the first people in their families to go to college.",
