        "So Susan, last comment.",
        "It doesn't sound - it sounds like things are getting worse instead of getting better.",
        "Yeah, good job.",
        "And how about number...",
        "We find role models are really important.",
        "We do lots of fun hands-on activities and the girls tell us that, you know, they really enjoy the experience.",
        "It's very different from the school day, but they see those sorts of projects as hobbies, but not as career interests, so it really takes a role model who can help dispel the stereotypes that kids might have about who does science or engineering and also help share their passion for what they do and show girls that science and engineering can help make the world a better place, which is a very great interest to the girls that we work with.",
        "And what we've also discovered is that a lot of people want to support kids and be role models, but may not have the experience or the know-how for how to relate to kids or how to share their career, so it's really important that role models get support and training in advance.",
        "You know, we help them prepare for any classroom visit or field trip that they do with our girls and come up and share a personal story and help the girls relate to them, show that, you know, life is not all work, but they also have got, you know, hobbies and interests outside of work and family life that's important for kids to hear about.",
        "And I think especially for the girls that we work with who are from under-resourced communities, you know, being able to see the wide range of careers that are available in science and engineering are so important for helping the girls to see new possibilities and what they can do.",
        "Susan Singer, if you had to put your finger on one of the main reasons that college kids drop out of science and engineering majors, as majors, what would you say?",
        "Well, I think what happens is they're not feeling successful and they feel like they're working very, very hard and beating their heads against a wall and not making progress.",
        "And I think what we can collectively do in a way is like the mentoring piece, if we have better professional development for the people that are teaching them, to help structure their learning in a way that they make progress and feel good about what they're learning.",
        "So we need to teach teachers to be better teachers is what you're saying.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Right.",
        "We've learned that in K-12 and we're really starting to understand that in higher ed, where typically someone gets a PhD and knows a lot about the research field, but they don't know about how people learn or what kind of instructional strategies are successful.",
        "And as a new faculty member, you're just tossed out there and people want to do their best and they're trying very hard, but they don't necessarily have the resources.",
        "And there are a lot of programs that are starting to emerge, both during the graduate school experience and after that that are helping.",
        "And of course you may not see yourself as a teacher once you get in there.",
        "You're a scientist and a PhD."

        "That's traditionally how we've prepared people.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And you don't have the training to do that.",
        "So that's like your secondary job, you view yourself as, not as your primary job of what you need to do is to teach these students.",
        "Right.",
        "And most young faculty would like to keep their jobs and obtain tenure.",

        "Hi there.",
        "Hey.",
        "Well, I just wanted to say that I really think you have to have both programs going on.",
        "In my experience as a student, I liked science.",
        "I had good science teachers, but I also had the opportunity for a lot of experiences in museum programs and science camps and you would just going into museums that are some of the things that really stick with me.",
        "And I've also worked in both environmental education and then I taught high school for seven years.",
        "And it's a lot harder in the classroom environment to make it interesting and exciting, especially with situations like, you know, crowded classrooms, lack of supplies.",
        "And I think a lot of kids just never find out the interesting things about science if they don't get a chance for those hands-on programs and, like, experiences that really engage them personally and make them feel like they're discovering something.",
        "So I think you're definitely on the right track with this.",
        "The kids have got to have the opportunity for both.",
        "And I'm just starting a biology PhD program, but one of my long term goals is to really help support those programs that get kids involved in the interesting, like the exciting parts of science so they see what's going on with it.",
        "Lynn Dierking, any reaction?"

        "Yeah.",
        "I would absolutely say that I think something that we're beginning to understand and is starting to be a part of the conversation is how do we build bridges between what kids are doing in school with their out-of-school experiences and then how do we build bridges within the educational system.",
        "Building on what Susan said a few minutes ago, I was just at a meeting in D.C., actually yesterday and the day before, talking about how we need to better understand how children and youth move through both their in-school time and their out-of-school time and how they connect that to further education, further hobbies and pursuits.",
        "And so this is a conversation that's happening at the national level, talking about the fact that we can't just focus in on improving classroom teachers' abilities.",
        "We need to think about the whole ecosystem of education and really support undergraduate, graduate education, technical education.",
        "Something that came up at this meeting were the number of youths that are dropping out, and to the point where in some communities that are not even talking about K12 anymore, they're talking about K-8.",
        "Well, how do we reach children and youth who are disengaged and not even in the school system?",
        "So I think these notions of how we can connect and talk to one another in these different educational settings is really important.",
        "All right.",
        "That's depressing to hear, K-8 versus K-12.",
        "Indeed it is.",
        "Wow.",
        "So people aren't even getting a high school education - many more people are not getting a high school education.",
        "They're trying to reach them before they get to the 8th grade.",
        "Yup, yup.",
        "And once again, that relates to these statistics that Susan was sharing.",
        "I mean, 50 percent of the children in school don't move on.",
        "They may get a high school diploma, but they don't move on into the system.",
        "And then, of course, the ones that do get there, the sobering statistic Susan was sharing about how many of them don't complete their degrees, is very, you know, very sobering.",
        "Well, I think the situation is serious, but I tend to be more optimistic than that.",
        "I think there is a growing awareness of this and I think there's a collective will at all levels of education and an evidence base that's out there about what we can do.",
        "And I think we're collectively going to find a way to do this.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "With the resources we have?",
        "Well, that's the sticking point, Ira."

        "Thanks for being here.",
        "What have your sources told you about how this FBI investigation into whether President Trump might have been acting on behalf of Russia came about?",
        "Well, the way it's been explained to me is that in 2016, Trump had made a - you know, a number of statements, you know, asking Russia to give - you know, provide - make public Hillary Clinton emails that had been deleted.",
        "And there were another series of events - you know, Trump's meeting with former director James Comey and asking him to end the Flynn investigation.",
        "And so this reaches a crescendo with the firing of Mr. Comey on May 9, 2017.",
        "And in the letter that the president drafts, you know, he talks about the Russia investigation.",
        "And then, the very next day, he does an interview on NBC News with anchor Lester Holt and tells the American public and the FBI, I did it because of Russia."

        "And that was the tipping point for the FBI.",

        "And the investigation had two elements - a criminal element, which was the actual obstruction, right, and whether the president was obstructing a national security investigation.",
        "And then there was a counterintelligence element, and that involved whether the president himself had witting or unwittingly, you know, worked on behalf of Russia.",
