        "Right.",
        "And I think that - and this is true - and in fact with the Broncos, not just the best offense, it's the best all-time offense - 606 points in the regular season.",
        "And that alone convinces some people that what's happened so far is past is prologue and is going to predict the game.",
        "But I, you know, in the week leading up to the game there's so much talk, and so much of it is statistically based.",
        "But I just always come back to the fact that in the sport of football there are only 16 games.",
        "It's an extremely small sample size.",
        "So, I'm not saying that Denver doesn't have a great offense.",
        "I'm not saying that Seattle doesn't have a defense that held opponents to 14 points.",
        "But, you know, when you talk about baseball, that's 160 games; when you talk about basketball, it's 81 games, plus they play, you know, almost 20 games before they get to the Finals.",
        "I just don't think that statistical set that we see is that indicative.",
        "And then add to the fact, you know, the Broncos and Seahawks have both played 18 games but only against 13 different opponents.",
        "And the Broncos played against the second-easiest set of defenses and the Seahawks played against second-easiest set of offenses.",
        "So...",
        "So, you're saying this is a myth, that the Broncos don't have the best offense and the Seahawks don't have the...",
        "I think they absolutely do but I don't know that you can say, hey, 37.5 points in the regular season.",
        "That's all you need to know.",
        "That's far from all you need to know.",
        "What about the whole Peyton Manning claim?",
        "I mean, the greatest quarterback ever, right?",
        "I think that's, again, based on the statistic of going into this game he's 11-11 in the playoffs.",
        "Now, I get that, and I get the fact that he could be called the greatest player ever if he loses.",
        "But, you know, there is something too.",
        "There's been a backlash.",
        "There had been so many people writing that how could you even question Peyton Manning's legacy.",
        "Win or lose, he's one of the greatest.",
        "Yeah, but win, he is the greatest.",
        "It's the funny thing about legacies.",
        "I mean, two Super Bowl wins are an amazing accomplishment.",
        "If John Updike had won one Pulitzer Prize instead of two Pulitzer Prizes, that would be less notable.",
        "And it's weird - I was thinking about actors and directors and Pulitzer Prizes - the work was already done.",
        "So, in the case of, you know, an artist it's just someone looking at it and saying, oh yeah, you deserve a prize.",
        "But with Manning, this is his work.",
        "So, if the working isn't as good, it's like saying, well, if John Updike didn't write \"\"Rabbit, Run,\"\" would his legacy be a little worse?",
        "I think it would be a little worse.",
        "I think that's fair.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "You're not going to tell me who you think's going to win real quick...",
        "Yes, I pick Updike.",
        "Oh, no. I think it might be the Seahawks but I don't know.",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah, just because I think everyone's gone crazy for the Broncos.",
        "And they're great, but yeah."
