        "The one part of the Constitution I hold on to and I - it makes me shiver when I heard about the response Mr. Seidman got, is free speech.",
        "I would hate to see us - I think we can't afford - it's who we are - to let go of that even though we allow hate speech and even though it has awful consequences.",
        "We can't do the rest of it without it.",
        "Free speech...",
        "Without having an open dialogue.",
        "Mike Sideman, there are a lot of countries in what we regard as the developed world, Europe, that, well, for example, would bar any positive statements about the Holocaust or something like that.",
        "Thanks for calling, Maureen.",
        "I am a big believer in free speech, and I take advantage of it as much as I possibly can.",
        "But look, here's the basic point.",
        "If we're going to have free speech rights in the United States and if they're going to be vibrant and secure, we cannot have free speech rest on people being told, whether they like it or not, they have to accept this because of what some people thought 250 years ago.",
        "The only way free speech is going to survive in this country is if the people who believe in it defend it, not because it was a good thing 250 years ago but because it's something we desperately need right now.",
        "I would agree with you.",
        "I think that it's - I guess what I'm saying is you can't have the rest of the debate if you're not wiling to listen to - to allow people to see what they will say, even if it sounds awful to you.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Bye.",
        "There's a part of your op-ed that I want to ask you about, and that was the Constitution, as you say, has saddled us with a dysfunctional political system and kept us from debating the merits of divisive issues.",
        "How so?",
        "So why don't we take a divisive issue?",
        "How about health care?"

        "B says, but it's unconstitutional.",
        "A says, no, it's not.",
        "The framers would've liked this.",
        "A says, are you kidding?",
        "Look at what James Matheson said.",
        "And before you know it, we're off and running on a completely irrelevant conversation about what people thought 250 years ago, instead of about what we should be talking about, which is the merits of health care.",

        "But I don't think it's a particularly good way of talking about whether, for example, Obamacare is good for the nation or not.",
        "To make matters worse, Constitutional discourse tends to raise the temperature of the argument, so that instead of my saying, you know what, you and I just disagree about what the effect - the economic effect of Obamacare is going to be, somebody says, you're disobeying our basic commitments which make us Americans.",
        "And that kind of debate is just not helpful.",
        "We need to engage with each other instead of calling each other names.",
        "But isn't it the job of the legislative branch to try to decide which policies are right or wrong and economically correct?",
        "And the judicial branch, the Supreme Court, eventually, says, wait a minute, this is part of our Constitution or not.",
        "Well, I think it's - on issues - important issues like health care, I think it is largely a myth that that's what the judicial branch does.",
        "Many, many of the Supreme Court's most important decisions on things like Affirmative Action or the rights of gay Americans, they really have nothing to do with the Constitution.",
        "There's some mix of political ideology and political morality or philosophy.",
        "And maybe it's a good thing to have a body that does that, but it ought to be honest with us and stop hiding behind the cloak of the Constitution, which about - most of these matters has virtually nothing to say.",

        "Appreciate the chance to talk and I'd like to make a comment on what I'd like to keep in the - from the Constitution.",
        "I'd like to - actually I'd like to keep the whole of the Second Amendment, which specifically says: A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.",
        "So if there are people that wish to keep certain types of arms that most people have no interest in keeping, the arms and discharge ammunition rapidly, let's let them be in the militia.",
        "And let's fully honor the way the Second Amendment was written rather than having a selective honoring by certain factions in our country now, who focus on the right to keep and bear arms without infringement, without focusing on the whole language of the amendment.",
        "The militia part or the right to bear arms parts?",
        "The militia part has been lost.",
        "If people wish to bear certain types of arm, let's put them in them in our homeland defense militia, and let's make them - let's get them to train together.",
        "Because actually, if they function as a unit, a well-trained unit, they'll actually be much more effective to retail an invading army than they would be as individuals with high-powered weapons."

        "I'm afraid I'm going to be a little repetitious here, but it seems to me that what matters about the Second Amendment is what we ought to think about whether gun control is a good or bad idea, now, not in a country that existed a long time ago and no longer exists.",
        "And I think the Second Amendment is a good example of the real problems we get into when we start trying to consider these things as a matter of Constitutional law.",
        "So you have the spectacle of Justice Scalia and Stevens, spilling tons of ink over questions like what did the word militia mean in 1791; what does the word bear arms mean, or what did it mean to the framers?",
        "These questions are deeply irrelevant.",

        "And building more prisons, stiffening the law, lengthening the sentences just wasn't working.",
