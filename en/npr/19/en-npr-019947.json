        "These changes don't come about without investment, without money.",
        "Exactly, and I was just noting you had asked earlier what the state had done.",
        "They have spent $20 million on improving the community corrections facilities and programs, which means that you might actually go to one of those instead of prison, or you might go to one of those after prison so you can be in the community.",
        "You might just be able to go during the week, as opposed to weekends.",
        "There are a lot of different options at a community program to do, and the state did spend $20 million on that, and I think that's another reason they've been more successful.",

        "Glad to be with you.",
        "And I understand that at one time tough on crime could've described your position, as well.",
        "What changed your mind?",
        "Well, it's not so much a matter of being soft on crime as it is a matter of being smart on crime.",
        "What basically happened in my very conservative county is that the voters were asked on two separate occasions in the last 10 years to support a tax levy for the construction of new and larger jails.",
        "I am ready.",
        "And both times, by substantial margins, the voters said no. So I began to investigate other possibilities for dealing with the problem, and there is fortunately a wealth of evidence-based practices that are being adopted across the country that actually reduce the recidivism rate and also relieve jail overcrowding and do so by reliance on community corrections and by reliance on programs that expand education and job training for people while they are incarcerated and do so by keeping some of the nonviolent offenders out of prison in the first place.",
        "And it turns out that through our adoption of these measures in Ohio, we have substantially reduced our jail overcrowding.",
        "We are projected to save $578 million in avoided costs between now and 2015.",
        "And we now have the second-lowest recidivism rate in the entire country."

        "So these policies not only save taxpayers money, but they also are smart on crime because when you reduce the recidivism rate, you are being smart on crime.",
        "You are protecting communities, and you will have less crime than if you had pursued the old paradigm.",
        "Yet when - despite all this evidence showing that these kinds of reforms work, when you proposed your sentencing reform, that was not supported in the legislature.",
        "It was a tough slog.",
        "It took about three years to get done.",
        "I worked with both the then-Democratic governor, Ted Strickland, and then more recently with the Republican governor, John Kasich.",
        "And my biggest obstacles were: number one, the opposition of county prosecutors, whose role it is to lock people up and make sure they stay in jail; and secondly a great deal of timidity on the part of many of my colleagues who were afraid that if someone did not go to jail or got out early that otherwise would have gone to jail or not got out early, and that person reoffended, then that would be bad politically for them were they to vote for such a measure.",
        "And so we had to overcome that timidity by explaining that while I cannot guarantee zero percent recidivism, I can show that these kinds of policies reduce the rate at which offenders reoffend.",
        "And finally that won the day, perhaps because we were facing an $8 billion state budget deficit at the time, and...",

        "Yes, good morning.",
        "I was in prison for 20 months in North Carolina, back in 1999 I got out.",

        "There was a GED program, but I was educated, so I didn't need that.",

        "It was a horrible environment.",

        "I went in there for doing something stupid, and I didn't want to be stupid anymore.",
        "A quick question: You mentioned family.",
        "I'm curious, did family visit you?",
        "Was that part of the process that made you want to stay out?",
        "Because I found that I think the more visits with family, the more likely it is that someone stays out.",
        "Well, for me, that's contrary to me.",
        "My family basically abandoned me because they're embarrassed by my position.",

        "Even employment was very difficult to come by because there is legalized discrimination in this country for offenders or ex-offenders.",
        "It's a form of - I mean, to be an offender, you're handicapped.",

        "Thank you.",
        "And Senator Seitz, I think both of the callers we've had on the line who told us about their experiences emphasize something very important.",
        "Yes programs are important, yes education is important.",
        "Personal responsibility is also important.",
        "It certainly is, and that caller is to be commended for having the willpower to rise up and become a productive citizen, notwithstanding being abandoned by his family.",
        "So he is to be commended for that.",
        "Many folks don't have that level of willpower.",
        "One of the things that he said that's absolutely true, though, and that we tackled in our most recent legislation passed this June, is the obstacles that these folks face to finding gainful employment when they get out.",
        "And so what we did in Ohio this past June is pass a law that allows ex-cons who have kept their noses clean for some period of time after serving their sentence to go back to court and apply for and receive a certificate of qualifications for employment.",
        "That doesn't guarantee them employment, but they can take that certificate to any employer, public or private, and if that employer should hire that person, that employer will be immunized from tort liability on the theory of negligent hiring.",
        "That's important because many employers do not hire ex-cons because they are afraid that they, the employer, will be sued if that ex-con screws up after being employed.",
        "So what we're trying to do is facilitate individualized consideration of these ex-offenders who have rehabilitated themselves by removing a principal impediment to their employment.",
        "And it's just now getting under way.",
        "We'll see how it goes.",
        "But we think that's important.",
        "At the same time, what we did in our bill was direct many of our state licensing agencies not to automatically debar people from consideration for licensure merely because they had a prior conviction.",
        "They will now be required in most circumstances to give individualized consideration to what that crime was and whether it truly should bar them from licensure or whether they should be allowed to get a license for things like truck driver, cosmetologist, construction worker and so forth.",
        "And if there was - we're going to let you go in just a second, but I just wanted to ask: If there was one more reform you could enact by a wave of your magic wand, what would it be?",
        "Well, if I had a magic wand, I would wave it and demand personal responsibility among folks so that we never got into this situation to begin with, because I think many times young people in particular do not realize what a horrible existence awaits them in prison.",
        "So if I were to wave a magic wand, I would speak to mainly that younger cohort of folks and urge them to think twice before they do those things that put them behind the eight ball, oftentimes for life, either in the prison system or facing obstacles to employment and gainful citizenship post-conviction."

        "In fact, many states have already made double-digit percentage drops in their recidivism rates, that is their reincarceration rates.",
        "And we're seeing many states now following suit in terms of what Ohio's doing.",
        "So I think we are actually definitely headed towards a position where we used to talk about recidivism rates being this stubbornly high rate that was impossible to change, and now we're seeing many states across the country demonstrate that we can actually have a major impact on success rates for people released from prison.",
        "And I was looking at the statistics in your report, and the ones that stuck out for me, yes we saw all those percentage numbers, but there was also a chart that counted the number of people who did not return, statistically, had the recidivism rates stayed where they were.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, the point was made earlier that in many ways, states can't afford to keep growing their prisons.",

        "It is second-fastest-growing line item, second to health care, in state budgets across the country.",
        "And when we look at what's driving the prison population in many cases, it's the failure rate of people released from prison.",
        "And what we see is by making just small-percentage reductions in the failure rates, we can have an enormous impact on the prison population."
