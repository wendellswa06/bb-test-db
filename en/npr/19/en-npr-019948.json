        "The Pew Charitable Trusts, for example, calculated that just a 10-percent change in the recidivism rate in a number of large states would generate savings on the magnitude of hundreds of millions of dollars.",
        "And it's 1,200 people here in Ohio, north of that, according to statistics, that fewer people in prison than would have been otherwise.",
        "And Alan Johnson, as you look around the situation in the state, surely even - well, it was not your words but State Senator Seitz, who said timid legislators ought to be able to look at those numbers and see wait a minute, we can save a lot of money, and boy, the budgets are tight.",
        "Yes, and I think that is probably the turning point because I've covered this for a very long time, and they wanted, as I said, lock them up, throw away the key.",
        "But I think that they finally realized that this was just unbearable.",
        "And when I started covering prisons, there were less than 30,000, and now there are nearly 50,000, and that's down from a top of 51,000.",
        "So and it - I forget the rate they have to pay per day, the taxpayers, for this, but it's an enormous amount.",
        "It is, as Michael said, a Pac-Man that does gobble up an enormous amount of the budget.",
        "And Ohio just couldn't afford it anymore, and legislators I think finally saw the light.",
        "It's interesting, Michael Thompson, you can look at other factors, as well, the impact on communities of having so many people taken out of the community, the inherent unfairness, as some people see it, that targets certain elements of the community.",
        "But as you look at these numbers, why aren't other states doing similar kinds of things?",
        "Well, I think other states are looking at states like Ohio, at states like North Carolina and saying, we absolutely need to follow in the footsteps of those places.",
        "I look at a state like West Virginia, for example, just bordering Ohio, and there they're facing one of the fastest-growing prison populations in the country even though they have an aging population and not a fast population growth.",
        "In fact, I think it's level or even declining.",
        "And West Virginians are asking, why are we looking at building more prisons when, just on the border, Ohio and Kentucky, for example, have taken steps to actually check the prison growth and actually employ strategies that we think will buy more public safety than just simply on a path to building more prisons?",
        "Alan Johnson, even those numbers, as we pointed out before, are not stopping the mandatory sentencing, which keeps people...",
        "Right.",
        "...in prison for such a long time.",
        "There was one change administratively in the way the judges have to handle minimum sentences that has resulted in even longer sentences here in the state of Ohio.",

        "That went away for flat sentencing.",

        "They now have a modified good time credit.",
        "I don't call it that, but it's a credit that if you - involved in programs, you do education, you do training, you can earn a little bit off of each month of your sentence up to a maximum.",
        "So we've kind of rolled it back, and I think that's where he was talking about, the timid legislators earlier because that smacks of soft on \"\"crime,\"\" quote/unquote, which many legislators are still afraid of.",
        "But, again, it was the kind of unstoppable force, an insurmountable object, and they came together, and I think it's finally going in the right direction.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I actually believe that Ohio is one of the states that does have postsecondary education for inmates, and there are a number of states that really are emphasizing that and that we have seen an impact on recidivism.",
        "And I know a lot of people say, well, wait a minute, why should we be providing college education to someone who's incarcerated?",
        "But what we have found is that, as many folks know, it's really that - as one of the callers noted, who'd been incarcerated - it's that postsecondary degree that really improves the odds of employment.",
        "And frankly, it's other inmates seeing people in prison get a college degree that then encourages them to become literate, to get their GED because they realize there is a pathway out to higher education.",
        "But, indeed, many states do not have that postsecondary education opportunity, and I think we see real opportunities missed than to reduce recidivism.",
        "We're talking about the costs of corrections, a spur to reform programs and decrease recidivism.",

        "But during that eight years, what I had found is that there was a lot of men - because they started the programming for the re-entry, and there was a lot of programming in there that started to address like emotional healing, and not just the distorted thinking, you know, the criminal thinking because that's just - that's old, but fundamentally addressing the human issues of each individual person, of, you know, taking a look at their past, taking a look at how their actions and empathy and what they were looking at and how they were damaging themselves and community and family.",
        "And those programs were the most significant and produced the most significant change for me because not only did it produce healing in myself, it allowed me to effect a healing in those around me and my family and my network of people that I know.",
        "And now that I'm back in the community and off of parole, and now in school, mind you, and getting a degree in religion so I could become a chaplain and go back into the community and effect that same kind of change, that's how important these programs are because it fundamentally - and, I mean, it's a bad place to be in prison to begin with, and I'm not saying what I did was right.",
        "But what I'm saying is these programs fundamentally can change these men - because I've watched the change in them, myself included - transform their lives while they're in prison and give them a whole new perspective on why they're there and what they need to do to get out.",
        "In fact, it was Representative Condino, who became a parole board member, who gave me my parole.",
