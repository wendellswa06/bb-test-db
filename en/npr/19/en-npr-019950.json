        "So right now, in state waters, that's it's still safe to fish.",
        "Are there booms off the beaches there?",
        "There are booms off the beaches here, here in Pensacola Beach, even before for those who are familiar with the area, taking that three-mile bridge, you can even see the orange boom line across the bridgeway, and it's not hard to miss - to see the boom line - and just the backdrop of the shimmer of the water, and seeing these orange booms trying to stop the oil from getting close to shore.",
        "And I know this must are people sort of praying that the wind continues to blow offshore?"

        "They simply can't do this all on their own.",

        "That is questionable.",

        "They're there, they're surveying, and they're trying to alert locals as much as they can to be aware, like you know, the trajectory of where the oil is heading, and which - that is eastward, and making its way to Bay County.",
        "It is here for the long haul.",
