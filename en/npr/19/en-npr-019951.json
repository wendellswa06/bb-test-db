        "We have.",
        "To date, we've collected just about 300 sea turtles.",
        "Most of those have not been externally oiled.",
        "They've only had 32 live, oiled sea turtles - and three dead turtles to date.",

        "Well, we do have animals that die during just normal periods of time.",
        "These are greater than normal numbers, but we do have increased search effort out there.",
        "So we literally have hundreds of people combing the beaches and the shorelines.",
        "We also have the members of the public that are calling in sightings to an 800 number, but we do have increased numbers.",
        "What we're doing now is actually evaluating all of the animals we have, actually doing necropsies, or animal autopsies, on each animal that comes in to try to see exactly what their cause of death is.",
        "And what do you do with the ones that are not oiled, that are OK?",
        "Do you release them?",
        "We do.",
        "We do care for them.",
        "We don't collect them unless they're debilitated for some way - have some medical problem.",
        "We do care for them and release them, but we are taking them currently, we're taking them to Florida to try to get them out of areas where they could be re-oiled.",
        "The worst thing that could happen is, we put time into an animal, trying to return it to normal, and then send it out to be re-oiled.",
        "No, I can understand that and the frustration.",
        "Are they being tagged for identification as well?",
        "They are.",
        "Every animal that goes out is does have a permanent identification.",
        "One thing we do really stress during these types of events, even a small oil spill, is that we want to be collecting as much information as possible, from each and every animal that comes into our hands.",
        "By learning what we can, even in small spills, we can learn how to better treat animals in the future.",
        "And for this response, since it's so large, learning everything we can from each and every animal - be they live or dead - is really an important thing.",
        "How do you get oil off a sea turtle?",
        "We've read about people using Dawn detergent on birds.",
        "Is that the same process?",
        "It is the same process.",
        "It's less laborious than birds.",
        "I mean, with birds, you have to make sure you're washing them completely, and you have to get all the way down to the skin and the base of the feathers, and then rinse them completely.",
        "With sea turtles, it's a little easier.",
        "It takes less time, but what we're finding is we actually have to repeat the washing, typically on the next day, just to make sure all of that oil is off of them."

        "Well, I - my first tour of duty here was a month, and I went back to California for a week.",
        "I needed to deal with my oil spill program in California for a bit, and then I'm back here for another month.",
        "And so, we do have people rotating in and out from all over -literally, all over the country because we, again, don't know how long this event is actually going to last.",

        "At minimum.",
        "Even when the oil eventually stops coming up, we are anticipating at least several months more of cleanup.",

        "There is information out there saying that animals don't survive long term.",
        "And some of the earlier research studies that have looked at this have estimated average survival for birds after an oil spill is on the order of three to five days.",

        "This is a species that underwent extreme population declines in this region, and slowly but surely came back after the use of DDT was ended.",
        "So even if it isn't returned to the list, I think that the interest and the effort that go into trying to save as many of those species as possible is really critical.",
