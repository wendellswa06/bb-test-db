        "And, of course, really his fame came from being one of the visionaries of digital communications, understanding that information would be really the currency of the next age, that all information could be thought of the same way.",
        "All communications could be thought of as information.",
        "And the best way to actually transmit it would be digitally as ones or zeroes.",

        "They wanted to understand semiconducting materials.",
        "And in the back of their minds, some of the people working on this project understood that if they found something, they could replace these bulky vacuum tubes that amplified phone calls as they send them around the country.",
        "So the notion of is it just a replacement for the vacuum tubes or is it something much bigger.",
        "And as we know, its real greatest value in some ways is as a device - an active device on semiconducting chips.",
