        "Absolutely.",

        "Right.",

        "You know what?",
        "Actually, when they were doing the picture phone, the research department at Bell Labs was doing some big, extra research because they were always doing that.",
        "And what they discovered was that it's easier to lie to someone when you're talking to them on the picture phone than when you're just doing a simple phone call.",

        "It is right.",

        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "I actually got a couple of questions.",
        "The first question is, you know, I'm wondering about the Bell Labs' paradigm, and I wonder if your guest could contrast what that is with the idea of an organization that looks in places that haven't been looked at before or in ways that haven't been tried before.",
        "That's the first question.",
        "And the second question is a short one.",
        "You mentioned the transistor.",
        "I recall reading a report that somebody in the Midwest built a field effect transistor in the early 1930s and, unfortunately, could not duplicate it.",
        "There's some things he didn't understand, apparently, about the impurity.",

        "All right.",
        "Thanks for calling, Glen.",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, the transistor question - I mean, there were other patents.",
        "There's one famous one by Julius Lilienfeld, and there wasn't evidence that he had actually successfully, you know, understood the concepts of transistor action as John Bardeen called it, or that it was a successful device.",
        "And the Bell lawyers were worried about that then, weren't they?",
        "They were, indeed, yeah.",
        "Now, the first question, if I understand correct, the paradigm of this large organization, like a large research organization like that, yeah, it's - it doesn't - it was a product of its time.",
        "In the book, I sort of looked to that question.",
        "Well, what about Bell Labs was timeless?",
        "I mean, this - it was a monopoly, and we now live in now where the concept of monopoly is largely discredited, probably for many good reasons.",
        "But are there things about Bell Labs that are worth thinking about, that are worth learning from?",
        "Certainly, the idea that it could think long term and short term at the same time, I think are particularly valuable."

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "I mean, this was a company that was good at finding new knowledge, good at inventing things.",
        "They're also good at manufacturing things because any idea was eventually kind of transferred - any good idea was transferred over to Western Electric, the manufacturing arm.",
        "But on the West Coast, they picked up on all these ideas.",
        "And actually Texas Instruments, too, is a very young company, and the idea of putting not just one or two transistors on a chip but an entire circuit, which eventually led to these amazing integrated circuits, Fairchild and Intel.",

        "That had tremendous ramifications.",
        "It's almost hard to get our heads around what Bell Labs was today because it wasn't - it was a private company and a private laboratory, sort of, but not really, so they have this - they were - anything they were building, by agreement, had to be used for either the phone system or for the military.",
        "They couldn't just use transistors and start building computers, the agreement where the federal government really kept them to the telephone and communications business.",
        "So the notion was, do we share this technology?",
        "And, you know, reading those early memos from there, they felt, absolutely, they had to.",
        "It was almost part of their implicit understanding, that they were allowed - that they could use their invention for the good of telephone subscribers, but that it was necessary for them to share it and spread it around.",
        "So they allowed anybody who wanted to to come up for, I think, it was $10,000 or something like that, $25,000, come out for a seminar for a week."
