        "The National Retail Federation said sales were up about 9 percent for the long weekend, from Thanksgiving through Sunday.",

        "That's the day where online retailers really push to try to get you in.",

        "We don't have official data yet, it isn't all tallied.",
        "But every early indication is that people spent about $1.2 billion online.",
        "And that's about 20 percent more than the previous year.",
        "And everybody was expecting a pretty blah Christmas.",
        "What happened?",
        "Yeah, you know, it's hard to say exactly what's going on because again, all of this is just sort of happening right now.",

        "There are things - I mean, certainly the retailers have done everything possible to get us excited about those doorbuster sales.",

        "Are there going to be profits at the end of the year?",
        "If the only way to get people into the store or onto your website is to offer free shipping, big discounts; it's so competitive because people do have those handheld devices now where they can quickly comparison-shop, the price pressures are so intense that it's not exactly great for people who want to be a retail worker.",
        "Maybe the store owner is going to really try extra hard to hold down labor costs.",
        "They're not going to want to be generous with wages.",
        "If you were a manufacturer who's providing goods for the stores to sell, you're going to under intense pressure to keep your prices down.",
        "So, you know, this intense discounting, yes, it helps the consumer in the short run, but in terms of wages and the profit margins for retailers, it's still kind of a question what's really going on out there.",
        "So are they doing this as loss leader, to build loyalty?",
        "Well, you know, it's such an intensely competitive environment out there that if you don't cut those prices, people won't be in your store, and what you have to hope for is that if you offer a $199 plasma screen TV, that while people are in the store, they'll also pick up a little of this, a little of that; buy some batteries that you might have a big profit margin on or whatever.",
        "You want them in your store.",
        "So you've got to offer those doorbusters, but this ability that we have now to quickly price-compare, you can just look at what they've got in the one store and quickly go online with your smartphone and check what the other store has, and it really drives down prices.",
        "I think that for workers in the retail sector who hoped for raises or for a few more positions in their store, it's very tough."
