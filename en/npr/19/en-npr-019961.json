        "Weather can - you can always have a blizzard that wipes out a weekend and makes it tough for retailers to get into the stores.",
        "But there's one other thing that's happening this year that's just a quirk of the calendar: Christmas happens to fall on a Sunday.",
        "And typically, the Saturday before Christmas is a really strong sales day.",
        "So when Saturday falls on Christmas Eve, retailers are particularly happy because there are lots of last-minute shoppers, and they're off of work.",
        "They have the day when they can go out to the mall.",
        "So one thing, though, that - it's kind of good for the retailers because you can get those last-minute shoppers.",
        "On the other hand, for all you procrastinators out there who want to wait until Christmas Eve, maybe it will tend to get people to wait longer, wait for that last-minute sale and see if there's some doorbuster sales on Christmas Eve.",

        "The numbers may not prove quite as strong as what we saw this past weekend.",
        "But many retailers, at least, expect to see a better year than they did in 2010.",

        "One of the ways people are financing that holiday shopping is with credit cards.",
        "There's been a small uptick in credit card debt.",
        "Some stores also brought back layaway programs to help separate shoppers from their money.",

        "Even with 30 percent off and no interest, you have to pay that bill eventually.",
        "Eventually.",
        "It's really - you know, I was listening to the report, and I'm glad people are feeling a little more free to shop, but I worry that people have been pent up for so long that they will overspend, especially on credit, which is so dangerous when you're just coming out of the kind of recession that we just had.",
        "And the debt can mount up quickly, a lot more quickly than you can expect sometimes.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You know, the thing about it is when you use that plastic, and you're swiping, you're not giving a lot of thought, as opposed to when you have to, you know, peel off cash.",
        "You know, when you take cash, you - it's harder for you to separate from that money.",
        "But that plastic, you know, study after study shows that, you know, when you use plastic, you spend more than if you take cash.",
        "And the layaway programs, boy, I thought that went the way of Mr. Machine quite some time ago.",

        "You know, but the thing about layaway, it's better than credit, but it also can lead to people spending more because there's sort of this sense that I'm not really spending a whole lot because I'm putting it away early.",
        "And then if you put away stuff too early, you might miss those last-minute sales.",
        "So you need to also be very careful with layaway and also the rules with layaway.",

        "I guess they're getting to whatever - interest rates these days are pretty terrible, so they're getting some profit on that.",
        "But it's really a way of luring you into the store again and again and again.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I mean, the idea is that if you - you know, you don't - you know, the stores are saying okay, we know you don't want to use credit.",
        "We know you want to shop.",
        "Come put some things on layaway, pay it over time so that you can get out, which for a lot of people, especially people who have had credit card issues, it's a good technique.",
