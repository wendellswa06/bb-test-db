        "And was there - were there special discounts for Cyber Monday?",
        "Yeah, well, we've made a discount for the whole weekend to - we felt like we kind of had to to compete with any other stores.",
        "You know, talking to my family and stuff over Thanksgiving, some of them weren't going to shop in any places that weren't going to give discounts.",
        "They were just only looking for discount places.",
        "So that's what we did, and it turned out really well for us.",
        "So do you think it's going to be able to sustain?",
        "I hope so.",
        "You know, and this year we're not going to give a discount throughout the whole season.",
        "The last couple years we have.",
        "We felt like we kind of needed to just - because everyone was just looking for the sale.",
        "And at least what I'm hoping is that people will just shop with us for, you know, for the products we have at the prices we have and not just for a discount this year, hopefully.",
        "Marilyn?",
        "Neal, something that may change for online retailers is the sale tax issue.",
        "That's something that a lot of people - you know, the federal government is pretty starved for revenues right now, and one of the things that's happening is they're cutting back, of course, on funding for states.",
        "So state and local governments are, in turn, looking for sources of revenue, and about $23 billion a year in sales taxes are not collected because of online companies.",
        "There was a Supreme Court ruling in the early 1990s that said a company that didn't have nexus, that is a physical presence, didn't have to collect sales taxes for a state where, you know...",
        "So if I buy something from someone in Ohio, I don't have pay sales taxes on it when it arrives here in my home in Maryland.",
        "So that's a big advantage.",
        "You know, when I'm looking around, I sort of think: Well, gee, that's, you know, cut the shipping, cut the taxes, that's pretty attractive.",
        "But of course for the state and local governments, that's a real loss."

        "It's seven percent here, but I can tell you, I don't think people mind paying the sales tax.",
        "Most customers expect it and are surprised when there's no tax.",

        "So it is - were you surprised by the numbers over the past weekend?",

        "On the international freight side, things weren't looking good.",
        "So we were ready for it.",
        "However, consumer confidence, that increase today, in today's release, was a bit of a large increase and still at recessionary levels, but a pleasant surprise.",
        "Still at recessionary levels, and it's important to remember that there are other parts to the economy that still look pretty dismal.",
        "The home sales today, well, it looks like house prices are going down in most cities in the country – again - after a slight uptick over the weekend.",
        "But as you look ahead to the retail, do you think it's going to be able to sustain through Christmas?",
        "Maybe through Christmas.",
        "It's going to drop off a little.",
        "There's been a lot of early shoppers, and of course Black Friday and Cyber Monday look very good.",
        "So - and the dynamic in the retail space is very different than - it's changing year by year.",
        "So it should not be as strong for December or mid-December until Christmas.",
        "However, going forward into the new year, there are a lot of headwinds that consumers face, and that won't be that strong.",
        "And Marilyn, I know that you've written some concerns about the new year as well, even as well as this past weekend has shaped up.",
        "Yes, I mean there's still so much out there.",
        "We have more than nine percent unemployment.",
        "That's terrible.",
        "This has gone on so long.",
        "People have been out of work for such a long period that it continues to weigh on the job market.",
        "Even if you have a job, your wages probably haven't gone up very much.",
        "So there are real constraints on wages, and we've seen a lot of higher prices for food this year.",
        "But now, the one thing that has been good, is it's surprising what a big impact gasoline prices have on psychology.",
        "When gasoline was getting to be about $4 a gallon last spring, it was just a real weight on consumers."

        "That was, you know, it's still a lot.",
        "It's more than it was a year ago, but it's down so much from this past spring that I was surprised at how relatively low my gasoline bill was.",

        "That's exactly right.",
        "And whatever Marilyn said about consumer sentiment and consumer confidence and gas prices, we actually find that in our econometric statistical research.",
        "So - now, what is different this year on holiday sales compared to last year is that prices are higher.",
        "Wage gains are not keeping pace with inflation, price increases.",
        "And last year, holiday sales were very good.",
        "They were about 5.2 percent compared to the year, previously.",
        "This year, our forecasts are saying 4.2 percent, but about half of that gain is going to be due to higher prices.",
        "So what the retailers are doing, they're discounting, especially on electronics.",
        "They're discounting quite a bit.",
        "However, most of the gain or a good portion of the gain is due to higher prices.",
        "And in order to make up for all this - on low margins, they have to make it up in volume so - and it's a turf war.",
        "They're fighting for market share, as Marilyn said previously.",
        "Here's a correction we got by email from Keith.",
        "There are nominal service charges for layaways, but they're usually pretty reasonable since the store is sacrificing valuable backroom space.",
        "The service charge range is roughly five to $25.",
        "T.J.Maxx, for instance, charges $5 for the layaway.",
        "And if you don't pick up, will charge an additional restock fee of $5.",
