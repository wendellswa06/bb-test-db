        "First of all, the state of Texas controls the offshore territory, all the way to 10 miles out, making it very hard or at least harder for the federal government to step in if it wanted to, and so far it doesn't seem to want to.",
        "And second, Texans appear to be in favor of this.",
        "Remember, they're used to seeing oil and gas rigs in the Gulf.",
        "It's not a foreign concept to them, like a windmill might be to somebody in Nantucket.",
        "So the developers don't see much opposition to obtaining the federal permits that they're going to need.",
