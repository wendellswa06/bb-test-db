        "Mendell admitted that the cows were not being treated humanely, but said none of the non-ambulatory cows were processed, and therefore no unsafe meat left his California slaughter house.",
        "I also want to emphasize that it would be financial suicide for a company to harvest or process a cow that it believes to be sick.",
        "Generally, the company does not pay suppliers for the cost of a cow deemed unfit for human consumption, therefore, there are no financial incentives to bypass regulations.",
        "But then later, under questioning from the subcommittee, and they showed some of the videotape, he backed away from the claims that - from - in his written testimony - that no ill cows from his plant entered the food supply.",
        "And John, remind us what happened after the Humane Society's videotape came out earlier this year.",
        "Well, the agriculture department, which is - has an inspector on site - had to admit that it missed the company's practice of prodding and picking up cows that couldn't walk and sending them to slaughter.",
        "That's illegal because non-ambulatory cows carry the threat of mad cow disease.",
        "The department investigated found that the practice had been going on at this plant for two years and ordered a recall of all the meat that had come from the plant.",
        "That's 143 million pounds of beef.",
        "More than a third of it ended up in the school lunch program.",
        "The plant itself was shut down, laying off over 200 employees.",
        "Mendell was asked to appear before the same House committee last month, and he was a no-show.",
        "He appeared today only under a subpoena from the committee.",
        "The committee asked him why he didn't show up, and he said that he was too busy trying to save his company.",
        "So what happens next?"

        "The Army's hardest hit, blacks make up - made up 23 percent of recruits in 2000 that number down now to a modest 12 percent.",
        "Experts are at a lost as to why exactly African-Americans are no longer enlisting, but they say the drop has been padded in part by a hike in other minority sign-ups especially among Hispanics.",
