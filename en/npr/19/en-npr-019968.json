        "Fair enough.",
        "For playing our puzzle today, you'll get a WEEKEND EDITION lapel pin, as well as puzzle books and games.",

        "WNYC.",

        "Think of a place where you can find coins - in two words.",
        "Put the second word first.",
        "And you'll get a compound word describing most holiday cards.",

        "Over the long history of American conquest, Native Americans have been banned from many things at various times - practicing their religion, wearing their native dress, speaking their languages.",
        "For the last 200 years, they were also prohibited from owning and operating distilleries on tribal lands.",
        "It dates back to 1834 during Andrew Jackson's presidency, when he put in place racist policies based on stereotypes.",
        "This month, Congress finally lifted that ban, opening up the booming craft spirits industry to tribes across the country - tribes like Linda and Curt Basina's Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa.",
        "The Basinas have made history as the first Native American owners of a distillery.",
        "It's called Copper Crow.",
        "And they join me now from Bayfield, Wis.",
        "Welcome to the program."

        "Sounds great - I want to talk a little bit about this ban.",
        "Why was this ban in place to begin with, in your view?",
        "In looking at the 23rd Congress of 1834, it was an act to regulate commerce on Indian reservations and to promote peace on the frontier.",
        "What is your reaction to the fact that it's finally been lifted?",
        "What do you think the importance of that is?",
        "I'm ecstatic about it.",
        "I think it's real important.",
        "It's going to provide those tribes that are interested in pursuing distilleries as a means of promoting employment opportunities and educational opportunities, hopefully, for tribal members.",
        "One of the reasons that people have supposed this has been on the books for all this time is because, obviously, native peoples do struggle with alcohol abuse as do other communities in the United States.",

        "Well, I think, you know, yes, this is an issue that's not just on reservations today.",

        "We live in a very touristy area, so we hope to be a destination for those tourists to bring them out to our reservation.",

        "This was just the day before.",
        "And that was the sense.",
        "But then at the end of his speech, he says, you know, it's time for him to step out of the way and not simply block a national campaign effort because of the importance to defeat the Democrats on the war issue.",
        "That he feels it's important to have a Republican in the White House.",
        "At that point the boos started to come.",
        "And then the second booing occurred during the John McCain speech.",
        "McCain there mentioning how conservative he was time after time, trying to make the case, apologized for not having come to the Conservative Political Action meeting last year.",
        "But it just really wasn't a deal closer.",
        "Gosh, you know, just walking around there yesterday, people saying this is the guy that wanted to talk to John Kerry about possibly being his running mate in 2004.",
        "And, of course, they are still hot about immigration.",
        "Even when McCain mentioned it, there was booing about his stand in favor about some kind of path to citizenship for people who are here as illegals.",
        "Well, I'm struck by the idea that here's one guy in defeat and another in triumph and no one's happy with either one.",
        "It really is striking, because I think what you have is a Republican Party at sea.",
        "Even today President Bush did not endorse John McCain, which had been the McCain camps hope.",
        "Instead, he simply said we have to go forward and get the party to be unified in trying to hold on for this 2008 election."
