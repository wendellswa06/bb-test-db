        "She essentially said, oh, I drank a lot.",
        "I don't remember much.",

        "Exactly.",
        "And then she leads them essentially to five other people.",

        "So through another confidential informant they arrest a woman named Debra Shelden.",
        "From there on everyone else is implicated through dreams.",
        "So Debra Shelden is told to go back to her cell and to dream in order to recover her memories of what had happened at the crime.",

        "So how did that come into play in this investigation?",
        "He seemed to feel very confident that if someone closes their eyes and tries to take a nap or goes to sleep at night or just lets their mind wander they will suddenly come up with memories that had been buried that contained the details that were too traumatic for them to process.",
        "And this is a theory that has pretty much been discredited.",
        "But he told them this idea and taught them this theory.",
        "And you said it's discredited, but we're going back to the 1980s here.",
        "It was quite popular at that time.",
        "Very, very popular at the time.",
        "That was the era in which people were being told that some of their traumas were due to sexual abuse as children that they may have forgotten.",
        "And so there was this movement of therapists at that time who were trying to get people to remember through flashbacks and dreams and what was called memory work the details of their abuse.",
        "And it became a kind of epidemic.",
        "And once it reached epidemic proportions it was discredited as a theory.",
        "As we said, this crime happened in the '80s.",
        "They were exonerated in 2009.",
        "Why did you want to write about this now, especially as it's a discredited theory, right?"
