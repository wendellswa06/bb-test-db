        "These are social buying websites and their power is growing.",
        "Shoppers across the country are nabbing deals on dining, hotel rooms, spa treatments and recreation.",
        "Many deals are for local businesses, but both LivingSocial and Groupon have grabbed subscribers by offering deals from Amazon and the Gap.",
        "It's a new kind of shopping, some say, partly a result of recent economic travails and partly a whole new retail philosophy, where deal hunting is a sport.",
        "Later in the hour, as conflicting reports soar out of Libya, what's the impact on gas prices and how bad could it get?",
        "But first, social buying.",
        "If you're a retailer that's participated in these daily deals, give us a call and tell us how it turned out.",

        "I really had not been familiar with them until I was getting ready for the show.",

        "Sure.",
        "My article for Wired talks about two groups of Websites.",
        "The first is are sites like Groupon, which for a limited amount of time will let people buy a dinner out at a restaurant or jeans at the Gap for usually around 50 percent off what it would normally cost, which is a pretty attractive proposition.",
        "And then Groupon keeps half that money and the retailer gets the other half, which is half of half - or a quarter.",
        "The second group are these really, really granular sites, where people trade tips and can save 90-95 percent on their grocery trips by compiling all these advanced deal-hunting techniques.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I watched a very capable shopper in North Carolina buy about eighty dollars worth of groceries and they actually rang up a bell pepper wrong.",
        "And so, according to the store's policy, she got two dollars back, which actually put her into the black for the trip.",
        "So she made money shopping.",
        "And this was all by following established store policies - established coupon policy.",
        "She didn't have to break any rules",
        "Yeah.",
        "So just the listeners out there understand that this is -what we're talking is sort of online - in some cases, is sort of online coupons, right?",
        "Yes.",
        "Some of the coupons come from online and then also there're these forums, where people who get coupons from off-line; from newspapers and from the mail.",
        "You know, they gather together and they trade tips.",
        "And so they're able to become much more advanced and save a lot more money than they'd be able to on their own.",
        "Is there any explanation for why there's this sort of resurgence of interest in coupons at this moment?",
        "Well, the Internet's the medium that's allowing it to happen.",
        "But I think there are two fundamental trends.",
        "First, is the recession.",
        "People don't want to spend money and they're looking for way to negotiate prices down.",
        "And second, I think, sometimes the money's just an excuse."

        "The other problem is that shopping is a little bit boring and a lot of our landscape is this kind of, you know, blah strip mall, strip mall shopping.",
        "And consumers are looking for a richer, more game-like experience when they're out in the world.",

        "And so, it's just been great.",
        "I will say that I don't agree with, necessarily, that purchasing going out into shopping malls is boring, but getting deal in any case is fantastic.",
        "And so that's an exciting part of it - that you're saving money, you're saving sometimes more than 50 percent off the price and, you know, and they're good products, good deals.",
        "And so, it's just fun and exciting and so that's why I do it.",

        "Yeah, exactly.",

        "So maybe you could describe who are the people who really are so enthusiastic about this.",
        "Yeah, and I think we're talking about two groups of folks here.",
        "They're folks like Michelle Harrison - the woman from North Carolina - who are using couponing(ph) techniques and trading them in order to buy things for their own use, to get things that they need, like basic staples - food and groceries.",
        "And then there are folks who are going to Groupon and other sites, who are looking a more experiential coupon experience, to buy things they might not otherwise buy.",
        "And I think that's another reason that Groupon has drawn such a high valuation and so much enthusiasm is that, even in a recession, it's found a way to get consumers to open up their pockets and to spend money in places that they otherwise wouldn't.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that whole idea of buying something that you might not otherwise buy - I mean, we just heard from a caller who, you know, obviously bought something he'd never thought of buying before.",
        "I don't know, is that a good thing, Matt?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I'm not sure it's a good thing or a bad thing.",
        "I mean, I think it kind of depends.",
        "I mean, if you're enjoying it and it's within your budget, it's probably not the worse thing.",
        "But another phenomenon that's sort of similar is stockpiling, where, you know, there's a lot of folks who they buy way more groceries than they need at the deepest discounts possible.",
        "Then take photographs of them, post them to the Internet and sort of turn their houses into these gray market warehouses.",
        "And then they take the stuff and it at flea markets or they give it to charity.",
        "But it's clearly not about the value of the item anymore, which I think has some parallels with the caller's comment.",

        "The Groupon staff had the very high-pressure sales team that goes after businesses to offer deals that don't make any financial sense whatsoever for the businesses.",
        "And you don't really realize that until you've already done your deal.",
        "And then you resell...",
        "What do you feel like was the difference between what they promised you and what you got?",
        "We're going to make a few mistakes, but all in all, we have to structure a deal that works for them, because we want repeat business, both from the merchant and from the consumer.",
        "And what are your thoughts?",
        "You like it?",
        "Well, we just got a lot of customers that were way outside of our target demographic and Groupon, they inspire you to do a deal that is well below your cost.",
        "And I see a lot of restaurants - like there was a Thai restaurant, the other day, that did a deal in San Francisco, and they sold 2,600 of these, and I was like: Oh my God, that's going to put them out of business.",
        "Why, because they wouldn't be able to handle that kind of business?",
        "They can't handle the amount of volume.",
        "You get overrun by Grouponers, and then you just can't handle it.",
        "So would you ever do this...",
        "It alienates your regular customers, and you're not making any money.",
        "You've got to hire additional staff to satisfy these Grouponers, who are also highly active on Yelp, as well.",
