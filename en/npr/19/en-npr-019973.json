        "Did you feel you got anything out of this, that you got the name of your restaurant, you got some marketing out of this?",
        "Was that a good thing?",
        "We did, yes.",
        "I mean, but what it's done is it's created this dichotomy of consumer, that instead of being a repeat-type consumer, they're just going from one deal to the next to the next.",
        "Interesting.",
        "And most small businesses are already working on very slim margins.",

        "Yeah, there have been a lot of complaints similar to Chris's, particularly from restaurants.",
        "I've never been on the receiving end of a Groupon sales call, so I can't really speak to that.",
        "I do know that they let retailers cap the number of deals that they've offered.",
        "But ultimately, if you're selling your product at a loss, then it needs to be - the idea is that the money you're losing has to come out of your advertising budget.",

        "So Groupon's pitch is that some of these customers, if your product is good, are going to stick around and turn into repeat business.",
        "The question is whether - will consumers pay full retail price, you know, having already gotten something for half-off?",
        "Or is that to cause them to, you know, see this as like a one-time thing that isn't worth the sticker price?",
        "Well, and I'm wondering how the scales are going to tip, ultimately.",
        "Is this going to be something that going to really continue to be a big thing, or if a lot of retailers start being dissatisfied, it won't work unless you've got the retailers buying into it, will it?",
        "Oh, no, not at all.",
        "It depends on Groupon being an honest and trusted broker between their users and between retailers.",
        "And I think what's going on now, is Groupon has to fine-tune their own methodologies, how they're presenting this to users and to businesses in a way that gets them in, and gets them excited about it, and gets them to sign on the dotted line, but also makes them feel like they've been treated fairly afterwards.",
