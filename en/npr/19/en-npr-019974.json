        "And I'll tell you: Of the people that bought the Groupon, I sold 145, and I've probably only had about 30 of those people come to classes so far.",
        "And of the people that came to classes, I'd say half of them either bought product from me - because I sell, like, hip scarves and things, and jewelry.",
        "They either bought products, or they bought further, you know, classes and things like that.",
        "So I can see how restaurants wouldn't do well with it, but I think any kind of service-based industry could do really well with it.",
        "But it depends on the kind of capacity that you have and what you need out of your business.",
        "I mean, you have to be smart about it.",
        "If you don't want 100 new customers to come in in the next two months, don't go on Groupon.",
        "So...",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks for your call, Linda.",
        "Sure, thank you.",
        "Maybe you can explain a little bit more to me how this works, John Bax, because you have to get enough people buying in to make it a value to those people, right?",
        "I mean, the more people that buy, the better.",
        "Is that correct?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It depends on the sort of volume that the merchant wants, which is one of the keys that you have to set up before you set that deal is to figure out how many customers that merchant really wants and how many they can handle.",
        "A lot of our larger cities, we split them into two, three, four lists.",
        "If it's a really big merchant, they'll be very popular with our customers who can handle a lot of volume.",
        "We might run them citywide.",
        "Other ones, we might run them in specific neighborhoods and not run the entire city.",
        "You know, the businesses she mentioned, businesses that have a high fixed cost and a low variable cost, it works extremely well for.",

        "So far, it's worked extremely well for them, worked well for us.",

        "And the reason I've never used LivingSocial or Groupon is that it just doesn't fit in my budget.",
        "And the thing that's really interesting, going back to one of your very first callers, is most of those people, when they woke up that morning, they didn't realize that they wanted to jump out of an airplane until we put that deal in front of them.",
        "And so it's really - in some ways, it's economic stimulus for, you know, people trying things out they never would have tried out before.",
        "Yeah, and people buying things that they never would have bought before.",
        "I mean, when I was reading about this, I thought: This is one -this is, like, a good step towards somebody who might be a hoarder.",
        "I mean, it just seems like - you could see how some people might just be buying things for the sake of buying things - which is good, I guess, for you, but, you know...",
        "Well, there's certainly a little bit of the shopping experience, too, with the 24-deal, and there's a sense of urgency about it.",

        "In Harrisonburg, we wouldn't have been exposed to LivingSocial as early as we - we certainly know about it now, but our deal ran April 30th of last year, 2010.",
        "And LivingSocial was brand new, and I don't mind confessing I'd never even heard the word Groupon.",
        "I didn't know what it was about, but I started researching it because of my interest in my loved one, and was intrigued by the opportunity that it may present.",

        "And in 2009, that meant about 645 room nights for me the entire year.",
        "In a 10-hour period on LivingSocial on Friday, April 30th, between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., 5 p.m., something like that, I sold 1,400 room nights.",
        "It was absolutely incredible and totally unexpected.",
        "And do you see customers coming back then?",
        "Well, if you think about a stay at bed and breakfast, our guests started redeeming those vouchers that they purchased from LivingSocial on April 3rd, just a few days after they bought it on the 30th of April.",
        "And most people come to a bed and breakfast about once a year.",
        "I won't experience my return guests until probably this coming April."

        "Another is that consumers are being trained here to see price as something negotiable and to see it not as like a fixed fiat quantity that they either have to take or leave, and I think that's going to be -you know, one lasting lesson of these sites is you're going to see more and more consumers utilizing their bargaining power across the counter.",
