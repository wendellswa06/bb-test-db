        "And there's a portrait that's painted that the president is somewhat incompetent.",
        "That's the view of the advisers in this book.",

        "And that's the political question.",

        "That's why you saw the biggest smile in Washington about this book was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell because he knows the president now seems to be moving more toward the mainstream of the Republican Party, at least in his alliances politically, than with Bannon.",

        "And now he's standing there at Camp David this weekend with Mitch McConnell with other leaders from the House.",
        "And it's a projection that the president and this White House, after passing a major tax bill, they, for the moment, are moving more toward the GOP, not that hard-charging Bannon style that defined them in 2017.",
        "I do feel, though, I have to ask you about the aspect of the book that has gotten a lot of attention.",

        "There have been long-simmering questions in Washington among members of both parties, but in particular Republicans, about the president's conduct - his behavior, his fitness for office.",
        "And the president had to address those simmering questions head on at Camp David because it's now not a simmer; it's a boil.",
        "But the thing that stands out in my reporting is this - so many people around the president still stay in the administration.",
