        "House Republicans have alleged the Obama administration orchestrated the delays.",

        "The disenfranchisement alleged by Issa was an IRS process that stalled scores of conservative groups in their attempts to become tax-exempt 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations.",
        "501(c)(4)s can raise unlimited contributions and shield donors from disclosure.",
        "IRS workers in a branch office had put Tea Party and other conservative groups in a category that got many months of extra scrutiny.",
