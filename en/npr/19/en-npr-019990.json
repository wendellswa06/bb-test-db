        "So when your insurance costs for flood insurance, wind insurance or even car insurance, which we've already seen responding to these types of impacts - those total costs really start to make other areas of the country look much more competitive and much more desirable.",

        "We know we're feeling the effects of climate change.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I think that conversation is becoming more and more robust, particularly in high vulnerable states.",
        "You know, even in a place like North Carolina, which, for years, has disavowed publicly - as a matter of public opinion - climate change and the impact of climate change.",
        "Well, after two years of pretty terrible storms, that public discourse is actually becoming more, you know, institutionalized and organized.",

        "And we will continue to adapt in the future.",
