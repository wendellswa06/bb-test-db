        "There are some 40,000 children in California, according to the red brief, that live with same-sex parents, and they want their parents to have full recognition and full status.",
        "The voice of those children is important in this case, don't you think?",

        "Justice Kagan asked whether, in light of that, it would be constitutional to bar marriage licenses for those over 55.",
        "For several minutes, Cooper tried to dodge the question contending that one partner in such a marriage is likely to remain fertile.",
        "Kagan wasn't letting him get away with it.",
        "I can just assure you, if both the woman and the man are over the age of 55, there are not a lot of children coming out of that marriage.",

        "He, too, was instructed to address the procedural question, does this case belong in the Supreme Court at all?",
        "He contended that the sponsors of Proposition 8 have no legal standing to appeal an adverse ruling in the lower courts.",
        "Justices Kennedy and Alito were skeptical.",
        "Here's Alito.",
        "And the whole point of the initiative process was to allow the people to circumvent public officials about whom they were suspicious.",
        "Olson finally got to make his argument that Prop 8 denies gay couples the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the Constitution.",
        "This is a measure that walls off the institution of marriage, which is not society's right.",
        "It's an individual right that this court again and again and again has said the right to get married, the right to have the relationship of marriage is a personal right.",
        "It's a part of the right of privacy, association, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.",
        "Chief Justice Roberts, however, disputed the notion that traditional marriage laws exclude same-sex couples.",
        "Rather, he maintained they're based on the historical definition of marriage.",
        "Justice Scalia hammered Olson repeatedly, demanding to know when same-sex marriage became constitutional."

        "So it's just about the label in this case?",
        "But Olson replied that the label marriage means something special.",
        "It is like you were to say you can vote, you can travel, but you may not be a citizen.",
        "There are certain labels in this country that are very, very critical.",
        "Justice Kennedy, whose vote may be critical, repeatedly seem to shy away from making such a broad constitutional ruling, though.",
        "These are uncharted waters, he observed, wondering if the court might have jumped the gun in agreeing to hear the case.",

        "Well, look, Bain invested in hundreds of companies and some of them did really, really well, became household names - Staples, The Sports Authority and so on.",
        "There are also plenty of examples of companies that failed, that went bankrupt, that outsourced jobs, that laid people off.",
