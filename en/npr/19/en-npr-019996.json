        "We'll see if it comes back and hurts him.",
        "Number two, the amount of money that Barack Obama is raising, while it is phenomenal, it is pretty much necessary for him to keep up that level straight through November because otherwise, even though John McCain is taking public financing, he's also backed up by the larger Republican National Committee, which is doing terribly well, enormously well, especially since the Sarah Palin announcement, and all those independent groups that are weighing in on the behalf of John McCain.",
