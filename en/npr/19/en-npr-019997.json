        "Thank you.",
        "Sophia, let me begin with you.",
        "Very briefly, what do you think are the keys to smart homeownership?",
        "I mean, making the most of your investment.",
        "I think being smart and making the most of your investment is to have goals, and have dreams, and knowing that you have to educate yourself after purchasing that home and knowing that you want to keep that home, and that you cannot keep up with the Joneses.",
        "So for me, I have to live within my means and set my priorities.",
        "You know Eric, the word dream is often associated with home ownership and sometimes, many times, homeowners find that their dream house turns into a nightmare if they don't handle things correctly.",
        "What is the biggest mistake new homeowners make after they get those keys?",
        "Well, you know after you've made this significant purchase, you've got the financial obligation of the house, and sometimes folks who haven't run the numbers - been analytic about looking at how much house they can really afford, find that they're being pinched and squeezed, and, and, you know, they get in the house and they have desires to make it look better.",
        "So they want to paint some rooms.",
        "They want to go out and get new furniture, and you know, more changes lead to more desires to spend money.",
        "And before you know it, people are starting to run up credit card debt or have other financial problems.",
        "So I think one of the biggest problems that I see are folks that have trouble living within their means, given the significant change that occurs in their personal finance situation when they buy a house.",
        "But they certainly do want to improve their house to make it look as good, if not better than the other houses on the street or in the neighborhood.",
        "And Sophia, I am going to come to you about this because you say that you've done about 35,000 dollars worth of repairs on your property.",
        "Now, I understand that you live in an historic home located in a changing downtown neighborhood.",
        "You redid the exterior, pulled up the floors, laid new carpet, tons of electrical work which old houses almost always have.",
        "And yet, Sophia, you did it without spending a lot of cash.",
        "How did you do that?",
        "For me, I, first, we looked within ourself, and we stayed on our path, which was important.",
        "Some of the things that we did, we collaborated with, with other people that we felt that had - that share the same dreams and goals that we have, and not wanting to get in, you know, a lot of expense.",
        "So what we did is like to ask other people that, that goes to our church that, you know okay, we're doing this project, can you help me with this?",
        "Or negotiating with someone else.",
        "And fortunately, I think NPR listeners are honest people and people wouldn't send in an answer that they hadn't gotten legitimately.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "When all Boeing 787 Dreamliners were grounded for electrical issues, it sent the stock of the company that makes the plane's batteries into a tailspin.",
        "Now that company, GS Yuasa, is seeing its stock bounce back.",
        "Yesterday, the Japanese Civil Aviation Bureau cleared the firm of all responsibility for Boeing's electrical issues.",
        "Boeing will announce its fourth-quarter earnings - by the way - later today."

        "On the back it says, chewing Trident, which contains xylitol, helps fight cavities.",
        "So do all these health claims really hold up?",
        "You know, it depends on how much of the active agent is in that product, and how much you chew per day.",
        "Francisco Ramos-Gomez is a pediatric dentist and a professor of dentistry at U.C.L.A.",
        "He says the popularity of sugar-free gums is an improvement.",

        "Since gum makers have now gone one step further - adding a natural sweetener called xylitol - there's potentially even more of a benefit.",
        "Xylitol can help kill off or starve the bacteria living on our teeth.",
        "Xylitol is an anti-microbial — so it's acting against the bacteria themselves.",

        "Peter Milgrom is a researcher and dentist at the University of Washington, Seattle.",
        "He and his colleagues have studied how much xylitol is needed to actually knock out bacteria and prevent cavities.",

        "First, glance at the ingredient list on the gum you're buying.",
        "If xylitol is the first ingredient, then there's probably enough of it to be effective.",
        "And second, chew a lot of it.",
        "You need about six grams.",
        "So the typical piece of chewing gum that's sold in the United States that has xylitol in it, has around a gram.",
        "So you have to chew, you know, say at least two pieces, three times a day, to have any effect.",
        "This may sound like an inordinate amount of chewing, but in Finland, school children have gotten used to it.",
        "Twenty-three year old Samuel Lindholm(ph), who's now living in the U.S., says when he was growing up, his parents, dentists and even teachers encouraged kids to chew xylitol gum after every meal.",

        "When you are young, it's really good to when you're teeths are still growing up and everything.",

        "Lindholm says they didn't blow bubbles, smack it around in their mouths, or make any sticky messes - at least, not that he can recall.",
        "But there's been a lot of tolerance for gum in Finnish schools ever since researchers documented the preventive effect back in the 1970s.",
        "Now, for kids who are too young to chew or don't have access to good preventive care, Peter Milgrom has just shown in a study of a group of toddlers in the Marshall Islands that a xylitol syrup is effective.",
        "This was a strawberry-flavored syrup that the kids ate without any trouble.",
        "And the mother just broke off the end of the little, squishy, plastic tube that we put it in, and squirted it on the child's teeth.",
        "The syrup reduced the development of cavities by 50 to 70 percent, depending on how much kids received.",

        "Also, you know, spend money on things that will help the maintenance and upkeep of your home - that not only make it look good but that will prevent future expenses down the road.",
        "If your, for example, if your roof needs replacing, don't continue to put that off year after year and then instead focus on cosmetic things, because if you put off the roof replacement - leaky roof can lead to other problems in the home.",

        "How important, Eric, is it to know how long you intend to stay in a house before you start spending on and for that house?",
        "Well it's, it's a good question because you know, again, you don't want to over extend yourself.",
        "You know, I generally advise that people need, ideally have at least a five-year time horizon when they buy a house.",
        "And the reason is that there are significant transaction costs involved in buying and selling a home - real estate agent commissions, title insurance, loan fees, all those sorts of things.",
        "And you know, if you look at the round trip transaction, the purchase of a home and then ultimately the sale of that same home, these transaction costs can gobble about 15 percent of the value of a house.",
        "So therefore, you know, you really need to be in a home five, maybe as long as seven years, to get enough appreciation to recoup those costs.",
        "And as we're seeing in many, but not all, many parts of the country right now, housing prices can go through periods where the prices go down as well as go up."
