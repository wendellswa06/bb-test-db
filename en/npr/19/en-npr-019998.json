        "Well Sophia, how long are you planning to stay in your house, and does that have any bearing at all on what you're willing to do to it and how much money you're willing to invest in it?",
        "Well, I do love my neighborhood that I live in.",
        "I grew up in Hertford, although I am originally from Jamaica.",
        "I do plan on staying there because right now, moving or selling our home is not a priority right now because we have a senior that's going to be going to college in September.",
        "So we will be there for a while, and we do have an eight-year-old that, we feel that, I have a commitment to my community, and I want her to be able to grow up in the Hartford community.",
        "You know, Eric, Sophia mentioned something that's really interesting and important to our conversation, and I want to address it to you because, historically, African-Americans have found it harder to buy homes, in part because of discrimination, but also because of other issues.",
        "And that's changing nowadays, in some respects, because more blacks have financial assets to pass on to their children and to help them invest in real estate.",
        "What do you recommend to someone who is inheriting wealth and wants to put that wealth in to a home?",
        "Well, you know, that certainly is an excellent use of, you know, if you're in a family where your folks, or grandparents, or someone, benevolent uncle, is willing to help you out, I can't think of a better way to use that money - to invest the money.",
        "Over the long term, real estate is a terrific investment, and that's something that I think some people you know perhaps lose site of during a period like the one we're in right now.",
        "Because if you're in an area where housing prices are going down, and, you know, they may have already gone down five, ten, fifteen percent, that's kind of depressing, you know, especially if you bought your home in the last couple of years.",
        "But it's important to remember that over your adult life, you're going to own a home for decades and over the decades, real estate is a proven winner.",
        "You know, the people who lose money are the folks that are forced into selling in a depressed market.",
        "And that sometimes happens.",
        "It's certainly happening with some of the foreclosures that are happening, but I think putting money into a home as a down payment, I think, is an excellent long-term investment.",
        "I'd like to follow that point up with you with this, and this is a little tough question I think, because housing in America is segregated generally by people who choose to segregate.",
        "And you have people who pick areas to buy homes based on a lot of factors, many of which have nothing to do with the house itself sometimes.",
        "My question is when buying a house, to what extent do you take into consideration who you're living with as opposed to how that house is likely to appreciate in value down the road, if it means taking you out of a neighborhood, or out of a community that you perhaps are comfortable with?",
        "That's right.",
        "We received over a thousand responses.",
        "And our winner this week is Geoffrey Mayne of San Diego, Calif.",
        "Congratulations.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "I have to ask, did you see the answer online when it was posted?",
        "Oh, I did not.",
        "I wouldn't have been awake at that hour."

        "Well, it's a good question, and you raise a point which sometimes people don't really think enough about or do enough research.",
        "And I think it's important in any neighborhood or community that you're contemplating living in to go spend time in those communities.",
        "You know, if it has a community center, go spend time there.",
        "Spend time walking around the neighborhoods.",
        "And sometimes people get so caught up in the process of shopping for a house that they become very house focused and not community focused.",
        "And the people that you're going to be living with, that your children will be going to school with, will have an enormous impact on your satisfaction.",
        "And you know, you should be aware of what's out there and be thoughtful about, you know, what kind of community do you want to grow up in, do you want to raise your children in.",
        "If you have children, you absolutely should go visit the schools, spend time in the schools, talk to people there.",
        "You know, and spend less time, you know, shopping among dozens of homes and more time actually in the community thinking about these issues.",
        "So for you, Sophia, in terms of being in the house now and what you are investing in it and what you will invest in it in the future, how much does the community that you have chosen to live in, play a role in how much money you are willing to put into your house?",
        "I'm not sure right now because I know that although Hertford is being developed, but at the same time, if the tax continues to go up, I'm not sure if it's something that I can probably, we can probably financially be here.",
        "But I would have to see as, you know, as the economy - the forecast of the economy, so I'm not really sure where we will be with that, to be honest with you.",
        "All right Eric, you mentioned…",
        "But I just wanted to say, I think it's important, and I appreciate the gentleman saying something about more shopping for your community instead of your house, but I know that I live in Hertford, I was raised in Hertford, and if I am, for example, I have a master's in social work, but if I leave my community and everyone that is now professional leaves their community, what are we leave with?",
        "We're left with nothing.",
        "And so, I need to be a part of that to help to build up my community.",
        "You know, one family at a time can build a community.",
        "And for me, I am committed to that.",
        "And that's why I love where I live at.",
        "Maybe, like for example, when we were looking for a home, it took about a year and a half.",
        "Some people said to me, Sophia, go to the suburb, but I know that I believe in my community, so it was okay for me to continue searching until I find the home that I wanted to live in.",
        "Right across from our home, it's a park.",
        "Down the street, there's a school.",
        "But to me, it was that I needed to be the person that was willing to build my community one family at a time.",
        "Well Eric, the things that she is mentioning, that Sophia's talking about, all have an impact on the value of a property, and you've mentioned that the current slump in housing values gives people who want an opportunity to trade-up a rare chance to do so.",
        "Trading-up - let's tell the audience exactly what that means, and why this is an opportunity right now.",
        "Well, you know, there's many potential buyers out there.",
        "There are the first time buyers and, and there's people who already own a home who you know, for example, maybe their first property they bought was quite small.",
        "Maybe they bought it when they didn't have any kids, and now they have a growing family.",
        "It's more important to them, for example, to live in a community that has a certain type of school system.",
        "So, you know, trading-up simply means that you're, you're in a financial situation where you could spend more money on a house, either in a community that has better schools or a larger home.",
        "The trade-up market in many areas is more depressed than is the entry level mark, so for folks that are in the position - and look, a lot of people are, but for the people who are in a position financially to be able to afford to spend more money on a home, the depressed market provides an opportunity.",
        "And I think it also provides an opportunity for people who are renting, who are looking for an entry point, because not only have home prices gone down but so have interest rates.",
        "And those two things together are leading to pretty significant reductions in the cost of purchasing a home."

        "Would you be in favor of home equity lines of credit for homeowners?",
        "Well, you know, once, once you're in a home and you have a mortgage on the property, you know, the question comes back to you, what can you afford?",
        "And you really have to look at your monthly spending, your monthly budget, you know, your future goals, whether it's saving for retirement or helping to pay for a portion of your kids college costs.",
        "And ask yourself, you know, can you afford to take out more debt on your house?",
        "Some people, of course, have gotten into trouble doing that over time and used up the equity in their homes and ended up with too much debt.",
        "And in the worse cases, they've ended up with their homes in foreclosure.",
        "I'm going to bring the conversation to a close with you, Sophia, around this.",
        "In the introduction, I said you had been in your home about five years.",
        "And I said, presumably, you still like it.",
        "Do you?",
        "I still love our house.",

        "And is it a better feeling for you?",

        "It is such a better feeling because living in Hertford, the area where I lived at, it was - we didn't have a backyard for our daughters to play in.",
        "And now that they're - that we have our own home, they can be able to play.",
        "They can ride their bike in the yard.",
        "They can see the beautiful landscape that we have really created and developed on our property, so it feels really great.",
        "But I think one of the things that I really want to say is that for me, it feels good, but it also feels even greater for me to be disciplined and to continue in educating myself and ourself to making sure that we keep the home.",
        "Continuing education, for example, I attend the...",
        "I'm sorry, I've got to - I'm sorry to end you there, but our time has just run out.",
