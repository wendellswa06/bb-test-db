        "Well, I was still dancing classical ballet at the time, in 1993, and I received a call from the choreographer at the time, looking for an acrobatic person with dance capabilities as well.",
        "And I've been with them almost 18 and a half years now.",
        "So you didn't have a desire, as a little boy, to run off and join the circus; you got into it a different way.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I wanted to dance for sure, but I substituted that with sports.",
        "And I had no idea what Cirque du Soleil was.",
        "And of course when I was hired I went there and saw all the people from around the world, and I was just blown away.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You are one of the only Americans in the cast; at least, in the cast in Washington.",
        "Is that difficult or fun or - ?",
        "Oh, it's fun.",
        "I mean, we have 54 artists representing 18 countries.",
        "So we just about include everyone and it's definitely a big melting pot.",
        "Have you been in other shows, other Cirque shows?",
        "Yes.",
        "I was in \"\"Mystere\"\" for five years as an original member, as an acrobat and a dancer.",
        "And so you've pretty much always been sort of an acrobat and a dancer.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "I'm also a classical pianist as well, so.",
        "Well, let's also take some calls from our listeners.",

        "I noticed that there was a lot of that in the performance I saw last night.",
        "Were you called up on the stage?",
        "Oh, no. No. No. But I'm honestly floored at how they make people think that some people are audience members and they're interacting and they're really not.",
        "That always throws me for a loop.",
        "All right.",
        "You've got the average Joe sitting there and they bring him out and it turns out that he's an actor.",

        "The reactions could be different.",
        "For instance, in Japan they won't applaud but they love it.",

        "I still fly through the air.",
        "I was an acrobat, contortionist, ball walker, Japanese Taiko drums player for five years, a competitive gymnast and dancer before that.",

        "Well, the great thing about Cirque du Soleil, if you're willing to learn something they will teach you that.",

        "Yeah.",
