        "Yes.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Mostly for me.",
        "And what keeps the show alive is because we have this extraordinary collaboration with the performers and I will actually try to trigger this moment where one day I may be talking about technical things and then we'll talk about something more artistic and I will try to actually go backstage and ask for these things to be developed while performing and while respecting the content, of course.",
        "So I'm looking at different things every night so my experience for sure is different.",
        "I'm sure the dancers – excuse me, the performers' experience is different as well.",
        "And the audience member at the end of the day might not look at something also, so.",
        "So it's not just different nights performers are maybe a little bit more on than other nights, but I mean there are actual changes in the show?",
        "We try to deliver the same high quality show every night but we, you know, they're human beings.",

        "All of them want to go onstage but sometime I may have to actually pull a performer in and put a backup act because of a condition, a physical condition, or something else.",
        "One of the really fun acts at the beginning of the show is the German wheel.",
        "It looks like a...",

        "...kind of a giant hamster wheel almost.",
        "And there's an acrobat twirling and doing almost like break dancing.",

        "The performers are highly trained.",
        "They're highly qualified for what they do and of course we will not put a performer on stage (unintelligible).",
        "So what we do is that during the training session, during the formation, there's expert in all level to supervise the process and everything is really, really taking under the microscope.",
        "So when you see a final product on stage it's because everything has been thought and well thought and processed.",
        "So we will not take risks.",
        "And these performers also don't have a chance for a mistake.",
        "So this is when I go back to my idea of the communication.",
