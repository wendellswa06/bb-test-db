        "A sensibility is what I was looking for.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "There's a certain sensibility to these shows in terms of what the costumes are and the acts and also the music is pretty distinct.",
        "And let me take a call here from Lisa(ph) in Milwaukee.",
        "Lisa, you're a fan of the music at Cirque du Soleil.",
        "Yes.",
        "I saw \"\"Quidam\"\" here in Milwaukee just recently but my first experience was 16 years ago seeing \"\"Alegria.\"\" And I was enthralled by the band and the music and I've seen as many performances as I can, not just for the visuals, but because the music is so beautiful and it's so moving.",
        "Fabrice, is the music all composed, originally, for the productions?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Actually everything was created together.",
        "And going back to the music is that - what I love about Benoit Jutras' composition is that it's really like him.",
        "He has - he is influenced by classical, by rock, by everything.",
        "And he put all of this together.",
        "And he had such a very strong sensibility and strong relationship and collaboration with Franco Dragone, when they created it together, then you can feel today again.",
        "I also believe - and I am just talking, you know, again, on the top of my head, but looking at archive and notes from Franco that to keep a short life of 15 years is that it's because you allow your performers or your musicians to bring something to the plate.",
        "So it's not an archive.",
        "It's not an old - like an old piece, one you put in a museum.",
        "The show stays alive because it get influenced by generation who get involved within the show.",
        "It can be musicians.",
        "It can be the performers, the directors and so long.",

        "My wife and I go all the time.",
        "And I'm a musician.",
        "And my question is about the music because that's one of the major attractions for it.",
        "How much do the musicians or does the band have to improvise, you know, go along with the performances?",
        "And I've also always wondered, do they play with the quick track (unintelligible) rolled into the song too quickly, you know, it could be disastrous.",
        "And those are good questions.",
        "Fabrice, how about that?",

        "Oh, All right.",
        "I have an answer to that, too, but I'm going to let Mark.",
        "Yes.",
        "As you know, all the shows are live and the music is done specifically for that act.",
        "But, of course, things can happen, so depending on the song, we have a band leader for every single show.",
        "And sometimes, there's a clique, and these are professional musicians, and they're able to improvise and be ready to change on a dime.",
        "Like all of the shows, we had 21 shows altogether, and all distinctive music, all distinctive artists.",
        "And that's what makes it work because everyone is so in tune and ready for anything to happen to make the show work.",
        "And, Mark, I'm just wondering, as the sort of the ringmaster in this performance, does it come to you to - do you hade any - do you set the pace at all for the show?",
        "Many times I can, because if something happens, I'm usually the first one on stage to try to pick something up or to keep things going.",
        "So we definitely have to be ready to move and be aware of what's happening on around us, not just what you're doing but what's happening on the entire stage.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Let's go now to Cathy(ph) in St. Paul.",
        "You've been the Cirque performance of \"\"LOVE,\"\" is it?",
        "Yeah, \"\"The Beatles in Love(ph)\"\" out in Las Vegas.",
        "I loved it.",
        "You know, I wasn't a huge Cirque du Soleil fan because I would see them on TV - and quite honestly, what I saw on TV they're just - their magic, what they do, it just, you know, it's so much better live.",
        "It's just incredible.",
        "And \"\"The Beatles in Love\"\" is the best show I've ever seen of any show of any kind - rock music, whatever.",
        "It was incredible.",
        "I just wanted to encourage your listeners: If you love Beatle music, go and see \"\"The Beatles in Love.",
        "All right.",
        "Cathy, thanks very much.",
        "Now, I understand not only The Beatles, but there's also now a performance show featuring the music of Michael Jackson."

        "Correct.",
        "And what I'm wondering, something like this, do you start with a, you know - as the artistic director, perhaps you're dealing with the show \"\"Quidam\"\" that is well established.",
        "But when it comes to developing a new show, do the creators start with a kind of a blank piece of paper or do they have some ideas, acts they'd want to work in?",
        "How does that work?",
        "They do.",
        "And I think what you have is that you have a vision of one person.",
        "And you bring to the table that vision, and you share this vision with other creator - lighting, costume, set designers and so long.",
        "It's very important during this process that all of them can really sink in and first have a listen to each other and work closely so nothing crashes.",
        "I think the harmony in \"\"Quidam\"\" is very much of a result of that.",
        "You can see 15 years later, I mean, that collaboration was so strong from the start that the product, the final product is very rich and just beautiful.",
        "The idea sometimes are very simple, and sometimes actually a creator will not know what is going to have a completion, he discovered within the process.",
        "So you just have a - maybe just a simple plot and then move with it.",
        "And then a lot of times, what happens is that it that actually you change direction.",
        "OK.",
        "This is not where I want to go.",
        "Let's meet - brief it again this way and best explore this again, and we take a different road.",
        "That happens too, but you got to have an idea to start with something.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And in constructing the show, there are - it seems different levels almost.",
        "There's the - there's a level where - Mark, you perform on the ring itself.",
        "There's often a level that's one level up with acrobats twirling and tosses, and then there's the high-wire folks as it...",
        "Aerial.",
        "Aerial, yeah.",
        "Yeah, that sort of thing.",
        "And is that how the - yeah, I mean, do you construct these shows with that sort of structure in mind?",
        "I think it's important to have this idea in mind.",
        "I mean, this is what Cirque is well known for.",
        "So you want to really explore every single aspect and every single places within your space that you're given.",
        "And, Mark, just - finally, I'm wondering what you would like to do next?",
        "Do you like being the ringmaster playing John.",
