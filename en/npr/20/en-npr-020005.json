        "And what have been some of the recent ups and downs?",
        "Oh.",
        "I think independent publishing has grown tremendously in the last ten years.",
        "As has regular mainstream publishing, I think we have seen an explosion in both.",
        "And I remember, you know, we've worked with Tina McElroy since her first book came out.",
        "We've worked to have Wade Hudson's books for 20 of the years we've been in business, too.",
        "But you see now a huge leap in the publishing industry towards, I think, non-fiction, but also urban fiction has become a huge part of the African-American selling landscape.",
        "When you think about who treats you the best - and please be honest here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "When you talk about the margins on the books, when you talk about return rates, when you talk about author appearances, what publishers treat you the best?",
        "James?",
        "Oh, I - the biggest one, of course, is Random House.",
        "And they have been great partners with us since about 1990, when we started a direct account with them.",
        "Their discounts are pretty much the same for all bookstores - the chains and the independents.",
        "Even though the chains can get a higher discount by having a warehouse where they have books shipped to centrally, but Random House, Harper Collins, all of the big publishers have given us authors over the years.",
        "It's a competitive field now.",
        "Everybody wants - as Barack Obama, who we had last year, said everybody wanted him this - last year for his book, but 10 years ago, Eso Won Books wanted him for \"\"Dreams from My Father.\"\" So it's very competitive marketplace, though.",
        "When you talk about things like how easily it is that you communicate about returns, about just the financial issues.",

        "Oh, definitely.",
        "I just was telling someone yesterday - an independent publisher called, and she was very upset that we wouldn't take her book because it's not available from a distributor.",
        "But when you have thousands of books, you just can't deal with individuals unless it's someone like a Tina McElroy.",
        "I would, you know, would definitely carry her book even if we have to get it directly from her...",
        "Thank you very much, James.",

        "I appreciate that.",

        "But a lot of times, we want to support authors, and you can now.",
        "I mean, publishing has changed where this print-on-demand technology has made it where you can look up on Ingram, which is a book distributing company.",
        "You can look up on their database and order these books that are print on demand.",
        "You can carry them, but the risk is you can't return them.",
        "But, you know, there are a lot of titles that are going to sell, and they're going to sell through.",
        "And sometimes you order instead of 10, you order 3 and try to sell through.",
        "But a lot of the smaller publishers just do not realize that you can't deal with them independently.",
        "Wade, we've always gone through Africa World Press and Africa World Books out of Baltimore to get his books.",
        "But sometimes even directly through him.",
        "Tina and then...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...Wade, how hard is the business side?",

        "Well, I guess it does a little bit of both.",
        "I was just going to speak to what James was saying.",
        "One of the things about independent publishers, truly is, I know that there are many challenges that James just spoke to.",
        "But the other thing I think that there is an excitement about this because we do see that there is such a huge market out there.",
        "And there's such a huge hunger for our books.",
        "And that - other thing is that I think many authors know a good deal about publishing.",
        "I can just speak for myself.",
        "I think that you have to be a smart and savvy author now.",
        "You know, many authors do a great deal of their publicity even when they're a bit with a large publishing company.",
        "You know, there are -many authors have outside editors even if they're with a big publishing company.",
        "So I think that many authors are very savvy, those who have gone into publishing.",
        "And I hope that, you know, my step into publishing urges other folks to at least look all alternatives because I think there are all kinds of ways to do things and went through the turnstile at a time just because there's a huge market for urban fiction or urban lit right now, doesn't mean that, you know, you should take such a huge bite out of the literary landscape for African American writers.",
        "But, Wade...",
        "And, of course...",
        "Let me ask Wade a very specific question.",
        "How do you deal with submissions?",
        "You know, there's the business and the trying to get things out, but what about the business end of taking things in?",
        "Can people just send you a manuscript and say, this is what I want to get published.",
        "Do you want it?",
        "How does that work?",
        "Well, when we first started we were very open to receive manuscripts in the mail, authors will call us and we would say, yeah, send the manuscript.",
        "But we get tons and tons of manuscripts now from writers, so we really cannot review all of the manuscripts that we get.",
        "So, what we do is, we let agents and authors know what time of the year that we are reviewing manuscripts.",
        "We publish from eight to 10 titles a year and that's what we can manage.",
        "So, we don't really take on more than what we really can handle.",
        "But I want to speak to bookstore sales and - for us, you know, we recognize early on that we could not really depend solely on bookstore sales to grow our company.",
        "So what we did was looked at ways that we can actually get our books to where people were.",
        "So, we set up book fairs and we hooked up with sororities and churches where we actually took our books to the people.",
        "And that is the way we have sort of grown our company.",
        "And also, the educational market - the school market is enormously great for us as well.",
        "So, bookstore sales certainly are important, but they are just part of what we do in terms of getting our books to the marketplace.",
        "And, James...",
        "Farai, I'm sorry, can I just say quickly..."

        "Sure.",
        "...I think that that's one of the things that independent and small publishers can do that larger publishers don't seem to take advantage of.",
        "It's just what Wade just said, and that's taking advantage of private findings and sororities.",
        "And I went to Spelman College, taking advantage of all this - every year - graduating a whole, you know, a whole - another generation of readers and going to those places, and not just going to the established bookstores, in places that, you know, that traditionally we've gone to.",
        "And I think that smaller publishers can sort of turn on the dime, and if they see a trend, they can sort of jump on it without having to turn the whole machinery around.",
        "Exactly.",
