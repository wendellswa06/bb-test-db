        "It's time for us as Americans to have an adult conversation with each other about the serious challenges that face our country.",
        "That's John Boehner again.",
        "If you flip through the Pledge to America, you'll find idyllic photographs of the American countryside, the great national parks and monuments like the Statue of Liberty and Mount Rushmore.",
        "But what the Pledge to America doesn't say is that if all of its provisions were to be enacted, then by the year 2020, according to economist Howard Gleckman, the federal government would have no money to maintain any of those beautiful places.",
        "They'd be closed.",
        "Maybe we could sell them to Hilton or something.",
        "But essentially, they would be closed.",
        "Howard Gleckman is with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.",
        "He's looked at the Republican plan, and he says if you make the Bush tax cuts permanent and you don't cut Medicare, Social Security or defense, then by the year 2020...",
        "Well, there would be no more money for highways.",
        "There'd be no more money for mass transit.",
        "There'd be no funds for the national parks.",
        "There'd be no subsidies for small businesses.",
        "We talked a lot about how important small business is - well, the Small Business Administration, and the assistance that it gives to small businesses, would go away.",
        "We complain that there's not enough food safety.",
        "Well, there would be no food safety in this kind of an environment.",
        "There'd be no National Institutes of Health to do research in cancer and other diseases.",
        "The government, as we know it, would simply disappear.",
        "Which may not be such a bad thing for a certain segment of the American public, but that's not necessarily what the Republican plan promises to do.",
        "President Reagan is quoted in that manifesto, and many Republican leaders argue that this plan is based on his economic principles.",
        "So we called up the architect of Reaganomics, David Stockman, who was Reagan's budget director, to find out what he thinks about it.",
        "When I look at the Republican plan, I have to say I think it's half right on some things, and it's half-baked on a lot of others.",
        "It is right in at least addressing the out-of-control spending problem.",
        "And it is true that non-defense discretionary spending has soared not only since Obama came in, but even as bad during the Bush administration; it rose 60 percent."

        "The problem is the deficit is 1.5 trillion and growing, and what they're proposing on non-defense spending will save 100 billion if we're lucky.",
        "And I doubt that they would actually accomplish that if they were in charge.",
        "So when you try to solve the problem by filling 7 percent of the hole, I don't think you've gotten very far.",
        "And in the process, you're telling the people of America that we can solve this issue - which is very dangerous, the deficit that we're facing and the debt we're building up - by not raising taxes on anyone.",
        "That, in my judgment, is a big lie.",
        "Now, as you mentioned, the Republican plan talks about cutting discretionary spending - nothing too specific, but presumably things like education and infrastructure spending.",
        "No talk about cutting mandatory spending, things like Medicare and Social Security.",
        "Can you begin, you know, to tackle exploding deficits without beginning to take a hard look at those programs?",
        "No, I don't think you can.",
        "And that's why I think, as I said, the plan's half right but also half-baked.",
        "They're being disingenuous when they say right in the second or third page, I see here, that we will exempt seniors -that's all of Social Security and Medicare, I presume, and federal retirement and so forth - that will exempt veterans; will exempt all of defense, Homeland Security.",
        "And you have to pay the interest on the debt.",
        "Well, that happens to add up to 2.4 trillion - or almost two-thirds of the budget.",
        "So if you're exempting two-thirds of the budget, and you're focusing only on non-defense discretionary, which actually is only about 500 billion - or 15 percent of the budget - it's pretty obvious you can't get the job done.",
        "And when you're talking only about freezing non-defense discretionary - again, maybe you save a hundred, or rolling it back to 2-0-8 - maybe you save 100 billion.",
        "But how does that really answer the challenge and the threat of a 1.5 trillion hole in the budget?",
        "So therefore, the plan just doesn't measure up.",
        "David Stockman, let me ask you about the idea of making the Bush tax cuts permanent.",
        "Some economic analysts have said that if you do that, that by the year 2020, the government wouldn't have enough money to spend on anything except for Medicare, Social Security and defense - if it's lucky.",
        "Do you think that sounds about right?",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "We couldn't afford the Bush tax cuts when they were put in, in 2-0-1, 2-0-3.",
        "Now, we're - eight years later, we're trillions in additional debt later, we're two unfinanced wars later, we're a trillion dollars of stimulus spending later, 800 billion of TARP.",
        "So it's pretty obvious if we couldn't afford them back then, in no way, shape or form can we even dream about affording them now.",
        "Do you think President Obama is being honest with the voters?",
        "No, I don't think he is at all.",
        "I think when he said no taxes on the middle-class or on anyone below 250,000, he was being totally disingenuous.",
        "That's most of the people in the country.",
        "Sure, there..."

        "Here we are today with a deficit that's 10 percent of GDP, and it doesn't look like there's any prospect that it's going to decline at anytime soon - or any willingness to even acknowledge the problem and address it.",
        "The idea that the economy is weak and so we have to wait two or three years, is just an excuse.",
        "The economy is weak because of our irresponsible fiscal and monetary policies over the last 10, 20 or even 30 years.",
        "And it's going to keep getting weaker unless we face up to the problem.",
        "So, yes, it's the chicken and egg.",

        "For 25 years, Toyota ran a unique joint venture with General Motors called New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., or NUMMI for short.",
        "That partnership ended when GM went bankrupt.",

        "The news came from Toyota's President Akio Toyoda, who promised to invest $50 million in Tesla.",
        "The fledgling electric carmaker will, in turn, buy the old NUMMI plant, a facility where Toyoda himself had once worked.",
        "I'm extremely happy that the DNA of car-making that the NUMMI team developed over 25 years of production there will live on in an industry for the future.",
        "The impetus for the partnership came about six weeks ago when Toyoda visited Tesla CEO Elon Musk at his home in Southern California.",
        "The two men hit it off, especially after they went for a test drive in a two-seat Tesla Roadster with Toyoda at the wheel."

        "The Republican campaign spokesman for Congress - spokeswoman, I should say - immediately came out and said one election in one state does not prove a trend.",
        "But let's consider that we now have polls showing a strong favoring of Democrats in the congressional elections coming this November; we have, to some degree, a conflict between the Republican nominee for president, John McCain, and his Republican House colleagues over earmarking and a number of other issues; and then on top of that, their long-time speaker, in fact served longer as speaker than any Republican in history, Dennis Hastert, has stepped down and retired and had the unfortunate coda put to his career of having his district fall to the Democrats, a district that had been Republican forever.",
        "So there is an inescapable sense of an era coming to an end, particularly given some of these other factors, and you know, the Republicans' diminished prospects for this fall.",
        "Well, speaking of those diminished prospects, it seems that a lot of them could be due to retirement.",
        "Some 28 Republicans have announced their retirements.",
        "That's right, about three-fourths of all the retirements on the House side, and even more meaningfully, of the dozen races that look closest around the country for this November, among the House members more than half of them are districts where a Republican is retiring in a situation where the Democrats have a shot.",
        "So this give the Democrats a good chance of making the House of Representatives substantially more Democratic in November.",

        "Yes, he is.",
        "This is the state with probably more African-American voters in the primary than any other, more even than South Carolina, and if he continues to dominate in that vote, he should easily win in Mississippi.",
        "Over the weekend, he won easily in Wyoming, a totally different demographic situation, but a caucus, and Barack Obama has been dominating in the caucus states."
