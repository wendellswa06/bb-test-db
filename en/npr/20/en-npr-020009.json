        "So in Mississippi we expect to see him pick up maybe six or seven net delegates, maybe even 10 net delegates, that being more delegates for him than for Hillary, and that would eliminate, mathematically, the delegate gains that she made last Tuesday by winning primaries in Ohio, Rhode Island and Texas.",
        "She has moved on to Pennsylvania, where there are a lot more delegates at stake.",
        "That's right, and that's one where really about all Obama can hope to do is to make it close.",
        "If he can make it close, he could have the effect that we saw in Texas and Ohio, where even though Hillary Clinton won, her payoff in delegates was minimal, and if he can minimize her payoff in delegates in Pennsylvania and then move on to a few other states where he would do better before the end of the primary season, he can assure himself of a substantial lead, more than 100 pledged delegates at the end of the primary process.",
        "Ron, as the campaign is heating up between the Democratic candidates, how dangerous could it be for the eventual nominee in terms of the general election?",
        "Dangerous indeed.",
        "In the case of Hillary Clinton, if she sees it as necessary to tear down Barack Obama between now and Pennsylvania or between now and the end of the primary process, if she sees that as her only way to the nomination, she may get to the point where she can't really turn around and offer him the vice presidency, having said he was not qualified to be president and all of the rest of it.",
        "If she can't offer him the vice presidency, it's very difficult to see how she heals the wounds in the parties that would have been created, and if she can't bring back the African-American voters and the younger voters that identify particularly strongly with Obama in November, it's very hard to see how she wins the electoral college or wins a majority of the popular vote in November.",
        "So there's a big risk factor in how negative she chooses to get.",
        "As for Barack Obama, he has a big risk factor too, because if he becomes negative at all in any substantial degree, he undercuts the essence of his own new politics and change-the-way-of-life-in-Washington message.",

        "I won't run through all of the cities - we'll talk about them - but why did these cities make it to the top 10?",
        "What were they judged on?",
        "Well, there's a lot of factors, actually.",
        "We started off by looking at our readers themselves, because they live in the cities.",
        "That's one thing for the editors to go and spend a day or two in the cities.",
        "But if you live there, you have a better sense of what the quality of life is in those particular cities.",
        "So we left it up to our readers and had a online survey in which they filled out what they felt was their favorite city and why.",
        "And that gave us our starting universe, because, as you know, there's lots and lots of cities and we needed to narrow the playing field a little bit.",
        "And when we came up with those lists - those cities, rather - there were a couple of dozen of them, and then we ran it through a program that we had developed specifically for this that looked at 28 different factors.",
        "And we can go into those factors later.",
        "And once we ran that program, the list you see is the list that the program came up with.",
        "So you did this survey in 2004 as well.",
        "Mm-hmm."

        "So can you put that into context for us?",

        "Well, because here in the district, we have not seen the excessive opioid prescribing and the conversion from misuse of opioid prescriptions to heroin on the street, which is the modality of addiction that has been described in other places.",
        "So...",

        "Sure.",
        "We have been focusing, some people would say, too much on that population.",
        "So I think that - you know, the way that I've described it is what's happening here is probably what's happening around the country in smaller pockets.",
        "But because 80 percent of the deaths have been the young, white population, everybody else is focusing on their 80 percent.",
        "Well, our 80 percent here in the district is the older African-American male.",
        "So I think when the rest of the country gets around to looking at that 20 percent that they're going to find a lot of different, diverse populations in there."

        "So it occurred to me - since I'm a professor at a very large school of music, and we have wonderfully talented musicians and conductors here - whether it might be possible to make a recording for the archive and to have a performance - so, in other words, to give a voice to this manuscript.",
