        "Yeah, I was very, very surprised living - being a resident of both.",
        "I mean, I'm here in Nashville.",
        "And one of the things that comes out often in conversations across the board - and by that I mean at networking sessions with young black professionals, in the barbershop, on the corner, sitting at a social event or a cultural activity - is when the article comes up and people talk about Nashville was named as one of the top cities for African-Americans, it usually elicits a little bit of laughter because they would say, wow, I wonder how much time the people who were interviewed spent in Nashville.",
        "Nashville does have a lot of good things going for it in terms of potential, and I think that a reader of Black Enterprise would also be a person who would probably fall into that category of a young professional, somebody who probably moved here to work for one of the corporations that has become headquartered here, whether it's Dell or Nissan, one of the other banks that are here.",
        "And there is a lot of good potential here because the cost of living is reasonable and we have activities from the Titans to the Predators.",
        "I don't know if we're really hockey fans yet, if we've really bought into that fully.",
        "But I think that sometimes surveys are filled out on the potential that people see here.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, keep in mind that the survey…",
        "Yes.",

        "Right.",
        "Or factors.",
        "Right.",
        "So what were the quality of life issues, Alan?",

        "Black mortgage rejection percentages.",
        "Obviously, you want a low percentage of rejections.",

        "As I said, there were 20 different factors that we thought were very important to the African-American community, and we gave those factors a higher weighting than - I know public transportation was just something we looked at.",
        "But for our audience we thought black graduation rates was a little bit more important than that.",
        "So we didn't give them the equal weighting.",
        "So the things that pertain specifically to the black community had a higher weighting on the list than things like, you know, how well the roads are.",
        "Jeff, two-thirds of the cities in the study fell below the Mason-Dixon line, so two-thirds of the winners, the people in the top 10, cities in the top 10, rather.",
        "So give us an example of why you think that is by telling us something about Nashville that you love.",
        "Well, I think what I really love about Nashville is the fact that we are starting to get the infrastructure in place that a larger city would have.",
        "We don't the have great public transportation that I missed having in New York, or what you're having in the Chicago or D.C., or even in Atlanta.",
        "We don't have that.",
        "It's coming into place now.",
        "They're starting to get rail transit.",
        "They're working on building a new public transportation system.",
        "And everybody is coming into inner city ring, so to speak.",
        "But that's giving us infrastructure of a big city, but they're still enough of a small-town feel for you to be comfortable in knowing your neighbors.",
        "And I think that's what attractive for people below the Mason-Dixon line, to not be in a place where things are so fast, but not to be in a place where they're so slow that you feel like you kind of kick back and put a piece of hay in your mouth, too.",
        "So I think that's what attractive."

        "Ten years ago, less than one percent of the city contracts went to minority vendors, including African-Americans, and we're 27 percent of the population here.",
        "So they commissioned a study that was a disparity study, spending half a million dollars and another 10 years.",
        "And 10 years later, we're still less than one percent of those contracts.",
