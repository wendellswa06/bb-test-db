        "Okay, so your immune can do a lot of different things but one of those things is make antibodies.",
        "And what we know is while we've got about 25 different human vaccines, okay, and about 23 of them work by protective antibody.",
        "What are protective antibodies?",
        "Well, so, you know, your immune system's job is to protect you from infectious diseases and so, what antibodies will do is that if you get infected with say, the flu, your body makes antibodies that will bind to those flu viruses.",
        "And effectively by just binding to the virus and just completely covering it with an antibody it kills the virus…",
        "Hmm.",

        "So then, what do you need those helper T-cells to do?",

        "And so, what's been known is that there are like four different kinds of helper T-cells, okay, or four flavors of helper T-cells.",
        "And each of these are - they're specialized for different functions.",
        "So, these helper T-cells, they're very powerful regulators of the immune system.",
        "Your immune system can do many different things and each of these four types of helper T-cells are, sort of, specialized for controlling different parts.",
        "And the problem was none of these four known types of helper T-cells, these four flavors, none of those who are specialized for helping get antibody responses.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Or there was a fifth type and we were missing something.",

        "With a much fighting back and forth about, you know, what might be right and, you know, I - so, a Nobel prize winner once said, you know, that there are two kinds of scientists, there are lumpers and there are dividers.",
        "So the lumpers try and come up with a theory of everything, like connect everything together, and dividers try and break everything down and figure out, well, what's specialized to exactly do what.",
        "And so, there was a lot of that argument going on and so we said, well, look if there really is this fifth kind, then there should be a gene, a single gene that turns on that type of CD4.",
        "And we've said that because, well, that's the way it was to the other four types.",
        "So we know there are these other four types, and one of these really fascinating things about the immune system is that for each of those other four types, there's a master gene, a master regulator gene, is what we call them."
