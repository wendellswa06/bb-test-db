        "So you're looking for that gene for the fifth time.",
        "Right.",
        "And you found it.",
        "And so that's what we found.",
        "You found it.",
        "And that - how did you know that that's, how do you know that you found it?",
        "Do you turn it on and watch it make the parts that you need?",
        "Exactly.",
        "You know, that's why you do experiments.",
        "We, in fact, had multiple guesses for what might be the gene but we had to do experiments to figure out which one was the right one and we knew when we found the right one, because if we turn on that gene, now all of a sudden - all of those helper cells becomes that fifth type, that kind that helps you get a good antibody response.",
        "And so now if we did that in the animal often we got a great antibody response and all the helper cells were of this one kind.",
        "And so that was sort of the on switch, like that gene was the on switch for this specialized cell type.",
        "And what happens is, is you turn on that one gene and then that one gene basically controls a program, okay.",
        "And so it will basically, you turn that one gene and then it will go and activate all of the specialized functions that cell has to do.",
        "Right, every good side also has a bad side.",
        "I mean…",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "Right.",

        "So, that's one of the things we really got quite excited about in the work was that basically we also found effectively the opposite gene.",
        "There's a gene that could turn the whole thing off and then we found a gene that could turn this specific type of cell off, and what was really nice about that was by studying that process we could actually show that this was important, that this fifth type, it didn't just happen to be in the right place at the right time.",
        "You really have to have that type to get a good antibody response because if we turn, if we flip this off switch, if we, you know, if we forcibly turn on this off switch gene, or in fact what we just did was we just added that gene so that it was just on…",
        "I got you.",
        "There you go.",
        "…that gene was present all the time.",
        "So, then you had this off switch.",
        "Now, you no longer got these helper cells and you no longer got an antibody response.",
        "And so when we, for example, gave a mouse a virus infection, now they no longer made antibodies to the virus.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And so, by doing so we could show, okay, you absolutely have to have this kind of cell.",
        "And so, therefore that - the gene that turned, you know, the gene you have to turn on to get those cells now we know that that's important for the kind of vaccine design we do.",
        "Well, now that you have the gene, you know which one to turn it on, can you make more powerful vaccines?",
        "We think so.",
        "I mean so, you know, what I would say is that, you know, it took us four years to do these experiments and the immune system certainly a very complex network.",
        "So it will certainly take that long or longer, you know, to make a medical application.",
        "But we really do - we're quite convinced that this is a central thing we needed to know along the path.",
        "You know, if we're going to switch from the situation where we've been, you know, truly trial and error vaccine design to something that's a more rational vaccine design and more sort of an engineering…",

        "Yeah.",

        "And frankly, sometimes it gets confused and the immune system attacks your body and that's an autoimmune disease.",
        "And so, in that case, your immune system is making antibodies - instead of making antibodies against the flu, right, your body is making antibodies against itself and causing damage.",
        "And so - and that's the kind of case where you get rheumatoid arthritis or certain other autoimmune diseases.",
        "And so in those cases, you want to be able to turn the immune system off.",
