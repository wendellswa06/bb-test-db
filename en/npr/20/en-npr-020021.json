        "And if they don't, will kids growing up then know what the heck their granddads were talking about when they talked about hit the reset button?",

        "Sure.",
        "Well, at least it was TV.",
        "You know, some of us go back into the radio era.",
        "And, you know, one of the most interesting things for me in writing \"\"I Love It When You Talk Retro\"\" was finding out the origins of a lot of catchphrases that we use.",
        "For example, gangbusters, you know, going like gangbusters.",
        "Coming on like gangbusters.",
        "Coming on like gangbusters.",
        "Well, it turns out that comes from a 1930s very popular radio show called \"\"Gangbusters.\"\" And this would open with a lot of screeching of cars, and breaking of glass, and shots being fired from Tommy Guns and sirens, and it got everybody's attention.",
        "And the show died after a few years.",
        "But the term gangbusters has been with us ever since.",

        "So, ever since then, the phrase, Nixon goes to China, has eluded to the thought that somebody who opposed a policy was in the best position to change it.",
