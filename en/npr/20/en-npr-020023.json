        "Don, did the president say anything about a benchmark, about when the right time would be to leave Iraq?",
        "No, but he has shifted his language on this a little bit over the last couple of days.",

        "will stand down.",
        "Today, the president said, my policy is stand up, stand down.",
        "And he also addressed the need to deal with Iraq's oil production.",
        "Here's what he said.",
        "I reminded the government that that oil belongs to the Iraqi people.",
        "And the government has the responsibility to be good stewards of that valuable asset and valuable resource.",
        "Don, what was the president getting at there?",
        "It's interesting.",

        "I think he, perhaps, sensed that it sounded like that, as well.",
        "Later on, he said that his position is to be an advisor to this sovereign nation and that they will make these decisions, that he will offer them advice, and that the U.S.",
