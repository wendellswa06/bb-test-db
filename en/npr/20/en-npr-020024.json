        "And so it was just, you know, basically silliness, and so walking on stage and saying I have cancer was - it was beyond anything I'd ever done before.",
        "Does the audience take time to actually understand what's going on when...",
        "Yeah, I mean, you know, I had - just the day before I had been at a doctor's appointment, being told that it was stage two with an invasive tumor.",

        "You know, nobody knew.",
        "It was so fresh, and saying I have cancer, people were laughing, thinking oh, I wonder where this is going.",

        "I want to give people a flavor of it.",
        "I guess - hearing you describe it, it's almost impossible to imagine how any of this could be funny, but I thought it was really funny.",

        "And also people aren't telling us jokes at a furious rate.",
        "The essential ingredient for laughter is another person.",
        "For example, in Tig's audience you had a group of people, and they're laughing when they hear other people laugh.",
        "So laugh is contagious.",
        "Also it was a comedy club.",
        "So they came with the expectation that they were going to get comedy, and so I've got cancer ends up being part of comedy.",

        "Well, they're both unconsciously controlled.",

        "But when we look at the laughter, such as in Tig's performance, it works because there's a kind of authenticity.",
        "Tig had the skill of getting the audience to care about her because most everyday laughter, not just comedy but most everyday laughter, is done during conversation and play with friends, family and lovers.",
        "And one of the big challenges of a comedian like Tig is getting the audience to care, developing a relationship with the audience.",
        "It's not just a matter of going out and subjecting the audience to jokes.",
        "Her personality makes all this work, not her material.",
        "That's interesting.",
        "Do you find that to be true, Tig?",
        "It depends on the city and the night, but yeah, probably.",
        "I mean, I've heard that comedians, usually people want - when a comedian's on stage, you, the audience has to want to go to lunch with that person.",
