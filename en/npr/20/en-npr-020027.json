        "More than 160 people were hurt by the massive blast, which caused $100 million in damage to the surrounding neighborhoods.",
        "I went to West, both in the immediate aftermath of the explosion and then again last month to see how the recovery was coming along.",
        "West is a mostly Czech community famous for its delicious pastries called Kolaches.",
        "Travelers making the dreary 200-mile drive between Dallas and Austin often make a quick, Kolache pit-stop in West as a reward for making it that far.",
        "What we ask of jurors is not that they're blank slates, not that they've been living in a cave and haven't heard anything about this trial, but rather that they can be impartial going in, that they have an open mind, and that they'll decide based on the evidence.",
        "They don't make it easy for the jury at all.",
        "James Matsumoto was the foreman of the Blagojevich jury.",
        "After 14 days of tough deliberations, the jury only agreed on one count, and fell short of reaching a unanimous verdict on the others.",
        "Matsumoto says a plethora of charges, and complicated legal concepts behind them, left the jury confused.",
        "Your eyes just roll up into your head.",
        "You just say, oh my God, how are we going to do this?",
        "Well, what we did is, we took a little section at a time, and it took forever.",
        "And when I hear, what are they doing there for two and a half weeks?",
        "What we're doing is schooling ourselves in law.",
        "The problem, says Matsumoto, was that everyone was looking at the evidence in different ways - particularly one juror, who was the sole holdout on many of the major counts.",
        "And later on she said, you see red - not to me, but to the panel - she said, and I see green, and I cannot see red with the evidence that we're presented.",
        "She taught me what it really meant, courage of conviction.",
        "The jury foreman has some additional advice, not for the jury but for the prosecutors: Take more time to plainly explain the case."

        "I firmly believe that it is too complicated.",

        "Apparently, the holdout juror said, I wanted to see a result; I wanted to see a deal; I wanted to see more than just talk, and more than just smoke.",
        "And you know, the prosecution has to take that very seriously.",
        "That's why I suggested, you know, putting on the witnesses who definitely know what the result was.",

        "There may or may not be additional witnesses.",
        "But the tapes aren't going to go away, and I think the tapes are the most devastating to Mr. Blagojevich.",
        "There is also a co-defendant, and the government says it will retry Blagojevich's brother, Robert, as well.",
        "The jury did not reach a verdict on the four charges he still faces, though many jurors said they believed he was not guilty.",
        "What remains up in the air is who will represent Rob Blagojevich.",
        "His attorneys have not said whether they'll take on the second trial.",
        "They may be assigned to stay on the case to shorten any trial preparation, or Blagojevich may get a court-appointed attorney.",
        "Regardless, Blagojevich says there's little money left in his campaign fund, so it may be taxpayers footing the bill - although the former governor says he's willing to do another reality TV show for cash, if the opportunity arises.",

        "You have to be careful about seeing a pattern in what may be isolated incidents, but even though China has greatly reinforced security at schools across the country, a number of Chinese seem eager to blame a government that could not keep tainted infant formula off grocery shelves or explain why at least 5,000 children died when so many poorly built schools collapsed during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.",
