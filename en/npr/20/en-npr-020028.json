        "So, Mark, what exactly is going on here?",
        "What are agencies like the TSA, as we just heard, trying to accomplish by getting on all these social networking sites?",
        "Well, I think to some degree they're recognizing the fact that citizens are using all these social networking sites to have conversations with each other, and they want to be part of that conversation - actually reading what people are saying about them, reading about people's experiences, and then in some cases answering questions or following up with people that have had trouble at airports and so on.",
        "Is it worth it?",
        "I mean, are airplane passengers actually out there in large numbers using a video like this, and you know, going on reading the tweets that come out from out from the TSA?",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean people are increasingly using mobile devices to interact with government agencies.",
        "And that is happening more and more in real time, actually.",
        "And I guess there is an important distinction to make.",
        "I mean the TSA has, you know, its own YouTube channel.",
        "But agencies are also dealing with the question of whether their people can have their own pages.",
        "And if we look at the military, the Marine Corps actually announced that it's banning social networking sites; their people can't use them.",
        "But other branches, like the Army, have just given a green light to people serving in the Army.",
        "Why the different reaction?",
        "There's just no one good answer yet?",
        "When did Al Gore become hip?",
        "It's crazy.",
        "On April 17, 2013, people jumped into their cars and followed the fire engines screaming through town.",
        "As the volunteer firefighters unrolled their hoses, the West fertilizer plant blazed in the evening sun, yellow flames shooting into the sky.",
        "It occurred to almost nobody that they could be in danger, except one man.",
        "Capt.",
        "Kenneth Harris Jr. was a 31-year veteran of the Dallas Fire Department, but Harris lived in West.",
        "And that terrible day, he and a friend rushed to the fertilizer plant to help.",
        "A highly trained professional, Harris immediately understood the situation was critical.",
        "He jumped out of his truck and told his friend to drive as far and as fast as he could.",
        "Then, Harris ran toward the fire and warned the volunteers they had to get out.",
        "They'd just begun their retreat when the plant exploded.",
        "They were killed instantly and so was Captain Harris.",
        "This past Monday, a group of Texas legislators began meeting to discuss what, if any, new regulations the state might pass to prevent a similar catastrophe.",
        "Texas has one of the most conservative and regulation-adverse legislators in the country so the odds of passing expansive new laws are slim.",
        "What is politically feasible are new laws requiring better public disclosure by fertilizer and chemical plants about what exactly is going on inside their facilities.",
        "Nothing is guaranteed to pass, but it would honor the brave men of West and the heroic Capt.",
        "Harris if Texas would better inform and train their volunteer firemen so that the next time they face a situation like the West fertilizer plant, it won't be such a route.",
        "You're listening to NPR news."

        "This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News.",
        "I'm Scott Simon.",
        "The Glass Menagerie\"\" is back on Broadway.",
        "The sixth Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams' great American play opened Thursday at the Booth Theater for a limited 17-week run.",
        "John Tiffany directs the production.",
        "It stars Cherry Jones as Amanda, Zachary Quinto as Tom, Celia Keenan-Bolger as Laura, and Brian Smith as the Gentleman Caller.",
        "The cast had a tryout run in Boston last spring, and earned rave reviews.",
        "Barbara Chai of the Wall Street Journal's Speakeasy blog saw the play, toured the set, spoke with a few people in the production.",
        "She explains how John Tiffany makes this new production stand out from the rest.",
        "Well, what's interesting is in previous productions, many directors have opted for a naturalistic set.",
        "In other words, apartments with ceilings and walls, full floors.",
        "But John Tiffany, I think, really embodies Tennessee Williams's original idea of classic theater in which the truth can be represented by changing forms and with expression and not necessarily a photographic likeness.",
        "And so in John Tiffany's set, it's stripped down bare, it's minimalist and there are three hexagonal wooden platforms that represent the rooms in this apartment.",
        "And to give the idea of being in the past, he has the platforms literally floating on black liquid so that you get the idea that this family is marooned in the past.",
        "This doesn't detract from those very well-known lines at this point?",
        "I think it only adds to the lines.",
        "Certainly in the beginning, we have Tom's introduction where he says: I'm the opposite of a stage magician providing truth in a pleasant disguise of illusion.",
        "And then it's as if he's tripping backward and he takes us into his memory in the past.",
        "And as he walks into the hexagonal rooms, he's actually lit a different color.",
        "He's lit bluish-white as if he's a ghost, whereas Amanda and Laura are lit in candlelit, sort of evocative of memories.",
        "Tell me about Zachary Quinto as Tom.",
        "For years, Tom was played as Tom.",
        "And then over the years it's been permissible, maybe based less on the lines than on Tennessee Williams' own biography, to play Tom with, I think, increasingly opening the door to the idea that Tom might have been a closeted gay.",
        "How do they handle that in this production?",
        "It's a great question because it isn't ever explicitly described in the play.",
        "He just says, I go out late at night, and I'm at the movies.",
        "And Amanda, his mother, of course, when she's on his back and saying why are you going out every night?",
        "Where are you going?",
        "Why do you come stumbling home at 2 A.M. with drink on your breath?",
        "There's the implication that she knows he's up to something that she doesn't consider clean and proper.",
        "And when I spoke with the director John Tiffany, who is himself openly gay, he said that he's certain, in that part of the play, that she's referring to his sexuality.",
        "And so it's interesting because in the cast, Zachary Quinto just came out a couple of years ago.",
        "For many years, though, when he was the star of \"\"Heroes,\"\" it was never confirmed.",
        "But a couple of years ago, said on the record that there were a number of teenage suicides by young people who were grappling and struggling with their own identity and with bullying at school and he wanted to come out and say I'm a gay male and I'm an actor and I'm still the same person as I was before I made this announcement.",
        "This play stands up well over the years?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And again, with this fresh production, I think - it's like that Emily Dickinson quote: Tell the truth, but tell it slant.\"\" I think that is originally what Tennessee Williams was getting at with the idea of plastic theater; that it does not have to be a literal expression of the truth.",
        "You can come at it from an angle.",
        "And what's beautiful here is that John Tiffany, I think, takes that literally and created this abstract set with Bob Crowley.",
        "And what's also interesting to me, Scott, is that John is English, and Bob Crowley, the set designer, is Irish.",
        "And John said to me, you know, doing Tennessee Williams in America is like an American stage director doing Shakespeare in the UK.",
        "And this season there we have Pinter, we have Beckett, there are revivals of Shakespeare - but Tennessee Williams is the only American playwright being revived on Broadway in the fall.",
        "With all due regard to Beckett and Shakespeare and the other fine playwrights you mentioned, I'd put Tennessee Williams up against all seven or eight of them.",
        "(LAUGHTER)"

        "And so there are two primary concerns related to security.",
        "One is that, you know, social networks like Facebook and various other Web 2.0 technologies get viruses and other bad things onto government computers.",
        "The other concern, which is equally valid, is that government employees are putting more and more and more personal information out on the open Web, where it can easily be found and used perhaps in nefarious ways."
