        "How was she caught?",
        "And how common is her situation?",
        "Well, Elvira Arellano - for the last year, since August when she took refuge in the church in Chicago - had been holed up there and had not set foot outside of it, even though she was quite active as a spokesperson for her cause.",
        "And then finally, she gave a press conference last week, announcing that she planned to start to leave the church and lobby members of Congress, and appear at rallies.",
        "She did not tell - she did not announce that she was going to Los Angeles.",
        "And according to people that I spoke with who were with her, she was actually quite secretive about how she got to Los Angeles.",
        "She drove non-stop.",
        "But she was very public when she was in Los Angeles speaking at several rallies and churches.",
        "And after she left, one of them - agents surrounded the vehicle she was driving in and then they very quickly arrested her, and within a couple of hours, she was across the border in Tijuana, Mexico.",
        "And not only she was a spokesperson for her cause, her son appeared as a spokesperson as well.",
        "Yes.",
        "Her son, Saul, is now 8 years old.",
        "But he's been at this now for a year.",
        "And he has addressed the Congress of Mexico.",

        "Yeah.",
        "There is approximately 3.1 million U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants according to estimates.",
        "And it is a fact that as enforcement is stepped up in the interior, more and more illegal immigrants who are deported are going to have U.S.-born children.",
        "And - but it's also the case that activists, on behalf of those illegal immigrants, recognize that this is a compelling argument or at least they think it's a compelling argument.",
        "And so they have started highlighting a lot of these cases in the last year, Saul being the most prominent one.",
        "Trying to use this as an emotional issue to argue their case for immigration reform."

        "Exactly.",
        "And on the other hand, they accuse - immigration activists accuse the government of saying, look, why are you doing this now?",
        "These are not the kinds of - these businesses that you're raiding aren't exactly, you know, this is not homeland security issues here.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "I mean, it's still the case, even though interior enforcement is - there's been step up in terms of the number of illegal immigrants that we have, it's still a drop in the bucket.",
        "And so the charge on the part of the immigration activists is that this is being - that the stepped-up enforcement that we're seeing, that the raids that we're seeing are more being done to get political points and to attract attention and to sort of bolster the administration's credibility when it says that it's serious about enforcing immigration law.",
        "And the - they're saying that they're enforcing the law.",
        "They're actually going after the employers and then finding the illegals who work there as sort of a byproduct.",
        "Though a lot of people would say, look, you're arresting and deporting hundreds and hundreds of undocumented workers.",
        "And so as far as we can tell, the employers aren't getting punished.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, whenever they do one of these raids, employers who can be shown to have knowingly employed illegal immigrant workers are - you know, that is a crime and they are prosecuted, but it's still a very small proportion.",
        "I, you know, I was looking at the numbers, and it's in the, you know, it's about - I think it was like 716 people were criminally arrested in 2006.",
        "You know, and some of these are illegal immigrants who were using false Social Security numbers.",
        "So even that is not the number of employers.",
        "Think about the number of employers in the entire United States - that's not a lot of people.",
        "That's not an awful lot of people.",
        "So it's a selective prosecution, in other words, people are saying.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And you mentioned this before, I just wanted to clarify.",
        "When these kinds of raids happen, it is a different kind of illegal alien than the people who are typically arrested at or near the border.",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "I mean one thing, I think, that is not necessarily well understood is that the vast majority of people who are deported every year are caught as they're trying to come across the border.",
        "The year for which - the most recent year for which we have statistics is 2004.",
        "And it's only three percent of illegal immigrants, who were deported, had been in the United States for more than three days.",
        "That's about 51,000 people.",
        "So once you're in, at the moment, you have a pretty good chance of remaining.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And there are, of course, their children who are American citizens.",
        "People have also pointed out, Saul, Ms. Arellano's son, he is an American citizen.",

        "And that they're purposely having the children in the hopes that someday, once the child is older or turns 18, that they will then sponsor their parent for, you know, for residency.",
        "You know, having interviewed a lot of illegal immigrants myself and seen them with their children, I haven't really met anyone who seems quite that cynical.",
        "I think it's more of a natural situation where people have children, you know.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And what kinds of - when the government first started stepping up raids, she was cleaning airplanes at O'Hare Airport, and this was - she was discovered in the aftermath of 9/11 when the security cracked down on all kinds of things.",
        "Typically, the government - what kinds of places are being raided?",

        "Here in Connecticut, there's the case where a judge, who is been nominated for the state appellate court, tried to - has said on the bench several times that illegal immigrants were not eligible to use the court system, which is not what the case law or the state constitution says.",

        "N.C., can you help him?",
