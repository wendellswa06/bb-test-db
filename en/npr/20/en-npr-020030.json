        "Her American-born son stayed here in the U.S., he's a citizen.",
        "There are some three million American-born children of illegal immigrants in the country by one estimate, and more of their parents will likely get swept up in immigration raids.",
        "While activists on both sides gravitate to stories like these, do stories like these change your mind on the immigration debate?",
        "How?",
        "800-989-8255, e-mail is talk@npr.org.",
        "Joining us now Michael Wishnie, a clinical professor of law at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.",
        "He and his students represent 30 illegal immigrants who were arrested in a federal raid in New Haven on June the 6th.",
        "Professor Wishnie joins us by phone from Maine.",
        "Nice to have you on the program today.",
        "Nice to be here, Neal.",
        "And do some of those people you represent find themselves in the situation of having children born in this country?",
        "Well, yes, that is the case.",
        "Though I should clarify right off the bat that it's the government's allegation that each of those people arrested is an illegal immigrant.",
        "We haven't conceded that, and that's what the courts will have to sort out.",
        "Okay, well, point taken.",
        "But nevertheless, there are some who find themselves in this situation, which, should they be found to be illegal aliens and deported, would make for difficult choices.",
        "Absolutely, many of the people arrested have lived in New Haven for many years, raising families, working, worshipping together at the church in the neighborhood, and have deep ties to this community."

        "And if they are illegal immigrants, though, they don't have much legal recourse?",
        "Well, one of the problems with our laws right now is that - and that's correct - is that our immigration laws do not offer opportunities for those out of status, with very few exceptions, to regularize their status.",
        "And that's a bit of a change.",
        "Historically, our immigration laws have offered people who've lived and worked here for many years, raising U.S.-born children in many cases, some opportunity eventually to regularize their status.",
        "But that's very much not the case today.",
        "Where was this raid conducted, and do you think that this raid and others like it are politically motivated?",
        "Personally, I came to this country legally from Canada, I'm a Canadian, and I went through a lot of paperwork, went the legal route, the medical, paid the necessary fees, et cetera, et cetera, and I feel bad for the lady, but, hey, for anybody that comes to America illegally just go back to where you come from, file the necessary paperwork, go on a waiting list, et cetera, et cetera, and when your number's due, you know, come to United States, just like millions and millions of other people have done over the years, and come to this country legally.",
        "Well, I do.",
        "First of all, on a broad level, I think much of the immigration enforcement we're seeing in the country these days - whether it's worksite enforcement or arrest at private residences, as occurred in New Haven - is motivated by politics, in particular, I think, by the determination of the Bush administration to establish that it's tough on enforcement even as it pursues a broader deal on comprehensive immigration reform.",
        "And I think that the arrests in New Haven earlier this summer were just one illustration of this broader, politically motivated law enforcement.",
        "And selective prosecution you're arguing?",
        "Well, certainly in the case of New Haven in which two days after the city council at New Haven, it's called the board of Aldermen, overwhelmingly approved a plan by the mayor to issue municipal ID cards to any resident in New Haven who wish to have on a purely optional thing.",
        "Less than 48 hours after the city council overwhelmingly approved this plan, ICE swept into town in the early morning hours, bursting through doors, rounding up, in the end, over the course of a couple of days, 32 people - all of them they arrested and placed into immigration proceedings.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line.",

        "Michael Wishnie, can you help her out?",
        "Sure.",
        "I can't answer you specifically about France, but I - it is the case that different countries have different rules.",
        "Some grant citizenship based on the location of the child's birth that is within the country, regardless of the status of the parents.",
        "Other countries condition the citizenship of the child on the status of the parents.",
        "In the United States, it goes back a very long way.",

        "citizen.",

        "And so, if the parents have engaged in some wrongdoing, the child, nevertheless, is innocent of that.",
        "And Janine, I can tell you, my son was born in London 23 years ago and that was just a couple years after they changed the law from children born in that country were automatically British citizens to saying, children born in that country would be regarded favorably if they chose to apply for British citizenship, but it was no longer automatic.",
        "I see.",
        "So…",
        "I don't know the laws in other countries, I just happen to know that one.",
        "All right.",

        "Interesting.",

        "But children often pay a price for their parent's mistakes.",

        "It's an issue that's difficult, there's no question about it, but there is no clean resolution for this, one way or the other.",

        "But because of that nudge-nudge, wink-wink system, as you call it, these people, like the Arellanos, like the people that Michael Wishnie represents in New Haven, have been in this country for a long time, have established roots, and have established families, and these kids - well, they don't know what life in Mexico is like.",
        "They're Americans.",
        "They are indeed.",
        "And - but the question is, do the illegal immigrant parents get a pass simply because they mistakenly came into the United States and then had children?",
        "I agree, actually, with N.C., that there's not a lot of people who calculate in Mexico to come have a kid so that they'll stay here.",
        "That doesn't happen.",

        "First of all, the mythic, sort of, opportunities of the past aren't there right now, and it's easy enough to debate numbers and waiting lists.",
        "But if you're waiting 20 years for a close family member to join you, the reality of human history is that families will reunite.",
        "And we can take account of that reality and adapt our immigration laws to the 21st century, so that they do allow some opportunity for those outside the country in a reasonable period of time to come, and so that those who've been here for many years, productively working and paying taxes, can remain.",
        "But it's simply not the case, that most people who are here are going to go back, even President Bush says, look, there are maybe 12 million people in the country, we're not - who are here without status, we're not going to deport all of them.",
        "The more time we spend pretending we're going to deport people and making people's lives miserable while Congress debates, the longer we put off the meaningful solution that everyone recognize is going to come from Washington.",

        "But in this end game, there's sort of a frenzy of enforcement that is arbitrarily going to ruin lives of those thousands who are swept up before we come to our senses and adopt a 21st century immigration policy that serves the needs of our economy, our national security, and our communities."
