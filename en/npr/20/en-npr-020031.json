        "I mean, he's been quite explicit about that.",
        "Now, that's not what was in the legislation, but that is what he has openly supported.",
        "And the idea that the enforcement initiatives now are politically motivated is correct, but it's the wrong political motivation that a lot of people - wrong conclusion people are drawing.",
        "The clear goal here is - Secretary Chertoff made this clear as well - give the people what they want good and hard to show them that the immigration law - the consequences of enforcing the law, in other words, make things as bad as possible in their view by trying to shut down companies, et cetera, through enforcement in order to get business and even the public to start clamoring to their congressmen for a legalization, for an amnesty.",

        "Well, it is.",
        "And it's certainly inflicting an enormous amount of pain on individuals and families.",
        "And that may well be the goal.",
        "And it's certainly been the case in recent years that regardless of where people start in the immigration, that they - in the political arena, when raids happen in their home district and business leaders and clergy and community leaders and local politicians come to senators and congressmen to say that this is terrible, this hurting business and families and parishes, then those political voices tend to shift a little bit.",
        "I think it's a - I think you're certainly correct.",
        "There's a lot of space between President Bush and a lot of others in the immigration debate.",
        "But think it's telling that a border-state Republican, who has a different feel for these issues, is pushing for sort of sensible, practical immigration laws.",
        "And that Secretary Chertoff himself keeps saying, give me a law I can enforce.",
        "Allow me to focus on the terrorists, the drug smugglers and the human traffickers.",
