        "You can't see she wouldn't have existed, or she'll come in and philosophically prove that we don't exist either.",
        "That, too.",
        "But, no, there certainly were artists like Madonna and Duran Duran, who I've just mentioned, even Michael Jackson, all of whom exploited the medium to get more famous than they might have been otherwise.",
        "In the case of Michael Jackson, you're talking about someone who had a significant music career already and would have gone on doing so.",
        "But he understood the power of that medium, as Madonna did, and used it to become worldwide famous, more famous and to sell more records than anyone had imagined possible before then.",
        "Is that the primary change, do you think, that MTV has created in the entertainment industry?",
        "Well, MTV has created many, many changes over the years.",
        "Perhaps it was easier to talk about what these changes were when they were only 10 years old because now, 25 years on, really MTV is mainstream.",
        "Four or five years on, you would have said MTV's affect was changing the way that television commercials looked, the television shows like Miami Vice looked, that movies like Flashdance looked.",
        "The original idea was that MTV was going to be put music with everything.",
        "You wouldn't be able to turn on the TV without seeing somebody sing in the middle of whatever it was you were watching.",
        "But MTV has continued to change with the culture, to get out in front of it in whatever way they can, and actually, as you said earlier, what MTV has given us is reality television.",
        "Instead of music everywhere, we see real people everywhere.",
        "Well, they still do play some music videos.",
        "You know, that's absolutely true.",
        "It's a common complaint and it's usually made by people who have recently graduated from high school, that MTV doesn't air videos anymore.",
        "But they certainly do if you know where to look for them.",
        "They're on before school and after school."

        "If you get up at seven in the morning and turn on MTV, you'll see videos.",
        "If you come home from school, well, elementary school, high school, at 3:00 in the afternoon, you're going to see some videos on TRL or their hip-hop countdown show, Direct Effect.",

        "You have to know where to look for them.",

        "But for most of its existence, MTV has been part of mega-media conglomerate Viacom.",
        "Well, that's certainly true.",
        "I don't think that means that they don't have some subversive content on the network over the 25 years or still today.",
        "Again, as you pointed out, MTV was breaking down barriers with its non-music programming on The Real World, and MTV is still one of the places that treats the idea of gay and lesbian life as commonplace.",
        "So, after seven years working in the video game industry, Woo says, he may have to switch to a completely different field.",
        "If you watch their dating shows now, and many of their shows are dating shows - they have five or six different reality dating shows, it is no big deal for them to show a gay or lesbian couple trying to hook up, as they would say.",
        "There's no fuss made over this.",
        "Part of what they're saying to their audience, and they do appeal to that audience in a libidinal way, is that this is everyday life.",
        "This is part of everyone's life.",
        "This is part of mainstream life.",
        "And in America today, that would still qualify as a subversive message.",
        "I would say, also, that, you know, MTV has been tremendously important, in fact crucial, in the spread and dominance of hip-hop in popular music in America.",
        "And that, too, has had many subversive messages over the years.",

        "Well, I'm - I was in one of those households that got it on satellite when you first could get it on satellite because cable didn't have it.",
        "And I've grown up watching it.",
        "And I'm 25, myself.",
        "And so I just feel like, you know, talking to the points that were just made, yeah, there were a lot of things that came out that were groundbreaking and revolutionary and culturally important on MTV.",
        "But I feel like nowadays when I turn on MTV, I'm saddened by the way it reflects my generation, that all we seem to care about is money and shopping and not really contributing to the world.",
        "We just want to look good and we want to have bling and we've listened to the same 10 songs over and over.",
        "And that kind of upsets me about MTV.",
        "I miss the MTV I grew up watching.",
        "So, I mean, that's just how I feel about it.",
        "I wonder what you think about that, Joe Levy."

        "You know, they don't make those hip-hop videos, all of which celebrate - well, not all of which - but many of which celebrate commodity, material goods.",
        "And yet, true as that is, they do make an awful lot of television shows, reality shows, that also celebrate commodities.",
