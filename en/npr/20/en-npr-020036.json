        "Hi, how are you?",
        "Very well, thanks.",
        "I just wanted to make note that I grew up in South Carolina, and we're obviously not as fashion savvy as some of the faster-growing states, but the way that MTV affected me - I'm 35 now, so I think I was maybe nine or 10 when it first started out - and it absolutely changed the way I perceived everything as far as how you dress, how you act, how you go about being creative about one's self, pretty much everything from start to finish.",
        "Was that a good thing or a bad thing?",
        "Well, I think it was good in a sense that it made me seek out being creative in some ways, but I think it also sent me a little bit on the outer edge of what some people thought was normal.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But, I mean, I really shifted once I got to college when it seemed like MTV went in a different direction, so I kind of shifted once I got in college and didn't really watch it that much anymore.",
        "And I have kids now, and, of course, my niece and nephew also like to watch it, so it's just kind of an icon thing that you look back and you say, wow.",
        "We didn't used to have ATMs either, you know, so."

        "Yeah.",
        "I wonder, Joe Levy, the way Laura's describing it, it's almost as if MTV is a phase.",
        "You know, that's the way a lot of people feel about popular music.",
        "It's often the case that you love a band that remains your favorite band when you're graduating from high school.",
        "By the time you finish college, you don't discover four or five new bands.",
        "And so for some of us - not for me, I made a job out of it - but for some of us, rock and roll, pop music, hip-hop, whatever it is we loved at that moment that we're 17, 18, 20, it's not what we go on being involved in when we're 25 and have a full-time job.",
        "MTV is very much the same way.",
        "To be honest, I think MTV really does change about once every high-school class.",
        "Every four years or so, if you were to beam back in, you'd say what happened to what I liked?",
        "It's not there anymore.",
        "Well, of course, it's not.",
        "You know, a whole bunch of 12-year-olds came along and changed it as they moved up to 16.",
        "So, yeah, absolutely.",
        "I think that MTV is a phase.",
        "I think they know that.",
        "I think they heavily research the phase that their viewers are going through in order to keep up with them.",
        "And it's not just Laura in South Carolina who was influenced by the way she saw people dress and act on MTV.",
        "This has happened across the world.",
        "Well, that's absolutely true.",
        "You make an interesting point, which is that MTV has spread to be a global phenomenon, and it is indeed different around the globe, although there are some constants.",
        "You know, 50 Cent, Madonna in her day, these are global MTV constants.",
        "Whether you're in Japan, in Sweden, in England, in Asia, you know, you can find a different local MTV for all of those markets.",
        "So, yes, absolutely, it's been part of, well, pop music's worldwide dominance.",
        "Laura, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Bye.",
        "And joining us now is Jonathan Alter, a senior editor at Newsweek magazine.",
        "He was a consultant to MTV News back in the ‘90s and an on-air contributor.",

        "Thanks very much.",
        "We were talking earlier about that boxers or briefs moment when President Clinton went on MTV.",
        "Was that a transformative moment at the network?",
        "I think it was a transformative moment for Bill Clinton's presidency in that it became one of the best-remembered, in a negative sense, experiences of his presidency because it showed - it kind of summarized how he had, in some people's minds, trivialized the office.",
        "Of course, when Monica Lewinsky came along, boxers or briefs seemed kind of small potatoes.",
        "But that was not the transformative moment for MTV.",
        "That came two years earlier during the 1992 presidential campaign, when he took part in the first MTV town meeting with a politician - which later became quite common - in the spring of '92 when he was the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party but still governor of Arkansas.",
        "And I was involved in the planning and execution of that town meeting which took place, as well as later ones, which took place on a soundstage in Hollywood.",
        "And at the time that aired in, I believe, June of '92, it was a transformative moment.",
        "Exactly.",
        "There was a sense that he understood that, before the phrase old media or mainstream media was current, that he understood there were other ways of communicating with the American public.",
        "Around the same time, he went on The Arsenio Hall Show and played saxophone.",
        "But the MTV appearance, which got a tremendous amount of publicity at the time, really cemented the idea that he was a different kind of candidate and was going to try to appeal to younger voters on a different basis.",
        "What was MTV News trying to achieve, do you think?",
        "Well, it had started during the primaries, and I was involved with that as well, when I would do some on-air pieces where we would try to educate the MTV audience about the (unintelligible) of American politics.",
        "So I did a segment once on, you know, what's the difference between a primary and a caucus, for instance, and this was cut with the MTV-style, music video-type editing.",
        "The producer was Alison Stewart, who is now on MSNBC, and at that time, she was a very innovative producer at MTV.",
        "And she and Tabitha Soren really changed the way MTV covered politics.",
        "And that whole year, they were out covering the campaign, and I would sometimes work with Tabitha in producing these interviews.",
        "She interviewed Bill Clinton about five times before the boxers or briefs town meeting in 1994.",
        "So this had been going on for a while, and they had a good relationship with the White House.",
        "The Oval Office door was always open to Tabitha Soren and MTV because the White House, the Clinton White House anyway, understood that MTV could be of great use to them."

        "There wasn't a spike.",
        "I'd call it a little bit of a blip.",
        "I mean, I remember going on MTV on election night, 1992, and saying that, you know, young people had helped elect a new president.",
        "I was in Little Rock.",
        "It was very dramatic.",
        "And then when we looked at the numbers, you're quite right, it wasn't nearly as dramatic as we were suggesting when the actual numbers came out.",
        "But it was still of some significance.",
        "And at least, you know, tonally, people felt like it did matter who could relate, in terms of coolness, to the American public.",
        "And then, as you mentioned with the MTV ball, you know, for hundreds of years they've been having inaugural balls, but in 1993 - on January 20, 1993 - when Clinton was sworn in for his first term, that night the MTV ball was the hot ticket.",
        "That's where everybody wanted to go in Washington.",

        "You'd get a taste of, you know, what band was out there and popular.",
        "But really what I wanted to talk about was - and I was, I think I was a junior in college, this was like '79, 1980 - but what I do remember about MTV when it was starting to come out is that the only black faces that you saw at that time were Michael Jackson.",
        "Not even plural, singular for that matter.",
        "And I remember that, you know, as a young black student in school, yeah, it was interesting, but I also felt that it was somewhat biased.",
        "And in fact, there was a little bit of a brouhaha that came up, because when rap started becoming - it had already existed in the late ‘70s - but when rap started becoming mainstream, that's when MTV came out with Yo!",
        "MTV Raps, which for me was really the black version of MTV.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And there was some problems and there was some - I guess there was something in the news about how MTV was somewhat biased and not portraying or not giving air time and video time to those performers.",
        "And as a matter of fact, I felt that that continued with The Real World when you had the black comedian that was awkwardly placed in there.",
        "And it felt as if he wasn't the right character to be in that scenario and kind of reminded me of the fodder, the joke that a lot of comedians came up with, you know, in a horror movie the minority is the first one to get killed off.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah, the minority crewmen on Star Trek, always the first to go.",
        "Exactly.",
