        "It's a very fair criticism.",
        "It would be a very far criticism of radio at the time as well.",
        "You know, Michael Jackson didn't just break the color barrier at MTV.",
        "He broke the color barrier at rock radio in 1982 or '83, which really was playing no music by black artists either.",
        "And it was the start of something, through the mid-80s, different.",
        "The start of a moment in time when Prince was as much a rock artist as a dance artist, as was Michael Jackson.",
        "There were artists on both sides of the color barrier that could cross over to different radio formats.",
        "You might hear, for God's sake, George Michael on black radio in New York City.",
        "It happened.",
        "I was there.",
        "I can tell you.",
        "Today we're talking about MTV, which turns 25 years old today.",
        "Our guests are Joe Levy, executive editor of Rolling Stone magazine, on the phone from his office in New York City.",
        "And also with us is Jonathan Murray, co-creator and now still executive producer of MTV's The Real World, who's with us on the phone from his vacation spot in Cape Cod.",
        "Let's get a caller on the line.",
        "And this is Eric.",
        "Eric calling us from Phoenix, Arizona.",
        "However, it is a very fair criticism of MTV at the start.",
        "I would say that MTV actually was instrumental in bringing rap mainstream in 1987 and '88 when Yo!",
        "MTV Raps started.",
        "That really was the moment.",
        "Rap had certainly existed for a number of years at that point, but that was the moment when hip hop went mainstream on the radio, on MTV.",
        "And MTV was stunned, absolutely flabbergasted by the popularity of Yo!",
        "MTV Raps.",
        "As I remember at the time from talking to people who worked there, they were amazed.",
        "It instantly became a dominant force on the network.",
        "And hip-hop has remained a dominant force on the network since then.",
        "When MTV started MTV 2, because MTV no longer played enough music videos, they wanted to start another network that was devoted to music video - by the way that network is now 10 years old and shows a lot of cartoons - but hip hop is a very, very important part of MTV as well.",
        "So, although, it's a fair criticism of MTV at the start - and in fact, a fair a criticism of The Real World, which generally has a token character, whether it is a character of color or a character with a different sexual orientation.",
        "You know, The Real World is not five gay people and one straight person.",
        "Generally, a Real World cast is five straight people and one character that might becoming to terms with his or her sexuality.",
        "So, these are fair criticism quite frankly.",
        "That said -",
        "I would surmise that that - and I feel that things have certainly changed as you alluded to earlier - you have representation of, a varied representation in The Real World, such as, you know, the gay/lesbian hook-up and whatnot.",
        "I have yet to see a biracial hook-up.",
        "But I don't know.",
        "I can't swear to you that it's happened.",
        "But wouldn't be surprised if it has.",
        "But I, you know, off the top of my head, I can't say.",
        "Exactly."

        "I wonder if you just heard that criticism.",
        "Is that fair?",
        "You know, it's always difficult when you're putting a show together, because whoever you put on it, often you sort of feel like, gee, do they have to represent a whole race or do they have to represent the sexual orientation.",
        "But if you go back to our third season - you know, back to 1995, The Real World San Francisco - we had Pedro Zamora, a gay HIV positive cast member who ended up having a commitment ceremony to his black boyfriend, and he was Latino.",
        "And so, you know, I think The Real World has broken a lot of barriers.",
        "It's not perfect.",
        "Nothing ever is.",

        "You wouldn't have gotten a scripted character like that.",
        "So, sometimes reality can take you places that scripted can't."
