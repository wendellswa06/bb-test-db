        "Well, we'll get some official Census Bureau numbers next week, but there are a couple of census veterans at a small firm called Sentier Research that keep track of this on a month-to-month basis.",
        "And they say that, adjusted for inflation, household income at the statistical middle of the middle class may have risen more in 2015 than any single year in more than a decade.",
        "Their data suggests that in June 2016, the median household income was about $57,200, and that's 2.5 percent higher, adjusted for inflation, than it was a year earlier.",
        "OK, so not exactly going to go out and spend wildly on a party with that 2.5 percent raise, but it's a raise.",
        "Correct.",
        "And what's driving it?",
        "Well, I think that one thing that's going on is that many more people have jobs.",
        "In the past couple of years, the economy's added more than 5 million jobs.",
        "That obviously boosts the incomes of households.",
        "Average wages have begun to rise a little bit, although much less than one would have expected, given how low the unemployment rate is.",
        "But I think it's important to remember that these numbers are adjusted for inflation.",
        "So when inflation is low, when the prices of food and energy fall, as they have been lately, that boosts the economist's measure of household income just as much as a raise does.",
        "But people don't often look at it that way."

        "And really, the bottom line of it all, Ira, is that the events that take place literally within minutes to hours of exposure, for example in sexual exposure when an infected semen gets into the vaginal vault, it really is a point of vulnerability for the virus because it is not easy for that virus to find the vulnerable cell that it needs to get the infection started.",
        "So what the study really shows is even when you exclude those high-risk populations from these high-prevalence poverty areas, we're still seeing high prevalences of HIV.",
