        "And then once it starts to spread widespread, then really in many respects, there's no turning back.",
        "So if we're going to be doing things like prevention from a variety of modalities, be it vaccine or pre-exposure prophylaxis or circumcision or what have you, it's very important to understand those early events, which we refer to as a very short and small window of vulnerability for the virus but a sure window of opportunity for us for intervention.",
        "So it was really the scientific basis of how the infection gets started and what we can do to intervene.",
        "And so you're saying the earlier the intervention, the better?",
        "Well, it depends on - there are preventive interventions.",
        "And we need to know how a vaccine or a pre-exposure prophylaxis works, how circumcision works, how the gels that we're going to talk about in a minute or two work during those very early events.",
        "There's also the concept that was discussed in great detail at the meeting about early treatment.",
        "Namely, what I'm just mentioning now is how to prevent getting that infection initiated.",
        "But once it's initiated, there's a lot of good data that's indicating that the earlier you start therapy, the better off you are from the standpoint of not allowing the virus to form a non-eradicable reservoir, namely such a reservoir that even if you stop therapy after years, the virus is still there, and how you can prevent the really progressive destruction of the immune system, which takes place over years.",
        "So there are a lot of good reasons to try, if possible, to get people on therapy as early as you possibly can if you have the resources and the capability of doing that.",

        "Well, it was a study that was conducted in South Africa, and what it did is it gave women a gel that can be inserted into the vagina that's either a gel with no medication in it, which was the placebo, or a gel which contained a one-percent solution of a well-known anti-HIV drug.",
        "And the women were instructed to use it within hours before sexual intercourse and within 12 hours after sexual intercourse.",
        "And it was the first study - we refer to this prevention modality as a topical microbicide.",
        "It is the first study over many years that we've been trying that showed a very clearcut capability of preventing the acquisition of infection.",
        "And it really generated a lot of, I believe, justifiable excitement and enthusiasm in that this prevention modality has never been shown before.",
        "It's important because women now will have, as we move along, the capability of taking prevention into their own hands.",
        "Because in many countries, particularly in the developing world, women are not empowered to negotiate the protective means that they need, like the use of a condom by their male partner.",
        "So if we can get this type of thing going, which it will, I believe, it's a question of the study was very robust, the data were good.",
        "We need to do, obviously, another study to confirm it, and we need to see how to optimize the use of this gel, but there's no doubt that the data were very clearcut.",
        "And that's the reason why there was so much enthusiasm about it at the meeting in Vienna.",

        "And we know that women, especially minority women and African-American women in particular, bear a disproportionate burden of HIV in the U.S.",

        "You presented new research at the meeting that shows that many low-income, urban areas have HIV epidemics.",

        "That's correct.",
        "You know, when we think of the national prevalence of HIV in the United States, that's approximately 0.4 or 0.5 percent, still higher than some other Western, industrialized countries, but nowhere near some of the prevalences that we hear about from sub-Saharan Africa or parts of Southeast Asia.",
        "But what this first-of-a-kind CDC study showed was that in 23 cities across the United States, when we looked at high poverty areas, we found that the prevalence of HIV was in excess of one percent.",
        "In fact, the prevalence was 2.1 percent in these 23 cities, much higher than what we usually term a generalized epidemic, which is one percent."

        "Your study just looked at heterosexual infection rates.",

        "to really demonstrate the impact of poverty, race and HIV risk.",
        "Did the risks cross all ethnic and racial lines, it just depends on the poverty level?",
        "Well, this is another fantastic finding in this study, which was even when you adjusted for poverty in these areas or low socioeconomic status, the relationship between race and HIV risk disappeared.",
        "For example, the prevalence among blacks in these high-poverty areas was 2.1 percent.",
        "In Hispanics, it was also 2.1 percent, and in whites, it was 1.7 percent.",
        "Now, these prevalences are unacceptable, but what it does say is that in these poor areas, the strongest determinant of HIV risk is not the individual's racial or ethnic background, but it's the low socioeconomic status which is driving other risk factors for HIV.",
        "Such as?",
        "So factors such as poor access to curative services, access to high-quality services.",
        "Of course, in many poor areas of the United States, you know that there are high incarceration rates.",
        "And there may be other risk behaviors such as transactional sex, commercial sex work, which can put individuals or communities at high risk of acquiring HIV."
