        "Dr.",
        "Fauci, does this indicate that we have become complacent or too complacent about HIV in this country?",
        "Well, certainly there are certain groups of people throughout the country who it has gotten off their radar screen.",
        "We've had HIV to our awareness since the summer of 1981.",
        "We've made major strides in treatment.",
        "We have an unacceptably high incidence rate.",
        "We used to have 120 to 130,000 new infections each year, back in the '80s and early '90s.",
        "It's now down to 56,000 per year, but that 56,000, Ira, has been that way for almost 10 years, which means we've reached a wall where we need to go beyond.",
        "And that's the reason why, with the CDC's new pushing, and I think it's very appropriate and very important to try and get as many people tested as you possibly can on a voluntary basis for a number of reasons: One, getting the people into therapy who would need therapy and counseling people.",
        "It's a shame, but in this country, of the 1.1 million people who are infected, 21 percent of them do not know that they are infected.",
        "And those are the ones that are most likely to infect others.",
        "So there is this degree that, well, we don't necessarily have a problem because you hear of all the staggering statistics from the developing world.",
        "But as Dr. Fenton has just mentioned, when you look at the statistics in certain populations in which there are health disparities, as he mentioned, then you really get shocked into seeing that we really do still have a significant problem in this country.",
        "We're going to take a short break and come back and talk lots more with Dr. Kevin Fenton, Dr. Anthony Fauci.",
        "Our number is 1-800-989-8255 if you'd like to talk about HIV and AIDS.",
        "Maybe you have a question or two you'd like to put to them.",
        "Also, you can tweet us, @scifri, @-S-C-I-F-R-I, a question or two if you'd like.",
        "Also, go over to our website sciencefriday.com where we're having a discussion online there, and you can leave a comment.",
        "So stay with us.",
        "We'll be right back after this short break with Dr. Kevin Fenton, Dr. Anthony Fauci and your questions, 1-800-989-8255.",

        "Dr. Kevin Fenton is director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, and Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
        "Our number, 1-800-989-8255.",
        "Dr. Fenton, earlier this month, President Obama laid out a new domestic AIDS policy.",
        "Will that aim at this epidemic of AIDS in the poor communities around America?",
        "I am very convinced that it will.",
        "You know, this is the first national strategy that we've had which really provides a strategic vision and goal for ending the epidemic of HIV in the United States.",
        "And the president in this strategy has identified three overarching priorities, the first being reducing HIV incidence in the United States, the second being to reduce health disparities and promoting health equity when it comes to HIV, and the third is really focused on improving access to high-quality health services.",
        "So all three of those priorities will have a significant impact on the work that we need to do in terms of prevention approaches that move beyond individual-level risk to address some of the environmental, social and structural factors which are driving HIV in the U.S.",
        "today.",
        "Here's an interesting tweet that came in from Doug Yeager(ph), who says: Could the antiviral in the gel be added to the lubricants in condoms?",
        "Dr. Fauci?",
        "Well, let me get you to read for us that moment when Dwight is first confronting the little gentle blue pill that purports to be able to change his life around.",
        "No.",
        "You don't want to put any lubricants on condoms because that generally tends to make them break.",
        "A condom is a physical barrier, and the physical barrier is all you need.",
        "If the physical barrier is intact, then you're good to go.",
        "You don't need nor would want an anti-viral layer.",
        "So I would be afraid of getting solutions, and sometimes people do that, put some types of lubricants on, and that really does not do good for the integrity of the condom.",
        "So you keep the gel, when you have it, in a situation where you add an antiviral, which as I just mentioned earlier, worked very well.",
        "Let's go to Louis(ph) in Bethesda, Maryland.",
        "Hi, Louis."

        "Well, the study was performed in heterosexual women.",
        "It was a vaginal - the use of microbicides for anal intercourse is not out of the question at all.",
        "That was not the study that was reported in Vienna, but in principle, the use of topical microbicides could theoretically work in situations where you have receptive anal intercourse.",
        "But the study that was conducted was among heterosexual women in South Africa.",
        "Shawnee(ph) is in Charlotte, North Carolina.",
        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Yes, thank you for taking my call.",
        "My question that I had was why - how do we come to the decision to use South Africa as a population to test the gel compared to other developing countries, such as India or even South Asia?",
        "Well, the reason that South Africa was chosen is that the sites that had been developed which had a very good handle on the incidence and had people who were coming to the clinic, were developed by the South African investigators.",
        "So this was not just our parachuting into a country, as it were, and deciding we're going to do a study there.",
        "This was conducted by South African investigators, and the report that took place in Vienna was reported by the South African investigators.",
        "The study was using NIH-funded sites, and the study itself was funded by USAID.",
        "So it isn't as if we chose Africa.",
        "Those were the ones who came up with the idea.",
        "They had a population of individuals there who were in dire need of a topical microbicide.",
        "So it was very relevant for them.",
        "I might mention that there are studies going on in a number of other countries, including in Asia.",
        "So this microbicide study is the one that was reported but there are a number of other studies going on."

        "Oh, wonderful.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "So, but we would have to further study, conduct tests in this country before the gel would be available.",
        "Well, what usually is the case, Ira, is that the FDA, our regulatory authority, when they make a decision about the use of any intervention, particularly if you're using it in healthy people, it's not therapeutic, you want to make sure about safety, and you want to be absolutely sure it works.",
        "Even though, as I mentioned earlier, the data look quite robust and quite good, in general, the FDA would like a confirmatory study both for the safety and for the efficacy and to get that percentage of efficacy up.",
        "Now, we were discussing this in Vienna that it is conceivable that in some countries in which the incidence and prevalence are much, much higher than in this country, where the health authorities may feel that given the situation that they have, they may want to roll this out as quickly as they possibly can.",
        "Now, the material is not ready to go and put on the shelf, but I can assure you that there will be some countries that will move more rapidly on this because of the individual needs in that country.",
        "And, in fact, the South African health minister had mentioned that he was very enthusiastic about this and he would like to move as quickly and as expeditiously as possible, within reason.",
        "1-800-989-8255.",
        "There was another bit of good news from the meeting that more people than ever are receiving the antiretroviral therapies.",
        "The numbers are up, Dr. Fauci.",
        "Yeah, they are.",
        "They're indeed up.",
        "There's - we were talking about - just a month or so ago, about four million people on therapy.",
        "There are now over five million people.",
        "That's really a testimony to a number of things, including the extraordinary impact of the president's emergency plan for AIDS relief, the PEPFAR program that was started under President Bush and continued under President Obama, the Global Fund, the Clinton Foundation, the Gates Foundation, and the number of the governments themselves.",
        "The South African government made a really nice presentation about what their plans are in enhancing the availability of drugs for a larger number of people in their population.",
        "So the numbers are really going up, and the more we can get on treatment, the better.",
        "Dr.",
        "Fenton, what about funding for HIV research in this country under President Obama's new plan, is it adequate?",
        "I never heard a researcher say any amount of funding was adequate before."

        "So I don't expect you to say so either.",
        "Well, you know, and it's great that Dr. Fauci is on the line because NIH does have quite a bit of the share of the HIV research monies.",
        "But certainly from CDC's perspective, we have an active interest in looking at research to build the prevention toolkit, to ensure that we're continuing to expand with effective interventions or new tools to fight the epidemic.",
        "And that will require resources.",
        "But we also recognize that these are very tough times economically, and so therefore, while building the investment pool, we're also at CDC looking at ways in which we can partner more effectively, to look at using our resources more efficiently to ensure that we're doing the research that's needed to help us to get ahead of the curve in the United States.",
        "Well, would I be correct in saying that what you're saying is that you're not getting an increase in funding, but you'll make do with what you have?",
        "What I am saying is there are needs, and we need to continue to invest in research.",
        "That has to be a priority moving forward.",
        "But in the meantime, we have to also build our programs and use our resources even more effectively.",

        "1-800-989-8255.",
        "So Dr. Fauci, where do we stand in the war against AIDS and HIV now?",
        "Where is the front line?",
        "Besides the pockets of poverty and the epidemics we have here, are we any closer?",
        "Was there any talk about a vaccine?",
        "Yes, there is some good news about vaccine over the past 18 months and even most recently as a few weeks ago.",
        "You know, Ira, we had discussed actually on the show, that's some time ago, about a year and a half ago, there was the first trial that took place in Thailand that showed the first inkling of some success in blocking acquisition in a trial of 16,000 people in Thailand.",
        "It was a very modest effect, about 31 percent, but it was the first positive signal.",
        "What we had a couple of weeks ago, two to three weeks ago, was the description of the identification in some patients of antibodies that when you look at what they can do - and those are the proteins that the body makes to block the virus - that there are antibodies now that have been identified that can actually knock out or block more than 90 percent of the known strains of HIV.",
        "And you might ask, why is that important with regard to a vaccine?",
        "Because we're using those antibodies to identify the component of the HIV envelope, the outer covering of the virus, that is actually the critical part that you want to make an antibody against."
