And the difficulty of approaching all problems in psychopharmaceutical terms is meant to be discussed a bit when Dwight gives this Amazonian Indian one of his pills in hopes that this will help solve this guy's problems.",

        "He goes after her thinking that that's what his trip is about, that's what his journey's about.",

        "I think that one of the things that I needed to do in this book was to write from the standpoint of a character who's a bit less well-educated and I think a little less intelligent than myself.",
        "And neither of us are too intelligent perhaps, but Dwight is less intelligent than I am, so that he could approach these fundamental questions as if they could still be asked.",
        "Because I think sometimes the sophisticatedness or the ostensible sophistication of people in my generation gets in the way of our asking these questions.",
        "The assumption is that the answers have been already arrived at.",

        "That's no particular aspect of any generation.",
        "But what irony referred to was a kind of an inability to take seriously any of one's thoughts or feelings and ultimately an inability to take seriously one's self.",
        "And I think Dwight manages slightly by the end of the novel to begin to take himself a bit seriously.",
        "When you write about this affliction of indecision and it certainly suggests--the book implicitly suggests that it's an affliction of our times and particularly of a certain age group.",
        "Is this something you have seen all around you?",
        "Yeah, it reminds me a bit of those, you know, episodes of \"\"Leave It to Beaver\"\" where the kid who is in trouble would always speak of the trouble as belonging to one of his friends rather than himself.",
        "So I suppose I'll say that I've seen it all around me.",
        "Well, talk about that a little bit if you could.",
        "Well, you know, it's obviously not an affliction of everybody in the world, only a small segment of the world, but I think for a number of people in my generation, there's been a kind of explosion of freedom without any sort of similar capacity to handle the opportunities that spread themselves before us.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
