        "Certainly, it is.",
        "And that was one of the things that people were arguing for and asking for them to delay, or at least try and give notice, is that so people would at least be able to try and get home, try and come back and at least go through, because one of the things we have to remember is that we're not necessarily talking about physical structures that are standing.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "A lot of these places, as Dr. Berry implied, these places are rubble, rubbish, just refuse left over, but they do want people to at least be able to come home and perhaps go through it and see if they can find anything that means something to them.",

        "But really, I think the ideal that we should seek is just that there is lobbying on both sides, that's it not intimately tied to the sleazier sorts of exchanges of money and trips that we're talking about, because we can admit that lobbying can actually concentrate forces for justice, if it's done right, and would inevitably arise in any governmental system.",
