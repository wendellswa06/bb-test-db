        "Well, what it is, all of this is part of on the political side and Bob, you're right on.",
        "It's part of the whole attack on the kinds of changes that are taking place in the academy that have made it more inclusive so that there are people there as students who wouldn't have been there before.",
        "There are classes there that wouldn't have been there before, many of which need to be there because it reflects the changes in knowledge and the changes in interest that ought to be there.",
        "And so this whole thing about left bias and all the rest of it is all part of an attack and one should look at the website and take the whole thing, take it whole, and decide where the motives are and whether one would support it, I would think.",
        "All right guys.",
        "We had hoped to get into an incident that happened last night at another NBA arena where Antonio Davis of the New York Knicks went into the stands for fear that someone was harming his wife, but we're running out of time.",

        "Of course, going back, going 50 years now, the holy grail of electronics is really to shrink the parts, to make them smaller and smaller, and that's one of the reasons why the early days of solid-state electronics were funded by the military so they could build these tiny circuits that fit into military satellites.",
        "And that search for shrinkage is still a driving force in digital technology.",
        "Scientists have taken a logical step - sure makes sense, doesn't it?",
        "You take two of the smallest objects that you can find, nanoparticles and DNA molecules, you combine them together to make DNA computer circuits."

        "How do you make DNA and non-living things like nanoparticles work together?",
        "Well, what we're trying to do is actually use the DNA molecule as a template to assemble these nanoparticles.",
        "The DNA we're using is an engineered DNA, you might call it.",
        "It's called DNA origami.",
        "It was - the design of this was developed by our collaborator at Caltech, Paul Rothemund, and what it amounts to is a single molecule of DNA that's actually relatively large.",
        "It can be formed into a shape, folded back and forth on itself so it's in a two-dimensional shape.",
        "The size is about between 100 and 200 nanometers on an edge and it's about two nanometers thick.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And depending on how you make it, this thing can - the DNA can be shaped into things like triangle, or rectangle, or five-pointed star - even things like a smiley face.",
        "And that's all very interesting, but what we want to use it for, there's a second attribute of this DNA origami and that is you can put patterns on the surface of this DNA structure.",
        "And those patterns consist of little posts and you can bind nanoparticles to those posts.",
        "And the thing that's interesting to us is the posts can be as close as six nanometers apart, so that the nanoparticles you'd put there, which we hope will ultimately be made into transistors, can be put at very fine pictures, very close together.",
        "And that's the interest in trying to use DNA to fabricate microchips.",
        "So you don't care about the chemical composition.",
        "You care about the fact that you can use the DNA as sort of a building block, as sort of a skeleton to put your nanoparticles on top of.",
        "That's exactly right."
