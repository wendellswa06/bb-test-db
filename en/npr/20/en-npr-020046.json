        "How do you get a molecule of DNA to behave the way you want it to behave, to make this shape that you want it to make?",
        "Yeah, that's - the way it's done is you start off with a long single strand of DNA.",
        "As you recall, DNA normally exists as a duplex, two single strands wrapped together in the famous double helix.",
        "And what Paul's technique involves, is starting with a fairly long single strand of DNA that's isolated from a virus.",
        "And then, he has prepared very short pieces of DNA.",
        "He calls them staples.",
        "And what the staples do is interact with a long single stand in the same way that normally happens when you make double-stranded DNA, but they're designed so that the staple - half of the staple reacts with one segment of the long strand, another half reacts with the other, and that forms a loop.",
        "And then he has several hundred of these strands together and they just self-assemble.",
        "You mix the single strand of DNA, you mix all 200-odd strands that he's designed using a - the composition of which he designed using computer program - you mix them together, you heat them up, the DNA hybridizes, he's precisely to find nanostructures form and that's it.",

        "And there - we've designed it so that their binding sites that match the shape of the origami, and they have a property such that origami sticks to them.",
        "So, we've, sort of, got this silicon wafer covered with tens of millions, we can, of these sticky patches.",
        "And then, you just pour the solution containing these shapes onto the wafer.",
