        "Yeah, so the sequence is you prepare the DNA nanostructures and solution.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And then, you prepare our lithographically fabricated template with the sticky patches.",
        "Right.",
        "Then, you pour the DNA nanostructures, and they line up where you want.",
        "And then the next step is to put the nanoparticles on.",
        "And I think -maybe they didn't say enough about these sites on the origami.",
        "There are actually also little segments of DNA, single strands of DNA.",
        "And you can design those so that you can take the compliment of that single strand of DNA and put it on the nanoparticle.",
        "And then those match up.",
        "They do this - the familiar Watson-Crick base pairing.",
        "And then, these - the nanoparticle will find the site that it's basically coded for.",
        "And the advantage of the origami, in addition to being able to put these sites very close together, you can make them, sort of, individually addressable, because in principle each site can be different, and so each site would be specific for putting a different kind of nanoparticle down or a different sort of nanorod or carbon nanotube.",
        "And would you then use these sites to make transistors out of them or memory circuits?",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "That's the ultimate goal.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So you basically can make memory at the size of a DNA molecule.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It would be - the memory would be made at the size - that's right, because the DNA molecule is two nanometers.",
        "But the size would be determined by the - actually, the size of the component you put on, the nanoparticle you put on."

        "We have a couple of different kinds of templates that we use to line the structures up, but we're still trying to optimize it because, as you know, if we ultimately do try to get this into - make a chip, the performance tolerances and the alignment overlay issues are very stringent."
