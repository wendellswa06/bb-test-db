        "And my sources in Congo say that they might need to get pretty radical because you can't just fight this with guns because if you do that, you're just going to play into this narrative that the national government is using Ebola as a way to gain power.",
        "You need to spread the message that this is not a political issue, that this is something that, you know, affects everyone.",

        "But that just makes people wonder, are the people who are getting vaccinated people who have connections, you know?",
        "And why isn't everyone getting vaccinated?",
        "So medically, it might not make sense to do as much vaccinating, but from a public perception point of view, it does.",
        "And then, you know, similarly, there's discussion that they just need to do even more to really ensure that everybody in the community is given the same resources, the same jobs, that no one group is benefiting economically from this Ebola outbreak; so really addressing these underlying perceptions and realities, frankly, as a way to remove Ebola as a political weapon make it no longer a reasonable argument that this, in fact, is just being used by one side to gain power.",
