        "She has used the experience as the basis for new and innovative approaches to her art.",

        "Your daughter, Geneva, was born in 1991.",
        "When did you notice that she had a different way of approaching the world than other kids her age?",
        "Well, I guess the first thing that I suppose should've been a clue, but in the '90s, it wasn't that prevalent, was you could make a lot of racket, like, behind her, and she wouldn't turn around.",
        "She would be so engrossed in what she was doing, you know?",
        "But her language seemed normal.",
        "She was starting to say words at six months and nine months and putting, like, three-word sentences together at one year.",
        "But when she was 18 months old, she stopped learning new words and then a few months later stopped using the words she knew.",
        "So by the age of two, she just wasn't speaking at all.",
        "Her language disappeared.",
        "So when I talked to the - you know, our family doctor, that was just like flags going up everywhere.",
        "It's not normal to have language and lose it.",
        "So then she was very shortly after that diagnosed with autism at the age of two.",
        "So when the doctors told you that your daughter had autism, fill in the blanks for me.",
        "Tell me what they told you to expect.",
        "Well, that was, I think, the most difficult part, and I have to say I probably cried every day for like two years - not the way I felt about my child, but every time I had to take her for MRIs and these tests and diagnoses, just the kind of negativity and kind of fear that was inspired from what the experts said to me."

        "Did it impact you as an artist?",
        "Well, it did pretty much early on because I started questioning notions of normalcy, like what was and wasn't normal, and you know, what society thinks is normal and those, like, value judgments that are placed on, and I did a series called \"\"Anomalies\"\" where I did portraits of existing people that were outside of the realm of normalcy, either physically or mentally, neurologically as in the case with my autistic daughter.",
        "Did you think about or experiment with how language affected your artwork?",
        "Well yes.",
        "My most-recent series, which are these pen-and-ink drawings with photographs that I've taken, I just thought well, I would like to not do figurative stuff and not anything political or kind of social commentary but just something that's more free, and using graphics and pen and ink kind of as a language to just sort of explore another world.",
        "So I was very influenced by her in my most-recent series.",
        "She actually stopped talking a second time.",
        "How old was she, and how did that happen?",
        "Yeah, that was strange.",
        "She was maybe 13, just like maybe the second semester of middle school, and she was into her preservation, which is a common thing autistic kids do.",
        "They'll repeat the same thing over and over and over again, or she's talking to her imaginary friends non-stop, and my husband, I'm sure he regrets it, but he took a timer, and he set it to give minutes, and he said could you just stop talking for five minutes?",
        "And she stopped talking for a year and a half.",
        "And I don't know if that was why, or if that implanted the idea or if it was just a control thing because she's really into control, but she did not say one word, even by herself.",
        "He'd like kind of spy on her.",
        "She'd make noises, but not one word.",
        "Just the incredible discipline of that.",
        "It must have been heartbreaking.",
        "Yeah, that was just like is this going to happen - is it going to be like this forever?",
        "Is she just going to never start talking again?",
        "Because she didn't really start talking again until she was seven years old.",
        "So between seven and 13, she was talking, and then..."
