        "You're alluded to the credit crunch, and we've seen the lending community by and large cut off the credit that was making housing affordable for a lot of households, and that - what that's meant is that we have a glut of properties on the market that weakens the price power.",
        "And in addition, a lot of the folks who got into those initial mortgages, are using some of the alternative mortgage products, have found that those products didn't really work for them and that they're struggling to meet those payments having to consider foreclosure, default, reworking, and that also has weakened the housing market.",
        "So, the overall picture is pretty week particularly in high-cost markets, but it's weak very much across the board.",
        "Now, when you say weak, is this something that's hurting say the big mortgage lenders and the investment banks or neighborhoods or both, and how?",
        "It's hurting all of them.",
        "It's hurting the banks and the investors because they were expecting returns, and the defaults and delinquencies we're seeing are eating away those at rates that no one was really expecting, at least no one at the banks were.",
        "In terms of the homeowners, foreclosure and loss of housing is always very painful.",
        "It's always disruptive and a traumatic experience.",
        "And then for neighborhoods, what we're seeing in terms of where these foreclosures are is that they're concentrated in particular areas.",
        "And those areas where we see a hollowing out of the homeownership and of the residential occupancy, that has its own negative spillover effects that we all will wind up having to face and deal with at community level.",
        "Lynnette, you are someone who's an expert in really talking to people directly about how their finances work.",
        "But give us a little bit of the big picture in terms of how African-American families and neighborhoods have been a part of the housing market, some of the challenges that we face, and, you know, some of the ways that we might bring a little bit of baggage from the past into, you know, the transactions we make today."
