        "Well, I think there's no question that the African-American market has been disproportionately hit by the mortgage meltdown that we saw that began in August of 2007, and as you know now continued into 2008 and is being manifested in the credit crunch.",
        "When you look at the types of loans that African-Americans in particular receive, for instance, there is pretty much a uniform belief and statistics to back it up that groups is varied.",
        "There's the Federal Reserve, the Center for Responsible Lending, the Consumer Federation of America.",
        "They've all done studies and have statistics that show, for instance, that African-Americans, black women in particular, were two to three times more likely to get subprime loans or predatory loans than their white counterparts.",
        "And that's frankly regardless of the person's credit.",
        "I think in years past, people would be steered into high-cost loans.",
        "And the rationale, the justification if you will, was always, well, of course, they have to pay more to get a loan.",
        "They have to have a higher interest rate because they have bad credit.",
        "But what we're seeing now is that many people who frankly had quite good credits still wound up with subprime loans and/or predatory loans.",
        "And the spill-out that we've seen now that's really become quite a drag on the economy overall is obviously getting a lot more attention, because it's not just an issue confined to minority communities.",
        "Indeed, millions and millions of homeowners all across the country at every income level at every neighborhood and community in some way are being impacted by these.",
        "I tell people all the time because I hear from both sides, both individuals who've been badly hurt by the mortgage meltdown and are having problems refinancing or selling or are facing the threat of foreclosure, those people clearly are in dire straits.",
        "But then, I also talk to consumers, who say, listen, I'm dong quite well for myself and I'm okay.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "And I don't see why I should have to, you know, have financial problems because the next guy or my neighbor down the road didn't pay his mortgage or didn't read his loan documents carefully or et cetera, et cetera.",
        "And what I tell both is that we're all in this together.",
        "Surely, there is blame to be apportioned here because in many cases, lenders were, dare I say, reckless in terms of determining who should really qualify for a mortgage.",
        "Certainly, some consumers did stretch and overreach and try to take on more mortgages than they could truly afford.",
        "Obviously, Wall Street banks were getting rich off of mortgage-backed securities, selling and packaging loans and then, you know, selling those in the secondary markets.",
        "So, obviously, too few questions were asked there.",
        "But let me get Raphael into this.",
        "You know, with all the things Lynnette is saying, it sounds as if there's a situation where we were just doing what we are supposed to do, meaning Americans were chasing the American dream of owning a home, and people did many things to get it that may not have been smart.",

        "I think that's exactly right.",
        "And, you know, one of the issues is that we haven't sent the message that homeownership really isn't a right, it is a privilege, and it comes with cost obligations and burdens.",
        "And collectively, our society has not placed homeownership in a position such that people who are chasing homeownership actually understand that there are potential consequences.",
        "And I did want to actually just comment on the issue about this being concentrated in the black community.",
        "That actually is true, and it's true in terms of what types of mortgage products you get, but it's also true in the context of the foreclosure problem.",
        "So, some research that I've done would suggest that even after you control for credit quality and all those sorts of issues, foreclosure is much more prevalent in a lower - in lowering minority communities.",
        "And we don't really know why.",
        "You know, some of it is certainly steering.",
        "Some of it is also, I think, lower level of sophistication in terms of financial literacy in the black community.",

        "You're someone who bought a house a couple of years ago, thought that you were doing the right thing in terms of getting a loan and then you find out, oh gosh, my loan is a subprime loan.",
        "What do you do now?",
        "Lynnette?",
        "Well, first, let me say that just having a subprime loan in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing.",
        "It was not necessarily meant to be punitive to borrowers.",
        "Subprime really just refers to a category of borrowers who did not meet the upper-tier qualifications for any bank's lending requirements.",
        "In other words, maybe they didn't have the highest credit score.",
        "Maybe they didn't have a sufficient down payment, et cetera.",
        "If you didn't meet those qualifications, then you are put into a category called non-prime or subprime.",
        "The problem is if you have a predatory loan or a loan that has onerous rates and terms, very high interest rates, high fees attached to it, excessive pre-payment penalties, perhaps a balloon feature that, you know, would make it difficult - any of those things that make it difficult for you to either sell or refinance.",
        "The conventional wisdom is, clearly, if you've had, say, an adjustable rate mortgage that is about to reset on you or if you had a mortgage that, for whatever reason, had some terms that were untenable, clearly, the opportunity is there to - for some to try to refinance into a fixed-rate product, something that is less financially detrimental to you."

        "They engaged in overbuilding, and that's part of the problem as well.",
        "Well, let me get Raphael into this again.",
        "You know, when you hear Lynnette talking about who should get the benefit of government funds that are used to leverage a change in the industry, what exactly - if you're a homeowner who's in trouble or if you're someone who's wanting to buy a home, what's on the horizon for you in terms of positive things that might actually change your situation?",
        "Are there any of these structural changes from the government or from lenders that might benefit individual homebuyers or homeowners?",
        "Well, for the homebuyer group, I think the biggest change is going to be a much more rigorous application of underwriting standards.",
        "So the likelihood that you'll get into a mortgage that you'll learn two or three years later you can't afford is much lower now.",
        "Now, that has - it comes with this cost because that means that you can't afford as much a house today that you could a year ago, but its better to get into house you're going to stay in than to get into house and figure out you have problems.",

        "I can afford this amount, and let's see what we can do.",
        "Many credit councilors will be able to work with you, if they've got enough scale.",
        "They can go to banks, they can revise and try to get those contracts revised and get you into a mortgage product that is more useful."
