        "So your reporting finds that federal aid doesn't always go to those who actually need it most, right?",
        "Explain that, if you can.",
        "So here's how it happens.",
        "The federal government spends a lot of money every year rebuilding and also on preventing future damage.",
        "So that's things like giving out money for a down payment on a new apartment, let's say, or helping you buy a new car or even buying out properties that have flooded repeatedly so no one else will live there.",
        "So you might assume that that money would go to the people with the most need...",
        "Yes.",
        "...But, actually, the aid is often going to Americans with other safety nets.",

        "But you have to have a certain credit score to qualify.",
        "And that's to protect the taxpayer because if you don't pay the money back, we all do.",
        "Right.",
        "So - but the problem is people who have more money often are able to maintain a higher credit score.",

        "Right.",

        "- because if, let's say, you don't own your home, if you rent your home, then the government can't buy it from you.",

        "Even among homeowners, white people are more likely to get a buyout.",

        "Now, for context, the whole country is about 62 percent white.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And, often, it's along racial lines.",
        "So I talked to two researchers who looked at the whole U.S.",
        "at the county level, and they found that, on average, black people tend to lose wealth and white people tend to gain wealth after disasters.",

        "I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada.",

        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "Canada's treasury board president, a woman named Jane Philpott, wrote a public - scathing public letter arguing that Trudeau had broken what she called a fundamental doctrine of the rule of law.",

        "He's now called for the prime minister to resign, and he's calling for a probe by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.",
        "But what's the motive, Brian?",
        "I mean, why - according to the allegations, does Trudeau have some kind of relationship with this company?",
        "This is a big company in Montreal, which is Prime Minister Trudeau's base of political support.",
        "And with elections coming, the argument seems to have been that this - by going fiercely against this company, it would have cost jobs and would have cost his Liberal Party votes and an important part of the province of Quebec."
