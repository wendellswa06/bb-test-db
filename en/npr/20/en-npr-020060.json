        "Well, that's basically trying to get at the really visceral, raw dimension of disgust that's not very common and not very thought-through.",
        "It's that really creepy, yucky feeling of, for instance, stepping in dog poop accidentally or, you know, looking into a public toilet and noticing that it hasn't been flushed and used a lot of times, that kind of thing.",
        "So it's very physical and basic.",
        "We should warn people, we're going to get disgusting this hour.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "But one of the fascinating things you learn in your book is these are things that have to be learned or traits.",
        "Not everybody's disgusted the same way.",
        "You learn how to be disgusted by things.",
        "Yeah, I mean, I think it comes to a big surprise for most people that the idea that, you know, toilet's not flushed and things like that would not be inherently disgusting.",
        "But actually we first learn that poop is disgusting with potty training, and that lesson usually takes place around the age of three.",
        "But before that, you know, newborns and young children will play with their feces and have no problem.",
        "Young kids as well, older than three, have no problems, you know, picking up something dead off the ground and bringing it to mommy to show them and things like this that we really have to become socialized to learn what the signals of disgust are.",
        "And interestingly, you open your book talking about some of the strange foods that people eat around the world to make a point that different cultures are disgusted by different things.",
        "Absolutely, and so that's a great place to see learning kind of writ large when you look a culture, and you see these vast differences in, for instance, what fermented deliciousness is preferred in any given culture and how another culture can consider it absolutely repulsive.",
        "I think a great example, in fact, is cheese just because it's so simple, and for us it seems, most of the time I think, to be anything from a comfort food to a real delicacy.",
        "And for instance, Asians consider it to be the equivalent of cow excrement."

        "So the idea that we adore something, and other cultures find it hideous, you know, we think, well, that's not logical.",
        "But there are things in Asia that they eat that we would find entirely repulsive.",
        "But the interesting underlying thing here is that none of these foods are in fact dangerous.",
        "So it's not like we're ingesting poisons, and don't those Asians know better than to be eating 100-year-old eggs, and they're going to be falling over any second, or don't those Westerners know that that cheese riddled with blue stuff is poison.",
        "So it's interesting that all these products are in fact safe, and the origins of disgust are really about protecting us from things that would be poison.",
        "Do - so there's no natural disgust genes in us that when we taste something, we spit it out thinking that's poisonous?",
        "Well, that's actually not true.",
        "It is the case that bitter is inherently unpleasant, and we will spit that out instantly if we can, if something bitter gets in our mouth, and that's because bitter is typically a signal for high levels of alkaloids, which typically signal poison.",
        "And so the bitter taste reaction is hard-wired and is ingrained from birth, and we will try to expel those kinds of tasting things, but beyond that, the disgust reaction, which goes well beyond the idea of spitting out bitter taste, is learned and culturally determined.",
        "You were mentioning that when you give even young infants a little taste of something a little bitter that they make the disgusting face right from the beginning.",
        "Right, that was actually one of the things that first really turned me on the field of disgust.",
        "I thought it was completely fascinating that a basic taste, like bitter, instantly from birth, would elicit the expression in a newborn that you would make if I said could you please hold your neighbor's dirty dentures.",
        "Disgusting.",
        "So I think that - yes.",
        "But it's pretty - it's very interesting in the origins, and also the part of the brain that controls taste is the same as the part of the brain that controls disgust.",
        "So the fundamental origins of disgust are rooted in our perception of taste and particularly the rejection of bitter taste which, as I said before, tend to indicate toxins."

        "But from then, it really morphs into something very complex, abstract and uniquely human.",
        "Is it possible to unlearn something that you learn to be disgusting?",
        "Yes, I think definitely - I mean, at least you can modulate it down.",
        "So people who, for example, have to be exposed to disgusting things for periods of time develop tolerances to them and find them OK.",
        "So for example people who are emergency workers or work in hospitals and have to deal with blood and guts and body fluids all the time may initially begin their jobs feeling highly repulsed by these sorts of things.",
        "But then they just become used to it, and so we can definitely become inured to the signals of disgust.",
        "It's also the case that our culture, again, what we're used to can make a big difference in terms of what we find disgusting.",
        "If, you know, there are no sewers around, and waste is everywhere, then for instance the smell would be, you know, the smell equivalent maybe to a fast-food restaurant here.",
        "You know, it's not maybe your favorite smell, but it's everywhere, and it's OK.",
        "But is repulsive the same as disgusting?",
        "I'm thinking of a smell like a skunk smell that's sort of universally disgusting, right?",

        "Were you excited by the reception?",
        "And the reason why, for instance, the smell of skunk is not universally unpleasant is because our responses to smell are learned, just like our responses to disgust are.",
        "So if you first encounter the smell of skunk in a context where you thought it was a good smell, you will then think it's a good smell.",
        "And if you didn't get schooled in eww, that's disgusting, you'll be surprised later on if you make this confession.",
        "I have heard other people say that.",
        "But I guess what I meant to say was that the skunk has that smell for a reason, right, and it must be because most things, or most animals, find it disgusting and repulsive.",
        "Well, it's dealing with its own specific local predators, and we are not part of the skunk, you know, typical predator domain.",
        "I mean, we don't go around eating them.",
        "We may accidentally kill them by running them over, but we are not part of the skunk natural predator system.",
        "So the natural predators of skunk would be repelled by that scent.",

        "Hi.",
        "Well, I'm hoping that you can solve a lifelong problem for me.",
        "I was raised a vegetarian, as were my kids, and I cannot for the life of me figure out how people decide to be utterly repulsed by one kind of dead animal where they think that the other kind of dead animal looks good, smells good, tastes good.",
        "And, yeah, I'm just curious to hear the answer to that.",
        "You mean like why someone who's a meat-eater can eat a cow but not a cat, or a cat is repulsive...?",
        "Exactly, you've got it, right there.",
        "Like when my kids, someone gave our family a ham one time for Christmas, and my kids carried it out and buried it, and they were just grossed out, while I realize it's somewhat, from what you're saying, societal.",
        "But there has to be more to it than that because people get really grossed out over a cat but not a cow, and they're both dead."

        "Well, that's actually a great question, and in fact there are cultures, for instance, in China where cats can be eaten.",
        "And your issue about pets versus the things we find in the supermarket is exactly the issue of an animal that we bring into our home and bring into our family.",
        "So we bring our cats and dogs into our lives like we bring children in, and the idea of eating them is close to the concept of cannibalism and, you know, completely abhorrent whereas the things that we see in the supermarket when we go to the meat section, first of all it's lost all connection to its animal origins.",

        "I've actually wondered, if people had to do more serious hunting, you know, whether or not they would be a little bit more reluctant to eat food and/or if we had to see, you know, eye-to-eye the whole cow, you know, hanging dead in the butcher shop whether we would be so excited about a filet mignon.",
