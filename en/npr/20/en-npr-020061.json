        "So that's also a very interesting question, and part of it may have been Gabriel's original experiences with the smell of papaya being different from his wife and his daughter.",
        "But it's also the case that recent genetic work has discovered that, in fact, everybody has a unique nose.",
        "And Gabriel may have certain receptors inside his nose that are particularly attuned to one or two aspects of the papaya bouquet that make it unpleasant for him, whereas his wife and his daughter do not.",
        "And potentially, the other people he knows have the same issue, or they have a combination of this issue, plus a bad experience with a papaya in the past.",

        "You write in your book getting off of foods for a little bit about other disgusts, that people are disgusted with their bodies.",
        "Why would our bodies disgust us?",
        "Well, we're not usually so disgusted by our bodies, but we're disgusted by other people's bodies, and specifically the things that come from their bodies.",
        "And that's because one of the key features of the emotion of disgust is to keep the outside - especially outside stuff coming from other people - away from our inside.",
        "And this is the connection with disease, as well.",
        "So we want to protect ourselves from becoming contaminated by the cooties and the oozy-gooeys of other people.",
        "However, again, the situation and the context makes an enormous difference.",
        "So, you know, a stranger's saliva - someone who licks your face in a grocery store, for example, that you have no idea who they are - that's going to be horrendously repulsive.",
        "But if your lover does that to you in the bedroom, it could be totally erotic.",
        "So again, it's the meaning of the situation.",
        "It's the meaning of the trigger that determines if it's disgusting or delightful.",
        "So that - odors that you give off may not smell so bad to yourself, but the same odors that someone else gives off smells awful.",
        "Absolutely and - yeah.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And it's not just our own odors.",
        "We think that the odors of the things that are - make our family or ourselves are also OK.",
        "So, for example, if you're changing your own baby's diaper, that dirty nappy smells OK to you, but if you had another infant of the same age, their dirty diaper would smell gross.",
        "And even the case that we think that our own dog's breath is better than a stranger's dog's breath.",
        "So, you know, the things that we bring into our family, into our home, the intimates, those people are OK when it comes to their body products, typically.",
        "But the outsider, the stranger, that's where it gets dubious and disgusting.",

        "And in the medical field, it's kind of a longstanding joke that there are certain things - you know, one person can deal with blood and guts, but another person can't.",
        "Or one person deals with the top part of the body, and the other person can't stand that part, but can deal with the bottom part of the body.",
        "And I just find that really fascinating that, you know, that - those things that disgust us sort of translate into this.",
        "Well, my one thing, I can't handle oral care, or I can't handle blood or poop or pee.",
        "So I think it's really interesting that that's kind of, you know, translates into the medical profession, as well.",

        "And she - do people get better acclimated, Rachel, as they get older to what's disgusting, or being more accommodating?",
        "People definitely get better acclimated as they get older.",
        "But just going back to Erin's point, it's also the case that we all have our disgust personality predisposition.",
        "So one person may be more disgusted by certain things - let's say oral care - and someone else is more disgusted by poop, or someone else is more disgusted by dead things and someone else is more disgusted by blood.",

        "So it really depends.",

        "But it's also the case that everybody, regardless of their personality, as they get older, they get less disgust sensitive, and it's not necessarily clear why that happens, but there are some interesting hypotheses, if you'd like me to share them.",
        "Sure, sure.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Well, one idea sort of stems back from everything we've been saying so far, which is just that as your - you get older, you've been there, done that, seen it so many times, smelled it so many times, et cetera, so you're more used to it.",
        "It's less disgusting.",
        "Another possibility is that the neurotransmitters in the brain that are controlling the disgust experience are damping down.",
        "They're less active.",
        "There's less of it.",
        "So we get less of an intense response.",
        "But what I think sort of philosophically is my favorite possibility is that disgust really, at its core, is about our fear of death and our trying to protect ourselves from death in all sorts of ways.",
        "And as we get to the end of our life, maybe we've become somewhat more accepting of that fact, and therefore, the whole gamut of things that are disgusting become less of an issue or a problem for us."

        "Does disgust about morality work the same way - violence, disgusted with violence and, you know, things like that?",
        "Well, again, I think it's - you know, that's certainly a great question, and it has to do both with your exposure and your experience.",
        "For instance, you know, if you're exposed to a lot of violence and a lot of bloodshed, I think that you do definitely become inure to it.",
        "At the same time, I think certain professions - like if you're a police officer, for instance, and you have to deal with shootouts and accidents and that sort of stuff, because you're constantly reminded of your mortality - in fact, you know, assuming that you're not particularly old, you might become more disgusted of things.",

        "That - I was thinking, reading the book is, why are we drawn to horror movies, you know, which feature dismembered bodies, gory stuff, chainsaw massacres, things like that?",
        "Well, that's also a fantastic question, and it's connected to the issue of death again, and something else.",
        "So, first of all, with respect to death, I think that the horror show enables us to explore some of the mystery of the extremes of death - you know, Freddie killing all these people in incredibly crazy ways - and we think, well, you know, it couldn't be that bad.",
        "So if we can tolerate that, then maybe some of the fear of our real death is attenuated somewhat, and sort of the mystery is taken out a little bit.",
        "Another answer to the question is to do with this seemingly strange predilection that we have called benign masochism, and that is that we actually like to do things which seem dangerous or seem disgusting or horrifying, as long as they don't actually really hurt us.",
        "So, for example, bungee jumping, taking roller coaster rides, eating habanero peppers, doing those sort of things and going to see horror movies is like testing the limits, and we seem to enjoy doing that as long as it's not actually going to cause us harm."
