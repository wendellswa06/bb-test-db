        "So if it's a no vote, what do you expect to happen and how soon will you be seeing change there in Greece?",
        "Well, if it's a no vote, the government says that it will have a mandate to go to the European Union and the International Monetary Fund and say, we don't want any more austerity.",
        "Look, the votes say that.",
        "So let's negotiate a deal that doesn't include more austerity and helps the Greek economy grow.",
        "But the question is, will the Eurozone and IMF want to come to the table because there have been a lot of bad words exchanged between the two - a lot of angry words exchanged between the Greeks and the Eurozone side.",
        "And what about a yes vote?",
        "A yes vote would probably mean that this government, which is a left-wing government, would resign because the prime minister says that he cannot carry out any policy that includes austerity - he doesn't believe in it.",
        "So if the deal includes austerity measures, he says he does not want to carry that out.",
        "So that means new elections, and that would be really hard for Greece right now because it doesn't have the money, first of all, to pay for these elections, and it would - it'd make things even more politically fractured here.",
        "What do you think people are most worried about as they're waiting for results?",
        "I think most people are worried about if Greece is going to continue to be part of the Eurozone.",
        "I think even the no voters are worried about that.",
        "I think Greeks really want to remain part of the Eurozone - every poll has shown that at least 60 to 70 percent of Greeks want that.",
        "And they're concerned that if there's a no vote, that Greece won't have that same opportunity anymore, that some path will be cut off.",
        "And again, if there's a yes vote, they're concerned about political instability that's going to lead, maybe by default, to a Eurozone exit because you won't have a government able to marshal the resources to be able to put together a workable plan to deal with what is a financial crisis and the fact that Greece is almost out of money.",

        "Does it seem to you something is going on with information coming out about what the senior military leadership wants, seemingly contrary to what Mr. Bush wants?",
        "I don't think there's any doubt about it.",
        "I think the problem has been clearly in the government on the civilian side that has been deceived in the run-up to the war.",
        "There's been gross mismanagement of military assets during the war, and a shocking lack of understanding of the political and cultural realities in that part of the world.",
        "It's just amazing to me that there hasn't been more discomfort on the part of senior military, and I must say senior civilians as well, that are not political appointees.",
        "I don't recall statements coming out of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, albeit unattributed but clearly leaking out of there, saying this is what we think the military should be doing in the next year, two years, and it's contrary to what the civilians want, it's contrary to what the president wants.",
        "I don't either.",
        "I think it's high time that the senior military people start to speak out.",
        "The civilian leadership, both elected and appointed, have responsibility for policies.",
        "The question that I would ask is, what is the responsibility of the senior military when you know these people are making bad decisions?",
        "Here we are today with 3700 Americans killed and about 25,000 wounded.",
        "I think that constitutes a moral responsibility to speak out.",
        "We just heard Michael Desch conclude his interview with Alex Cohen, saying how do officers know what to do; it's not always a black and white decision.",
        "Well, the trouble is, is this issue is rarely raised in the more senior educational institutions within the military.",
        "As young officers we're all told to argue vigorously with your boss until a decision is made.",
        "Once the decision is made, your responsibility is to carry out the mission as stated by your boss.",
        "I think that works very well for lieutenants and captains on the ground in combat.",

        "Well, clearly Mitt Romney - what we saw in Michigan, Alex - is making a case that he has experience in dealing with economic issues, and even pointed out last night that at one point John McCain had told reporters that, you know, he's still learning when it comes to economic issues.",
        "McCain shot back that that wasn't true.",

        "Janet, who exactly is leading the charge here and what sort of reform exactly is this group calling for?",
        "Well, the CEO of Safeway, the grocery chain, put this group together and they called themselves the Coalition to Advanced Healthcare Reform.",
        "This includes more than two-dozen heavy-hitting company leaders, like CEOs from General Mills, Pepsi and Aetna Insurance.",
        "Safeway CEO Steve Burd is the driving force behind this group.",
        "He has a Web cast on the Safeway Web site that explains why he thinks this a critical issue for businesses to take on and he also penned an op-ed in today's Washington Times.",
        "Burd says that businesses and insured people end up paying more for health care to subsidize those who don't have insurance.",
        "And he says by next year, the average Fortune 500 company will have a health care bill that exceeds its net income and he says that's already happened at Safeway, which is why its attention has been drawn into this.",
        "But while Burd is calling for national reforms, it's interesting to know that many of his own company employees have to pay for their own healthcare or go without it at least initially.",
        "That's because of new union rules that were signed a few years ago, thousands of Safeway employees have to wait up to 18 months before the company kicks in any health care benefit contributions.",
        "So what kind of reform exactly is the group calling for?",
        "Well, an article in the L.A.",
        "Times today says that a lot of these reforms, Alex, are similar to what California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's proposing for that state.",
        "Essentially, the group wants everyone to be required to get health care insurance and carry it with no exclusions for pre-existing conditions.",
        "They want government assistance available to low-income people so that they can get coverage and they want there to be incentives that would promote healthy behavior.",
        "And also the group says that health care premiums should be tax-deductible for individuals so that if you are a freelancer and you pay for your own health care that would end up being tax-deductible.",
        "I'm sure there are lot of folks quite happy about this, but what's the new reaction overall to these plans?"
