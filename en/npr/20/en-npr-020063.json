        "But also, he's putting in contrast.",

        "Well, he's talking about the idea that's central in Israel's founding - Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people - and taking this concept and writing it into what's known here as a basic law that's somewhat on par with the U.S.",
        "constitution.",
        "So it would potentially increase the influence of Jewish values as reflected in the government of Israel.",

        "Israel was not only founded as the nation-state of the Jewish people.",
        "It was also founded as a democracy.",
        "The declaration of independence guarantees the, quote, \"\"social and political rights of all inhabitants of Israel.\"\" So much of the opposition is centered around the worry that this will make Israel less democratic by reducing the status of non-Jewish citizens to something perhaps second-class."
