        "Does being a Jewish state automatically mean that other people would be second-class?",
        "That is really central to the debate here.",

        "He also said the proposed legislation, as he sees it, seeks to set a new hierarchy not balancing democracy with Jewishness of Israel but putting Israel as a Jewish state above Israel as a democratic state.",
        "Well, in the end here, we're talking about a proposal that affects Israel's identity rather than anything more concrete like an economic plan.",
        "What has made this something that has started Netanyahu's coalition toward cracking up and perhaps leading to elections here?",
        "This is not the only thing that is leading to the coalition breakup.",
        "The mix of parties in this coalition has had a lot of difficulty since they came together almost two years ago.",
        "Economic budget issues have been major disagreements - also the relationship with the U.S., which hit some real lows over the past months.",
        "But this proposal to enshrine the Jewish character of Israel into a new basic law is seen by many Israelis as somewhat of a litmus test for politicians.",
        "What is a leader's vision of Israel?",
        "And in that sense, it's divisive, and it's coming at a time when the ties binding the coalition partners were already wearing thin.",
