        "Now, let's start with a question that was sent in by Andrea Asuaje of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and she asks this - how exactly are Ebola patients treated for the disease, aside from isolation?",
        "Well, of course, everyone is interested to learn about drugs that are specific to treat Ebola but in truth the most effective treatment available right now is to treat the symptoms.",
        "This is called supportive care, it means making sure people get IV drips, to give them plenty of fluids, to replace the salts and minerals they lose by being so sick.",
        "They get oxygen if they need that and if they get an unrelated bacterial infection they'll get an antibiotic for that.",

        "Nothing proven, Richard, but we've been hearing a lot about experimental drugs that are being used.",

        "And they fall into three categories.",

        "If one of the regular antiviral drugs happen to work, well, those can be produced fairly rapidly, so that would be hopeful.",
        "And production of the drugs that bind to the viruses RNA would take a long time to ramp up as well.",

        "We do get a lot of questions about this.",
        "And the answer is yes they do build up immunity.",
        "The CDC says these people are likely immune from the strain of Ebola for at least 10 years and possibly longer.",
        "And for that reason, these people are being recruited to take on some of the more dangerous jobs in West Africa.",
        "And because they're immune, that leads to another question because the blood plasma from some patients who have survived Ebola has been used to treat other patients.",
        "We know that Kent Brantly, the doctor, donated some of his blood to the NBC cameraman who has Ebola, also to another aid worker.",

        "The spacecraft is equipped with ground-penetrating radar, which does pretty much what you think it does.",
        "Ground-penetrating radars use radio signals that are capable of penetrating into the ground and then get reflections from the material under the surface."
