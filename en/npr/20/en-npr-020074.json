        "And we've gone through some ebbs and flows, but now we've reached a point where there really is a pretty stark political divide on the basis of not so much the particular denomination you attend but rather the intensity of your religious commitment or the intensity of your religiosity.",
        "And Bob Putnam, how do you read that link?",
        "What do you think is responsible for it, or is it just a statistical oddity?",
        "So there's been a kind of a quiet backlash among young people against this politicization of religion.",
        "And I kind of suspect that many thoughtful religious leaders are probably - over the next 10, 15 years, 20 years - going to start pulling back a little bit from the most vociferous political nature of religion, because they're loosing customers.",
        "I'm fascinated by the subtitle of your book, \"\"How Religion Divides and Unites Us,\"\" 'cause a lot of authors would have reversed that.",
        "It seems as if you're almost emphasizing the unite aspect.",
        "Could I get you to talk about that?",
        "And it's because of that mixing and matching and intermingling among different religions that we manage to accomplish something that is historically and internationally unique - that we're a religiously devout country, a religiously diverse country, and a pretty religiously tolerant country.",
        "Scott, can I jump in this?",
        "I wanted to add something to that, which is that I think part of the purpose of this book is to say to religious Americans: Actually, you know, seculars are not that hostile to you.",
        "And to say to secular Americans: You know, even religious people are not nearly so intolerant as you think they are.",

        "In the \"\"The Moral Instinct,\"\" an article published in The New York Times Magazine, Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker writes about a new sixth sense, what he called the moral sense - our ability to consider some questions as moral issues while others are addressed with the practicality of cost-benefit analysis.",
        "Take meat, for example.",
        "One person could be a vegetarian for ethical reasons to avoid causing pain to animals while someone else might be a vegetarian to lower cholesterol.",
        "For that person, it's a practical question of health, not morality.",
        "Today, psychologists, neurologists and biologists are trying to figure out how we make moral judgments and why, and why we newly elevate some issues to the plane of morality - smoking for instance - and learn to think of previously moral questions, like divorce, on a more pragmatic basis.",
        "And if this is a science, if the moral sense is hard-wired into our brains, does that reduce what many would regard as our best impulses to mere biology?",

        "Ovaries that aren't working don't produce enough estrogen.",
        "And when that happens early in life, the damage can go beyond fertility to also affect bones.",
        "The wake-up call we got was about 10 years ago, where we had twin sisters come to see us in our program, at age 23.",
        "They both had bone densities of a 77-year-old woman.",
        "Turns out, Nelson says, the twins had menstrual problems during adolescence that were never evaluated.",
        "They could've grown up with healthy bones, he says, if they'd been prescribed a patch to supply the missing estrogen and progesterone to balance it.",
        "I think a 30-year-old woman still needs these hormones.",
        "I think a woman in her early 40s probably still needs them.",
        "Once you get beyond 45, I think, then, it's more questionable.",

        "No Republicans are supporting the Senate bill, but two of them have signed onto the House version: Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina voted against the big campaign finance overhaul in 2002, but he sees this one differently.",
        "When this gets outside of Washington and people understand what we're trying to do, I believe I'm going to be correct when I make this statement: You're going to see the American people start taking an interest in this legislation and say return this government back to me.",

        "I mean, that can't be good for traditional retailers.",

        "For the companies, I think it's kind of a mixed blessing.",
        "Some retailers actually specifically go after smart consumers.",
        "So if consumers are smarter that's better for those retailers, especially if they offer better deals, better product, et cetera.",
        "But the downside is that consumers can find out that a store down the street, or an e-tailer, carries the same product that is at a cheaper price and then you lose the sale."
