        "And why do you think there is a science of morality?",
        "Morality is clearly a judgment that comes out of our emotions and our reason.",
        "It's a psychological phenomenon which may have objective counterparts but it certainly has psychological counterparts.",
        "The example that you raised of the two kinds of vegetarians, a phenomenon first discovered by Paul Rozin, is a wonderful example because the behavior is the same, avoiding meat, but the whole set of thoughts and emotions that go along with it very much depends on whether you think it's a moral decision or a practical one.",
        "To take one example, if a drop of meat broth falls into your vegetable soup, will you avoid even touching the soup?",
        "Well, if you're a health vegetarian, obviously, one drop is not going to raise your cholesterol levels.",
        "But if you avoid meat for moral purposes, then a mere drop is a contaminant and it compromises your identity even to taste it, and so you avoid it.",
        "Or you think, for example, that people who avoid meat are less aggressive and less animalistic, if you're a moral vegetarian.",
        "If you're a health vegetarian, you wouldn't make that kind of attribution.",
        "So it suggests that there's something in our psychology that goes along with being in a moral mindset, and so moral judgments are a topic in psychology and ultimately, biology just as color vision or smell is.",
        "One of the new tools that scientists have to use to take a look at our brain is the functional MRI that can actually see the brain in operation while it's making decisions about various things, and what is that show about moral decisions as opposed to other kinds of decisions?",
        "A nice example comes from the work of my colleague, Josh Greene, who looked at one of the favorite sandboxes for the new moral psychology, sometimes called the trolley problem.",
        "Namely, if you pose the following moral dilemma to people, a trolley is hurtling out of control, there are five workers on the track who are going to be killed as the trolley plows into them; they haven't seen the oncoming danger.",
        "You're standing at a switch; you can divert the trolley on to a sidetrack.",
        "Unfortunately, in the sidetrack there's a single man working who will be killed because he also hasn't noticed the danger - should you pull the switch?",
        "Saving five lives at the cost of one and just about everyone says yes all over the world.",
        "Now, if you change the physical terms of the problem, you say well, this time, you're standing on a bridge overlooking the tracks.",
        "You see the trolley hurtling out of control.",
        "The only way to stop it is to throw a heavy object in front of the trolley, and the only heavy object available is a fat man standing next to you - should you throw the fat man over the tracks?",
        "This time, people say it's not permissible to sacrifice one life in order to save five.",
        "Then you might think the mathematics are the same one - kill one, save five - why should it make so much of a difference how the physics work?",
        "Greene proposed the difference is that we have an innate revulsion, perhaps even rooted in evolution, to directly manhandling an innocent person.",
        "And so if you simply switch the track and then a chain of events occurs that will eventuate in a person getting killed, psychologically, that's different from doing it with your bare hands.",
        "And indeed, if you put people in a brain scan or while they're thinking through these dilemmas, that in the case of the fat man on the bridge problem, then an area in the frontal cortex that's associated with empathizing with other people lights up.",
        "And in the simpler problem where you simply have to divert the train onto a side track, that area does not light up.",
        "Also, in the fat man version of the problem, another part of the brain that's involved in conflict in weighing two things to decide which you should go with, lights up confirming that people are grappling in that case with a conflict between the calculus of one life versus five and the gut feeling that you can't hurl a struggling man over a bridge.",
        "And why does evolution enter into this?",
        "Why would evolution play a factor?",
        "The first suspicion is that some kind of moral intuitions are universal, not the same intuitions, of course, because in some cultures, it's considered moral to, say, kill your sister if she's had sex with someone you don't approve of, and in other cultures, it isn't.",
        "But the idea that there is a moral coloring to acts, that there are some acts that deserve to be punished, that ought to be discouraged, seems to be found in all cultures together with proscriptions against rape and murder and theft.",
        "A sense of empathy not always directed at every other human being, sometimes only to members of one's own clan.",
        "So the universality of morality is a hint that it might have an evolutionary basis, and models of how social cooperation can evolve point a finger at certain emotions like guilt and sympathy and gratitude and righteous anger as mechanisms to get people to cooperate without being exploited.",
        "And so the combination of the universality and the availability of a plausible mechanism by which moral sentiments could evolve suggest that it might be part of our evolved nature as is color vision or fear.",
        "We're talking with Steven Pinker of the family, Perth Johnstone family professor of psychology at Harvard about his piece \"\"The Moral Instinct\"\" that was published in The New York Times Magazine.",
