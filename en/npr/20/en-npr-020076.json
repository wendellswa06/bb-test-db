        "And Steve, the other thing you raise is that there are different ways of thinking about this.",
        "If you regard something as a pragmatic issue - again, going back to that example we used of the two vegetarians - the health vegetarian and the anti-meat vegetarian, if you think about it on a pragmatic level, where you're going to make decisions certain ways.",
        "But if you think about it as a moral issue, well, then, it is wrong - capital W - to eat meat and you should try to persuade other people from eating meat.",
        "There are certain actions that making a moral judgment dictates.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So even though I'm in favor of abortion rights, I've always objected to the bumper sticker that says if you're against an abortion, don't have one because that is equivalent to saying if you're against murder, don't kill someone.",
        "It misses the point that if abortion is a moral issue to anyone, then just agreeing not to do it yourself is not an option.",
        "It's like saying if you're against rape, don't rape someone.",
        "The very fact that it's considered moral by some people means that necessarily, it has to apply to everyone.",
        "Now, one could argue that, of course, in the case of abortion, the right of the woman trumps any right of the embryo or the fetus.",
        "And I think there is a legitimate argument to be made along those lines.",
        "But to trivialize it by saying it's just a matter of personal choice, I think, is to fail to engage the other side in a reasonable debate.",
        "And then how does something - and you make the example of smoking - go from something which was, hey, you can smoke, you don't smoke, no big deal, to, all of a sudden, becoming a moral issue?",
        "I think a lot of social and political and cultural change consists of moving behavior from the moral side of the page to the non-moral side or vice versa.",
        "For example, homosexuality is something that used to be considered to be immoral, as was almost every form of sex that didn't lead to children -contraception, pre-marital sex and so on.",
        "Now, we consider it just a matter of choice.",
        "Or divorce, atheism, homelessness, even, which used to have a moral taint when we would call someone a bum, which both implies that they have no home and that somehow they're responsible for it.",
        "Those are examples of behaviors that have become immoralized.",
        "On the other hand, things like, say, executive pay, which, a few years ago, would have been not a moral matter at all.",
        "If some corporation is stupid enough to pay exorbitant fees to some CEO who runs the company into the ground, that's none of my concern.",
        "But now, with concerns about inequality and of corporate mismanagement that leads to unemployment, it's everyone's business and it's considered a moral issue how much a CEO gets paid.",

        "Okay, Brian.",

        "Yes, there is a certain tendency, I think, to moralize the other guy's behavior as supposed to your own.",

        "The kinds of practices that are characterized urban elites tend to have more of a moral taint than ones that go on in their own communities.",

        "And you write that, in fact, this is - there are about five principles of morality.",

        "So there's a purity versus contamination mindset to moralization, which is also why we revere ascetic, spiritual leaders who dress in white and seem to be emotionally detached from the world as opposed to carnal, sensuous hotheads.",
        "There's also group loyalty and conformity to norms, which tends to get moralized.",
        "There is an avoidance of harming someone for no reason.",

        "And the weighting that they get differs from culture to culture and even between the left and right in our own culture, where Jonathan Haidt first formulated this five-sphere theory of morality.",
        "He's noted that liberals tend to put almost all of the moral emphasis on avoiding harm and unfairness.",

        "And I tend to think that aesthetic and religious experience, emotional, subjective experience, does give us access to a plane of truth that is quite apart from the material, scientific one and is no less true.",
        "But your theory, if I understand it - I read your article - says that emotions play a very key point in the process by which we come to moral decisions.",
        "And it seems to me that if - that the theory itself - which is to say that moral reasoning is the product of biology and evolution - affects the way we would approach, the way we understand the process of moral reasoning, which is to say if people don't think that the reason they do things is because it is transcendently, religiously, absolutely true but because it's the product of their biology and evolutionary process, doesn't this in a way interfere with the very foundation by which we come to a moral conclusion, which is an emotional one, by changing our view of the whole process of moral reasoning?",
        "Well, I do deal with that in the article.",
        "Indeed, I think there's a third alternative to the idea that morality is dictated by religious texts and the idea that morality is just a product of the wiring of our brain.",
        "There is a certain logic to morality.",
        "One of them is the logic of non-zero sum games.",
        "The idea that two parties can both come out ahead by behaving in certain ways and not others, so if I refrain from stealing your property and you refrain from stealing mine, we're both better off than if we're constantly raiding each other and feuding like the Hatfields and the McCoys.",
        "Or if I give you some of my surplus when I've got more than I can eat and you're starving, and you decide to do the same thing when fortunes reverse, we're both better off.",
        "And part of the morality, which is valuing another person's interest like your own, therefore has an objective basis in any social and self-interested group of intelligent agents.",
        "The other is just the logic if intellectual discourse in the first place.",
        "If I'm discussing with you how you ought to behave, if I say you should get off my foot, it's hurting me.",

        "But it's just, in some sense, in the nature of things, in the nature of rationality.",

        "I don't think it's just emotion either.",

        "Can I just say that - but it does seem that with gain theory and with the Golden Rule, even, as being kind of explained from a utilitarian perspective, it does rather undermine the notion of a kind of an ultimate abstract transcendence sort of moral principle being the basis or the foundation for our behavior.",

        "I guess I would have to disagree that ultimately basing it in a kind of reason that I can't wiggle out of and you can't wiggle out off is more persuasive than any kind of religious source, which not only depends on what religion you were born into but ultimately needs its own justification.",
