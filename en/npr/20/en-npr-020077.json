        "Well, I do agree to a certain extent with that but isn't it also in the New Testament that Jesus said he who is without sin let him cast the first stone in the same precept.",
        "Thanks, again, for that Scott.",
        "We're talking with Steve Pinker and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And, Steve, I heard you try to come in on that last thought.",
        "Oh, yes, well, let me say, a wise directive against taking our own sanctimony too seriously, although, Jesus, of course, did accept everything in the Old Testament, he didn't abjure everything and - but I do agree that's a wise counsel.",
        "Let's see if we can get another caller in.",
        "And this is David(ph), David with us from Manhattan in Kansas.",
        "Yes.",
        "What I was wondering is if there is a biological basis to morality then there should be some people who are amoral.",
        "And I was wondering, are there any studies comparing people who are amoral because of some genetic defect to, you know, a moral person and seeing if there's any differences to try to find exactly what is the biological basis of morality?",
        "So, you really do think this is kind of the shopping wave of the future?",
        "You know, I think so.",
        "Because, first of all, for the retailer, this offers lots of avenues for creating a better in-store experience.",
        "These apps can provide additional product information, such as what the product does, what its specifications are, things of that nature.",
        "And it could even provide complementary products that would go along with this product - for instance, an accessory or something of that nature.",
        "So let's imagine that every product in the store had a sign on it that listed all the specifications for the product.",
        "The store would become very cluttered and probably un-shoppable because all it would be filled with would be signs.",
        "Well, now you have another source of information that doesn't have to come from a sales associate; that the retailer can leverage to improve the shopping experience."

        "The people who are often diagnosed as psychopaths or the related condition of anti-social personality disorder seem to fall into that category, they show no empathy, they often show cruelty even from the time they were children.",
        "They bully smaller children and torture animals, they have a great deal of difficulty empathizing and some of them commit heinous acts like bilking elderly people out of their life savings or raping a succession of women.",
        "There are some kinds of people with anti-social personality disorder who do have differences in their brain, in particular, in the parts of the brain that seem to light up when people ponder throwing the fat man over the bridge to stop the runaway trolley.",
        "And although no one has identified a set of genes that contribute to psychopathy and in some cases it's caused by a brain damage rather than by genes.",
        "I suspect that in 10 years' time, there will be a set of genes that are associated with a lack of conscience and in the extreme case an absence of conscience, as we see in psychopaths.",

        "(Reading) Humans often seem unable to weigh life equally in moral situations, for example the uproar over the death of Princess Diana is wildly disproportionate to the hundreds of thousands brutally murdered in Darfur.",
        "I'd like Steve's comments on why people can't recognize this is one life versus hundreds of thousands and the outrage appropriate to the scale of the issue?",
        "And we're going to give you 30 seconds to answer that.",
        "It's a great question.",
        "It partly reflects the fact that authority tends to be moralized and people who have high status and power tend to be given a moral free pass.",
        "It's also the effect of just firsthand experience.",
        "We feel more empathy to individuals that we see and know about than to statistics of hundreds of thousands of people who we don't personally see or form bonds to.",
