        "Well, we hope so.",
        "We're certainly counting on it.",
        "The difficulty with anything to do with renewable energy is that the - all of the problems are so interdisciplinary that you need to cover a wide range of topics in order to make progress.",
        "And how many entries - are they coming in or you're just starting out, you don't have a whole lot to choose from?",
        "Well, right as of now, we have over 50 in the pipeline.",
        "There only a couple up on the public website right now.",
        "But they'll be coming up very quickly in the future.",
        "Let's talk about one of those and that is those miniature organic solar cells in the first issue.",
        "What - tell us what they are and how small they are?",

        "That's right.",
        "Well, this is a very interesting application, affordable to access (ph) that I frankly would have never thought of.",
        "It's, as you said, the use of solar cells to power very small micro-mechanical devices - and probably the most used devices, this type is the accelerometer that's in your car to drive the air bags.",
        "So it senses very rapid deceleration.",
        "And that's a micro electro-mechanical machine.",
        "But of course, it's run off the electrical power of your car.",
        "And this would be a way of actually powering such devices in maybe a hostile environment where you're looking for chemicals in a smokestack or something like that.",
        "So go ahead.",
        "Describe the cell to us.",
        "OK.",
        "Well.",
        "It's a cell that uses organics so it uses polymers mixed with a very small atom - group of atoms of carbon known as carbon-60.",

        "So you have the polymers mixed in with buckyballs.",
        "Right.",
        "And then you can - the light gets absorbed in this material, and it generates electrons and also generates absence of electrons which is holes.",
        "And then these are collected at the opposite electrodes and create and create a current.",
        "And how much current and how much voltage, wattage?",
        "The current is very, very minimal.",
        "A few micro amps is all that's necessary because these devices are very, very small.",
        "The difficulty - and I thought it was very interesting that these people were able to make some progress on it, the difficulty is in voltage.",
        "These devices typically need a very large voltage so order of 10 volts for example.",
        "So - and of course, most of electronic devices work in lower voltages.",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "But you don't need much current so this initial device, I think, produced around eight volts.",
        "And the way they do that is they string the cells in series to increase the voltage.",
        "And so this might be used - I understand that the Department of Defense is invested heavily in this project and see it as - there's a lot of sunlight over there where we have the military.",
        "And why not take advantage of it?",
        "Well, that's right, and they're interested in larger areas, but they're interested in flexible substances so you can wear it on your clothes and things of that sort.",
        "So you can go out in the field and powering, you know, I guess will be the uniform of tomorrow or actually of today because we know batteries are great premium over where we were five..."

        "That depends on whether or not we can get enough under writers on our site, people who care about renewable energy, companies that care about renewable energy.",
