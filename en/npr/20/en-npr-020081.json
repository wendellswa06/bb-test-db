        "Yeah.",
        "Why do airlines overbook and why does the system allow them to schedule more flights than apparently the system can handle?",
        "Simple reason.",
        "Airlines are desperate for revenue and they're desperate for profits.",
        "You have to remember that this airline, if you go back to the first flight by the Wright brothers, and took all the profits that the airlines made over the next 50, 60, 70 years, and then you add in what the airlines lost since the year 2000, this is an industry that has collectively lost money.",

        "They're desperate, they overbook.",
        "It depends by flight, it depends by time of day, but it is unusual on busy route to see an airline overbook habitually by three, four, five percent.",
        "And yeah - and the reason they do it is because right now the penalties for overbooking, if they do bump you, are fairly modest, just a couple of hundred dollars.",
        "And if they can bump you and add on a late-paying business traveler, who's willing to pay $800, $900 for that same seat, it's a business decision they're willing to make.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And the system of, you know, just simply - well, I guess, you answered that.",
        "It's to look for profits and you're right.",
        "A lot of these companies were in serious trouble not so very long ago.",
        "Some of the problem, though, is technological.",

        "Right now, the air industry is working off of 1950s Ozzie and Harriet-generation radar system that worked in that era.",
        "But you know, last year, the industry flew 750 million passengers.",
        "And the problem is that radar, it - there are 22 different centers around the country that the FAA mans with air traffic controllers, who are following radar.",
        "And so, what that means is that airlines can't fly point-to-point, they can't randomly fly them, what they think is the most efficient route.",
        "They have to fly within the certain lengths.",
        "Imagine an interstate highway system in the skies, and they have to fly on those mandated highways, because they have to fly within a certain range of each of those - one of those 22 air traffic control centers.",
        "And, you know, that's very inefficient in this day and age.",
        "The solution is to move to a satellite-based system, a GPS system, where you could have the planes monitored by satellite.",
        "Right now, because this radar system is very inefficient, I mean, it can take as long as 22 seconds for one air traffic controller to hand off a plane to the next controller.",
        "So, they're very conservative.",
        "They space out planes, generally about at least five miles apart.",
        "With the GPS system, you can fly planes much closer, you could land them closer with less spacing and as a result, you could get a lot more planes up in the air, and you could land them quicker.",
        "Surprisingly not, surprisingly not.",
