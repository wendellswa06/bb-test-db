        "And is it only anger over wages why employees are angry at their airlines?",
        "Oh, no. It's far more than anger over wages.",
        "And I'd say it's far more complex than anger.",
        "The pilots, flight attendants, everyone else at the airlines that have been through reorganization, have seen not just the take-home pay cut, but the pensions cut or cancelled and turned over to the federal government.",
        "At the same time, they're working longer hours for considerably less pay.",
        "And as Dean said, it's not just the pilots who probably can afford it, but it's flight attendants, it's baggage tossers, it's the nice, harassed lady behind the counter.",
        "And, yeah, some of these folks are all making $18,000, $19,000 a year and there's no pension.",
        "And it creates a culture of imbitterment, particularly if you're going to be dealing with angry people.",
        "You know, you work for United Airlines, which was in bankruptcy for almost three years, and you took a 30 percent pay cut and your working 10 percent more hours and you got no pension.",
        "And when you go the airport in the morning, the first thing that happens is an angry customer who doesn't trust you because the customer knows that the flights are usually like this, seen all the stories, listened to radio shows like this.",
        "Customer comes in.",
        "He's suspicious.",
        "He wants to fight with you, the people on the airplane are angry and want to fight with you, and you you're not making any money.",
        "Sure, it's more than anger.",
        "It's a deep bitterness and I think it's going to take years for that kind of bitterness and mistrust to go away.",
        "Is management trying to do things to help their employees cope with this situation?",
        "Not really.",
        "There are a few steps here and there, employee involvement teams and so on.",
        "Northwest Airlines, which has had some of the most troubled labor relations, is actually trying to do things about it by getting employees more involved in scheduling and so on.",
        "But, by and large, right now, the airlines are just trying to get through this summer from hell.",
        "And maybe, when things slow down in the autumn, there'll be - they'll have the time to catch their breath and think about doing something.",
        "Right.",
        "And only making matters worse is the management teams of some these airlines have been enriching themselves with bonuses for bringing an airline out of bankruptcy.",
        "The executive teams - or helping them navigate the industry storm, the executive teams at Northwest and American recently rewarded themselves with very large bonuses.",
        "And that only set off the workers that those - and the pilots of those airlines even more.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Northwest and American gave themselves bonuses.",
        "They weren't that extreme.",
        "The one place I think you're justified in pointing a finger is at United, where Glen Tilton, the former oil company executive is getting double digit millions for having taken the airlines through bankruptcy."

        "And, yeah, it is available.",
        "It is used.",
        "You know, I think the big, you know, the biggest problem is the hub model that the airlines are using.",
        "They're, you know, trying to get too many flights into too few airports, you know, all at the same time.",
        "And inevitably, that ends up creating delays, creating problems.",
        "You know, you got a situation where, you know, airlines are, you know, sitting at the gate and they've got to pull out and get in line so that they can get their place in the system.",
        "And when there's that many plane sitting on the tarmac, you're going to inevitably have delays.",

        "But, yeah, the hub airports are very much part of the problem.",
        "And I think it's really going to be a little bit unrealistic to expect the airlines to move away from the hub and spoke model.",
        "I think one of the issues is going to be forcing aviation, forcing airlines to moderate their use of certain overused airports.",
        "I, mainly, mean by this, the airports in the New York City area, and specifically La Guardia.",
        "New York City airports are the worst in the nation for delays.",
        "Their delays ripple up and down the coast from Boston to Florida, from the Atlantic Ocean all the way to the Mississippi.",
        "They are one of the reasons why we're slowing down.",
        "And one of the reasons why we're slowing down is La Guardia has routinely, chronically three and four-hour runway delays, because it has overscheduled, because the FAA has failed to regulate traffic there.",

        "I think without the hub and spoke, you would loose a lot of service to second and third tier cities like Chattanooga, Tennessee or Huntsville, Alabama.",
        "I think one of the real problems we're seeing right now is that, in the past five, six years, as the airlines have tried to get their footing again, they have actually stopped using as many big jets.",

        "At JFK, the average flight coming in, taking off and landing at JFK only has about 80 seats, 90 seats.",
        "And JFK officials have gone to the airlines and said, you know - talked about creating a minimum size requirement, a 100, 120 seats.",
        "But the truth is, the airlines don't want to do that because it's cheaper for them to fly the regional jets.",
        "And passengers don't want that as well because we love - smaller planes mean more frequency, so you can fly every hour.",

        "in the spring of 2000.",
