        "We heard that New York is the most congested air space in the nation right now.",
        "That's absolutely true.",
        "But there are a lot of operational directions that can be taken that will solve a lot of the problems in New York.",
        "Kennedy has four runways.",
        "We only use two at a time.",
        "Now, that's not the case in almost any other major airport in the country today.",
        "But traditionally, we've only used two.",
        "Newark, same situation.",
        "There are three runways.",
        "We're only using two.",
        "It's a lot more difficult and a lot tougher to use more intersecting runways, but it can be done and it can increase the capacity of those airports.",
        "The next thing that can happen is airspace redesign in New York.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "That's been held up by the politicians for years.",
        "And yet, everybody acknowledges we need to have airspace redesigned because there are some 25 different airports in the New York Metropolitan-Connecticut area that are feeding into that system.",
        "We need to make some very fundamental changes to the way we do business.",
        "And I think it has to be done on a very cooperative basis with the air traffic controllers, with commercial, with private, and others, to get the job done.",
        "Let me turn to Dean Foust of Business Week.",
        "We're hearing James May say look, a lot of these problems are based on the government, basically.",
        "I think he's got a point and there are some experts who believe that we should move to - that the FAA is not up to the task.",
        "We're talking about the GPS system, which is called NextGen.",
        "This is not the first time the FAA has taken a stab at modernizing the radar base system.",
        "They tried back in the '80s, and it didn't work.",
        "You know, there are other countries like Canada and Australia and Switzerland that have basically created a private-for-profit organization to effectively do the task that the FAA is doing now, arguing that a private organization can do a better job.",
        "They make the analogy to the stock exchanges.",
        "What would our stock - what would the stock exchanges in the U.S.",
        "be like if they were run by the federal government, and that a private organization can do the job better.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "The question I have, however, is the political will to really tackle some of these issues.",
        "Talk about we're not using runways efficiently, we're not managing the airspace in the New York to Philadelphia and Washington corridor.",
        "You know, my sense is that there's a lot of public outcry about some of these changes.",
        "Because when - at JFK, when you start rerouting how flights come in and land and where they fly, you're getting a lot of community opposition from people who suddenly, you know, hear plane noise all day long.",
        "Or, you still live in Queens, that you could count the rivets on some of those planes coming into the airport.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, another example is L.A.",
        "I mean, L.A.",
        "badly - L.A.",
        "International badly needs more runways.",
        "But the people in the surrounding areas don't want it and, you know, in the recent election, all the mayoral candidates said I do not support adding runways to L.A.",
        "International.",
        "And that is fundamentally the problem that we've got, is that everybody recognizes the importance, but it's a NIMBY - not in my backyard…"

        "Information is - let me turn to Dean Foust on this, it is the most frustrating thing to be waiting on a plane or at a, you know, holding area in an airport and feeling that the airline must know and they're just not telling you or they're not telling you the truth.",
        "I agree that information could go - better information could go a long way to making passengers feel better.",
        "As I mentioned earlier, I think that airlines should be required on the ticketing sites, reservations sites to report the on-time record of each and every flight.",
        "I do think - airlines need to do a better job of providing passengers with an update.",
        "They need to do a better job of giving higher, more money in refunds or payments for passengers that are bumped.",

        "And James May, just before the break, Dean Foust asked, you know, should there be a cap - two hours on the tarmac, the pilot must return to the city airport terminal?",
        "Short answer - no, there shouldn't be a cap.",
        "The decision should be left in the hands of the FAA and the pilot in command.",
        "I think the real Catch-22 that most passengers find themselves in is that they want to complete their flight.",
        "So does the airline.",
