        "I sat on the tarmac for two hours.",
        "And at about 2:10, 2:20, we finally got clearance because there was a thunderstorm sitting right on the top of LaGuardia.",
        "Now, the real issue was making sure that we had information.",
        "We had - we knew what was going on.",
        "The pilots did a terrific job of keeping us posted to the extent that the FAA would tell them what was going on.",
        "But it was weather related as the vast majority of the delays are.",
        "And, you know, what we would prefer to do is say, all right, at a certain level - and I think all of our carriers have put processes in place - let's begin to assess when we're going to turn this flight around and when we're going to make a final go, no-go decision.",

        "But recognize that when we do that, it almost always will result in some form of cancellation.",

        "They employees gave to keep these companies a business and we can't even be proud of the service we provide.",

        "What are the industry's specific plan to improve service to the level that customers will pay an amount that allows the industry to become safely profitable?",
        "And how exactly are our employees to be rewarded equal to their sacrifices?",
        "And finally, Jim, have you ever stopped to consider that if airline managements treated the workers like other new economy companies, then maybe we wouldn't need a strike committee after all?",
        "Frankly, I think the pilots have said enough is enough.",
        "Okay, Mike.",
        "Let's get a response from James May.",
        "As Mike knows, I can't give a specific answer to a lot of those questions.",
        "I think that based on my conversations with our CEOs, they all recognize that they've got real work to do to reestablish, reconnect with their employee base.",
        "I think all of them were doing that, and engaging in efforts.",
        "I've seen them questioned on, you know, Doug Steenland just the other day on \"\"The Today Show,\"\" for instance.",
        "And we understand there's a real issue.",
        "The bad news is that, there have been a lot of cuts.",
        "The bad news is that, you know, a lot of people have had to make sacrifice.",
        "The good news is that those carriers emerged from bankruptcy.",
        "They did so in a much healthier fashion than they were there before.",
        "So a lot of jobs were saved in that process.",
        "And I think there has to be a balance of recognition for that as well.",
        "What about his point, though, of maybe - what could airlines do to improve services to the point where people would be willing to pay a little bit more and increase profits, so people could start making better money?",
        "Believe me, there is no motivation like the profit motivation for carriers or any other business in America.",
        "And I'm confident that all of the individual carriers have plans to try and increase their profitability and their relationships with their workers across the board.",
        "Mike, I'm not sure you're going to be happy with those answers, but that's all we've got for you.",
        "No, Neal, but at least we got to point out there that the employees are the ones that sacrificed for these companies, and the employees should be rewarded when the company's turning in the profit, not the CEOs.",
        "There's only a few individuals right now that are profiting.",
        "And the CEOs need to wake up and understand that in a service industry, the employees deal with the customers on a daily basis and the pilots who fly those airplanes need to be treated with respect and dignity.",
        "And so do the passengers, Mike.",
        "So do the passengers.",
        "Thanks very much."

        "Hi.",
        "I'm also a captain for a major carrier.",
        "And the two most common comments I really had was, you know, we do inform our passengers, but if you go back to the gate, a lot of times the FAA - you'll lose your slot for takeoff.",
        "So even though you're out there for three hours, you go back to the gate, you may have to wait another six or seven hours before your takeoff opportunity.",
        "And you have these passengers who are demanding, you know, champagne service, but they're the paying the same, if not less, than they were 25 years ago to the same seat on the airplane.",
        "I hear your point, but, really, champagne service, it's diet coke at best.",
        "Not even.",
        "But you know, but you pay 40 bucks for a Fort Lauderdale to New York ticket and you expect to be treated the first-class, you know, service.",
        "And the fares do have to come up with the salaries and the benefits for the employees, it's best for the service you want.",
        "I think a point we should make here is that, we've spent the time beating up on airlines, and beating up on airline management.",
        "And I think passengers and consumers, we bear a little bit of the blame here, as the cartoon character, Pogo, said, we've met the enemy and he is us.",
        "I still am a no unless the bill is dramatically changed.",
        "Look, as passengers, we don't want to pay more than $200 for a flight.",
        "That puts pressure on the airlines to jam as many people in, to overbook, et cetera, to fly smaller, cheaper planes.",
        "And at the same time, we only want to fly in certain parts of the day.",
        "You know, people talk about creating congestion pricing so that flights that take off during primetime hours say, 5:30 to 8:30 p.m., passengers will be required to pay more and thus, it would create an incentive to spread out the flights more evenly through the day, and address this congestion.",
        "But I'm a business traveler.",
        "I like to fly at 7:30 or 8:00, because I can put in a full workday.",
        "You know, if I fly in the morning, I want to fly at 7:30 or 8:00 in the morning.",
        "I don't want to fly at 1:00 p.m. And, you know, most passengers take the same approach that, if we can't - if Delta can't give us that 7:30 flight here in Atlanta, I'll look at AirTran or I'll look at a connecting flight.",
