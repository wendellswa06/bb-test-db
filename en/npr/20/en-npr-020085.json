        "While I was traveling, I was talking back and forth with Martin and, at one point, he did tell me, like, `Oh, there has been an explosion on a bus.",
        "I mean, that was after I'd already been on the bus for about 40 minutes, on different buses, and he's like, `You know, I just think you should just walk.'",
        "That the advice to bus riders came from family and friends watching the news on TV, not from officials, will no doubt be well-examined in the upcoming days.",
        "All of the attacks in the West attributed to al-Qaeda have followed a pattern of multiple parts of the transportation system being hit in quick succession.",
        "Four planes were hijacked in America, four trains attacked in Madrid, and in London, three trains and one bus.",
        "Frances Edwards-Winslow is the director of emergency services for the city of San Jose, California, and co-author of numerous reports advising cities on the best practices for terrorism preparedness.",
        "With al-Qaeda, their model seems to be multiple attacks within a very short period of time.",
        "That still doesn't suggest that the default emergency plan should be that the first thing that happens, you shut everything down, because, unfortunately, we have pranks and pipe bombs and small explosive devices that go off in the United States from time to time on a not irregular basis.",
        "And if we stopped all trains at every time one of them was found or every time we had some small explosive device go off, the level of disruption would become fantastic.",
        "In March of 2004, New York, using a US Department of Homeland Security grant, drilled for a subway attack.",
        "Officials concocted a scenario of multiple subterranean explosions which would result in 40 deaths and hundreds of casualties in the subways, circumstances remarkably similar to what actually happened in London.",
        "But what couldn't be simulated was the panic and uncertainty of a real attack.",
        "Plus, there is no single pattern to train for.",
        "In Madrid, for instance, all the attacks happened within a two-minute period.",
        "Yesterday, the explosions occurred over 56 minutes.",
        "Still, Frances Edwards-Winslow says training responders and transit workers helps, as evidenced by reports from London of orange-vested conductors leading passengers off mangled subway cars.",
        "The last part of this equation is for the public to train itself.",
        "Beyond the ubiquitous warning from officials to be aware of your surroundings, Edwards-Winslow offers these specifics for subway riders.",
        "There are clearly marked exits and they're painted with glow-in-the-dark paint, and there are windows that clearly have indicators that this window can be removed in an emergency.",
        "But I would bet you that even though it's very clearly marked and the people see it every day--I mean, you can't miss it because it's Day-Glo yellow paint--I wonder how many people pay attention.",
        "A bill before Congress proposes a $50 million cut in funding for security upgrades to local transit agencies.",
        "Experts say in order to lessen the vulnerability of mass transportation, it is the masses themselves who must become more responsible for their surroundings.",

        "With Obama in the White House, you'd get a tax increase of about $300,000.",
        "That means depending on who's in the White House, you could have a million dollar swing in your tax bill.",
        "Wow.",
        "And that's just taking all different kinds of taxes into account, whether it's income taxes, anything else.",
        "And including corporate taxes.",
        "McCain is going to cut the corporate tax rate.",
        "Most of that redounds to the benefit of well-off people, and that's included in that number that we just talked about.",

        "What about people who consider themselves middle class?",
        "Well, let's talk about people between $40,000 and $70,000 a year - right in the middle of the income distribution.",
        "Things aren't quite so stark there.",
        "Under Obama you'd get a tax cut of about $2,100; under McCain your tax cut would be about $1,400."

        "Well, both of them claim that they are going to finance them by finding places to cut the budget.",
        "But the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that has analyzed these tax proposals, says that both of them would indeed increase the national debt.",
        "Now, let's pull ourselves out of the details here.",
        "What is the big idea that seems to animate each of these candidates as he considers his tax policies?",
        "Well, for Senator McCain the big idea is a Republican idea going back to Ronald Reagan, and that is to boost growth, and you can hear it in his rhetoric.",
