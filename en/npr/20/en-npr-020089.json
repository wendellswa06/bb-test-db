        "Depending on the plan that is adopted, it may not be possible to cover everyone.",

        "Congressman Gottheimer, what's your North Star when it comes to this issue?",

        "And so yesterday, we had a very good meeting with 20 or so members of Congress sitting around a table talking about if the Senate bill fails, how do we actually do what should have been done in the beginning, which is work together to fix the ACA and to make it better and to improve health care?",
        "And I think what I heard around the table, which was really - I'll tell you, the kind of meeting that we should be having which is instead of starting with a position of no, saying OK, there are things to fix.",

        "Or is this just something you feel Republicans had to just go through?",
        "Well, I think when we started the process this session, I think it became obvious it was going to be a Democrat-Republican divide, shirt-skins type of approach to it.",
        "And obviously, I don't come from that school of thought.",
        "I try to find areas where we can find common ground and advance a legislative agenda where you've got Democrats, Republicans working together because if you look historically, if the Affordable Care Act had done - and maybe start there - had been done with Democrat, Republican input coming up with a solution for health care, maybe we'd be in a different situation today.",
