        "She had testified that another officer told her Gray said he couldn't breathe while he was in the transport van.",
        "The officer denied that.",
        "The judge deemed it hearsay.",

        "Witnesses in two previous trials testified that a van driver bears ultimate responsibility for a detainee.",
        "Prosecutors may also try to prove that Goodson gave Gray a rough ride, deliberately driving in a dangerous way, though it's not clear there's evidence of that.",
        "I don't know if he will get convicted.",
        "I don't know if he should get convicted.",
        "But if anybody's going to get convicted, it'll be him.",
        "If Goodson is not convicted, Moskos and others wonder if the state's attorney might drop charges against the other officers or if the city would again explode in violent protests, like those after Gray's death.",
        "This Freddie Gray trial, to the average Baltimorean, really does not mean a lot at all.",

        "Of course the Freddie Gray trials are important, Bahar says, but more pressing for many is gun violence, which has grown steadily worse over the past year, and the daily struggle to survive, which has not grown easier.",
        "Whichever way the trial goes does not affect somebody's ability to pay their bills and provide food for their children.",

        "That's a movement associated with white nationalism.",

        "Here's an excerpt.",

        "We're at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict of which if the people in this room and the people in the church do not bind together and really form what I feel is a aspect of the Church militant to really be able to not just stand with our beliefs, but to fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that's starting.",
        "A barbarity, Bannon added, that will completely eradicate everything that has been bequeathed over the last 2,500 years and which he spelled out clearly a few minutes later.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "We are in an outright war against jihadists, Islamic fascism.",
        "And this war is I think metastasizing almost far quicker than governments can handle it.",
        "Sylvia, to put it mildly, this doesn't sound like the kind of language we associate with Pope Francis.",
        "No, absolutely not.",
        "Francis has repeatedly urged European countries to welcome migrants who are in the majority Muslim.",
        "And he's always championed the rights of the poor.",
        "A year ago Francis criticized candidate Donald Trump for wanting to build a wall along the Mexican border, saying a person who thinks only about building walls and not building bridges is not Christian.",
        "But that's not Bannon's world view, apparently."
