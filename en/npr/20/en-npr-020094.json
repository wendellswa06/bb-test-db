        "And they say this has emboldened his critics within and outside the Vatican, and they've become much more vocal.",
        "For example, just last week there were these mysterious anti-Francis posters cropping up all over Rome.",
        "The photo showed the pope uncharacteristically grouchy.",

        "One Kurd spoke of progress, although he said it was slow, and he also said that there were a lot of problems that still have to be solved.",
        "We spoke to a Shiite who said that everything was sorted out except for one issue, and that was the issue of distributing the national revenues.",
        "And then we spoke to a Sunni who said there were profound differences, and he said that if they were to meet the deadline they'd need a magic wand because there was no other way that he could conceive of that it would be done in time.",

        "But the negotiating process is also beginning to sort of seep out onto the street.",

        "It's beginning to take place by using the crowd on the street.",
        "The three issues reportedly at the center of the deadlock are, as you mention, of course, federalism and the desire for some groups to have greater autonomy; the role of Islam, Sharia, in the new government; and the sharing of oil revenue.",
        "Any indication that progress in any one of these issues might kind of raise the tide so that all three issues could be brought together?",
        "Well, there's one report today suggesting that they have agreed to make the--all issues interdependent.",
        "In other words, you get an agreement on one and you have to have an agreement on all.",
        "You can't simply agree on one aspect and then renegotiate the others.",
        "So they'll all be tied together.",
