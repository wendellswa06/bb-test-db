        "But the last few days, of course, the focus has really been on the Intelligence Committee.",
        "And the expectation is that that committee will work carefully but expeditiously over the next several weeks to collect additional evidence and prepare to make a set of findings in a report that I expect will be referred to the Judiciary Committee.",

        "The president has engaged in very serious wrongdoing, has betrayed his oath of office and undermined the national security of our country.",

        "The media, which has not been citing sources, has been revealing a lot of the details that the government doesn't.",
        "For example Suddeutsche Zeitung, which is a large newspaper in southern Germany, is saying that the suspect was - who was under investigation worked at the Defense Ministry.",

        "Now, is this investigation related to the earlier case of the alleged spy last week?",
        "It does not appear so, although Spiegel online is reporting that the latest suspect had aroused the suspicion of German authorities because he had close ties to alleged U.S.",
        "spies, and therefore had been under observation for a while.",
        "OK, now remind us again of what the first case was all about.",
        "Well, that suspect who was arrested is reported to be a German foreign intelligence agent who is accused of selling 218 documents to the CIA - some of them related to an investigation by the parliamentary committee that's looking into American spying in Germany.",
        "He was apparently caught when he made an offer to the Russians via e-mail to sell them information.",

        "Well, certainly a day after the great soccer game against Brazil, people were not very happy here.",
        "The government has been relatively cautious about saying anything while these cases are being investigated.",
        "Chancellor Angela Merkel would only say that there are talks being held, and her spokesman said that this - these sorts of allegations strike at the trust between the two countries.",
        "But the German Foreign Ministry made a pretty loud statement when they summoned the American ambassador on Friday in relation to the first case.",
        "And Ambassador John B.",
        "Emerson was at the Foreign Ministry again today, although the U.S.",
