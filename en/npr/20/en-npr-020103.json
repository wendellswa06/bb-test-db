        "But clearly, there were people who lived here before the railroad, before that land auction.",
        "Well, there were Native Americans here, especially Paiutes, for, of course, a couple of thousand years, but the original settlers, if you will, of the valley were Mormons.",
        "Brigham Young sent missionaries here in 1855.",
        "They built a little fort/mission.",
        "And his idea was pretty similar to why people had been coming here before and why people would come here afterward, which was a safe haven.",
        "Mormons had a history of being shot at and killed, and he wanted Mormons who were traveling from Salt Lake to San Bernardino to be able to stop off somewhere safe.",
        "He also wanted, of course, to proselytize with the Native Americans here, teach them farming techniques, so they set up a mission, and the mission came apart within a couple of years, partly over divisions over whether they were going to be mining or really out there christianizing.",
        "Part of the problem, frankly--I had an old professor at UNLV, Ralph Roske, who used to say that the most important person in the history of Las Vegas was not Bugsy Siegel.",
        "It was Willis Carrier, because if he hadn't invented the air conditioner, we wouldn't be here.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And the poor Mormons, after a couple of years, they were sunburned enough.",
        "So they left, and for the next just about half a century, it was a couple of ranching families that dominated the valley.",
        "And the 1900 Census showed a population of about 30, and some of those signatures looked alike."

        "Workers were not paid in scrip, but the railroad certainly was the dominant employer.",
        "Everybody kind of worked on railroad time.",
        "It was a 24-hour town from the beginning, because if the train was coming through, the passengers needed something to do while the train was being repaired.",
        "So a lot of people either worked for the railroad or depended on it.",
        "And, you know, most people don't think of Las Vegas as being a small community with people building churches and building schools, but basically, they were trying to start a little town in the West, and they also were promoters even then.",
        "There's no evidence that anybody in 1905 said, `What happens here stays here,' but they were promoting the town as, of all things, a mining and agricultural center.",
        "Well, they had water, so they could logically argue for agriculture, and this is Nevada, the Silver State.",
