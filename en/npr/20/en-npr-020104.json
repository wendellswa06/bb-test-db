        "He was working in Los Angeles in 1905, and he and his buddy read the ad in the Los Angeles Times that they were opening up a new town in Las Vegas, and they were auctioning off lots, and you could take a round-trip to Las Vegas and stay overnight for $23 or whatever it was, and so they thought, well, that'd be a good, nice couple of days.",
        "You go up there and see what was happening.",
        "And the second day, they made an offer to sell the lots at a discount and with a small down payment.",
        "The original purchase was on South Main Street in about the 500 block, they bought two or perhaps four little 25-foot lots, or at least made the down payments on them, and that's where they started their business.",

        "My father had a small retail business here in Las Vegas, but he had a smaller store in Boulder City, and because of this, he was allowed to go into Boulder City, because they had gates on their only road out there, and you had to go through security to get into Boulder City.",
        "And so because of the store, he would go out there quite frequently, and he used to take my sister and myself with him, and the fellow that ran the store, he and his wife lived in the back of the store, and he was a security guard at the construction site, so he would tell my dad what areas were available, and so we used to go down and watch them do the work.",
        "We would see the big, huge trucks.",
        "We'd see the cableway coming across and dropping down the cement and sometimes the men would go out on the cableway.",
        "They would go in like a big, huge basket.",
        "They would take 30 or 40 men, and I've seen that going on.",
        "And the thing that was probably most unique about my experience was that they had to build cofferdams to dry up the dam construction area.",
        "And so for several years, it was all dry, but when they got time to let the water start coming in, they'd been diverting the water through tunnels, diversion tunnels that had been created in the sides of the canyon.",
        "That was a tremendous project in itself.",
        "But the water had been diverted and then it came time, the dam was ready to meet the test of having water come up against the face of the dam.",
        "So not too long--just about a week before the water got up high enough, they closed off the diversion tunnels and then, of course, the water began to rise on the upstream side.",
        "And so my dad drove his car clear down in the bottom o--next to the upstream side of the dam, and my sister and I got out of the car and went over and touched the bottom of the dam, which is now roughly about 600 feet underwater.",
        "Wow.",
        "You mentioned Boulder City.",
        "It was known originally as Boulder Dam.",
        "How did it get renamed for arguably the most unpopular president of the 20th century?",

        "Which do you think was most important to the growth of Las Vegas, Hoover Dam or the Basic Magnesium plant that was built a few years later in Henderson?",
        "Well, why don't we get Michael Green to help us answer that.",
        "Oh, it is kind of a chicken or egg question.",
        "But since the dam came first, I think we have to go with the dam, just because it led to the first population spurt.",
        "The other thing that the dam did that really nobody expected was that it became a tourist attraction.",
        "Hundreds of thousands of people were coming here to look at this eighth wonder of the world and the Boulder City area was a federal reservation, and they banned everything that tourists like to do.",
        "The workers couldn't even do it.",
        "So Las Vegas was just up the road, so they'd come here.",
        "Basic magnesium is crucial, no question, and it does build the town of Henderson, which, like Las Vegas, is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country.",
