        "But there were a lot of great people here.",
        "There weren't a lot of people, but out of that percentage, there was a goodly number.",
        "One of them is sitting here in the audience, Thalia Dondero and her husband, Harvey, who was an administrator at the school district; Edith Katz and her husband, Lloyd, and Ruthie Deskin, whom we lost last year, and her husband, who was a sportswriter.",
        "Again, we think of the mobsters, we think of the great entrepreneurs.",
        "We don't think of the people who built the civic structures of this town.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Because these were three couples that, at the NAACP, whatever they promoted, whatever they were doing, fund-raising, whatever, these were the three couples that supported us heartily, physically and financially, and I had the privilege of honoring the widows--all three of them were widows at the time--well, it's been a few years ago--because of their contribution to the--what really happened was that we finally got public accommodations and fair housing and we passed a civil rights law before the 1964 civil rights law.",
        "And a great deal of credit should go to those white people.",
        "And as a matter of fact, if it weren't for good white people in the world, we might still be in slavery.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Alice Key is with us here in the audience on the panel as we're broadcasting live from the Desert Research Institute in Las Vegas, Nevada.",

        "Do you...",
        "It was a black show.",

        "Clarence Robinson, who was the producer of the Cotton Club shows in New York, bought the show out--the first Moulin Rouge show out, and it was an all-black show.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Michael Green?",
        "That, and you found a lot of white entertainers coming to the Moulin Rouge after their shows were over.",
        "Oh, not only entertainers.",
        "You could have shot a cannon through the casinos and the hotels on the Strip, which there were about five or six at that time, and at 2:00 in the morning and wouldn't hit--you wouldn't hit anybody because they were all over there at the Moulin Rouge watching that show and gaming.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "All right, here's an e-mail question we have from Peter in North Beach: `When I first visited Las Vegas, I was surprised to find a large and thriving China Town.",
        "What's the history of Las Vegas' China Town, and how did Chinese immigrants arrive there?",
        "Michael?",
        "And here it is again.",
        "See if you can hear the difference.",
        "As crazy as this is going to sound, we built the China Town Plaza, then we got more immigrants.",
        "The tradition with the China Town, it's a story of segregation, whether it's New York or San Francisco, and there were Asian residents in the vicinity of the China Town Plaza, which is a couple of miles west of the Strip, but some businessmen came here in the mid-90s and built the China Town Plaza and had markets and restaurants and the like, and then more Asian immigrants started moving in there.",
        "So if Las Vegas has a tradition of doing things in a strange way, we managed to invent the China Town backwards.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Hmm.",
        "And let's get another caller on the line, and if I remember to push the right button, this is Kate, Kate in Charlotte, North Carolina."

        "Michael.",
        "Well, the--what made the Flamingo so different on the Strip is that the first two hotels built on the Strip were sort of the classic Southwestern ranch-style low rises, and the Flamingo was a low rise, but Siegel and Billy Wilkerson, who was also one of the original builders, their vision was to build a kind of suburban, classy, luxury resort for the Hollywood crowd.",
        "There's some Miami Beach influence there as well.",
        "So the Flamingo isn't necessarily new to American architecture, but it was different for Las Vegas.",
        "Different for Las Vegas.",
        "And when did the first high rises start to go up?",
        "The first high rise on the Strip was the Riviera, which is celebrating its 50th birthday this year.",
        "It was built in '55.",
        "It was nine stories, and people just couldn't believe it.",
