        "I'm a native of Las Vegas--former native of Las Vegas, and Chinese-America, and so I grew up in Las Vegas, and I just wanted to share that my experience was one of sort of being a token, because I was always just the only Asian-American in the class from elementary school all the way up to high school.",
        "I know someone wrote in an e-mail about the China Town.",
        "I wanted to know if Michael Green could comment, though, on--there was an older part of China Town, or an old China Town in Las Vegas around Charleston, East Charleston, Fong's Garden.",
        "I don't know if he could comment on that or not.",
        "Michael?",
        "Yes, there are several Chinese restaurants, markets in that part of town, and East Charleston's one of the older sections, building up in especially the '40s.",
        "And Fong's Garden, I believe, was Wing Fong, who went on to be involved in banking.",

        "And it--the Chinese community here traditionally was small, but some of the members of the community have been very influential in our development.",
        "Even reading back on some of the history of Las Vegas in preparation for this program, Chinese families were amongst the earliest here after 1905, Japanese as well, as well as African-Americans, of course.",
        "Yes.",
        "This was a mostly white town at the outset, but from the beginning there is an ethnic mix.",
        "It's not exactly a melting pot, but it's close, and sadly there was a lot of segregation, not just of African-Americans, but of other groups.",
        "They tended to be shunted to one side of the town site, trying to keep them out the way.",
        "But you find early on Las Vegas, Chinese restaurants, Mexican restaurants, some markets.",
        "There's a small ethnic community here from the beginning.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And, Neal?",
        "Yes, Beth.",
        "Can I make one more comment?",
        "Actually my family moved to Las Vegas originally because my father worked for the test site, so kind of segueing into the atomic issue you were going to talk about, he was a scientist with the Department of Energy for many years."

        "But what--I am a member of the Order of the Tortoise, which was--and I've been here since 1943, so I just had to ask if you knew what it was like to be sure you were awake in time before they dropped the bomb and to open the windows and the doors, because they'd break the windows or rattle your house, and everything would be like daylight, and then that would pass.",
        "But then in some of the information that was released, they said that the fallout might be a great inconvenience, so I just kind of wondered, you know, those are kind of the days that...",

        "Yes, that's correct.",
        "I was sent by the United States Army out to the test site from Ft.",
        "Sill, Oklahoma, and we were sent primarily to test the atomic cannon; however, they were doing a lot of testing at the time.",
        "We were there for about six weeks, and we witnessed two other tests while I was there, and of course, I was about roughly 18 miles away from ground zero, and we had to turn around and cover our eyes while the initial explosion took place, but then you'd turn around and watch the fireball and the mushroom cloud.",
        "I might say, too, though, that on one of these tests just two days later, we were volunteers, but we got in the bus and they had, of course, checked out the target area with--the radioactive safety engineers had been through the area, and we were taken down within two miles of ground zero to observe the damage that had been done.",
        "In those days they--in the target area that would put all sorts of military equipment, buildings and things of that order.",
        "So I felt that the scientists had reduced the residual radioactivity considerably, otherwise we wouldn't have been down there two miles away from ground zero.",

        "Well, just before we formally switch to the subject of atomic testing, let me remind you that there are some stories--other stories that we're following here today at NPR News, and here are some of the headlines.",
        "Senator George Voinovich has agreed to send John Bolton's nomination to be UN ambassador to the Senate floor where he said he would vote against him.",
        "The Ohio Republican said he'll join Democrats in voting against Bolton in committee.",
        "And virtually every GOP member since 1989 has taken money from Tom DeLay.",

        "He said he would tear up NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and be quick to tax imports if trading partners misbehaved.",
        "Lori Wallach of Public Citizen, who's a longtime liberal opponent of trade agreements like NAFTA, says Trump's nominee, Robert Lighthizer, also has a healthy skepticism about the free-trade doctrine.",
        "What has always set him apart from other Republican trade experts is that he has never really been based on ideology or theory but rather the actual outcomes of different policies.",
        "Outcomes, says Wallach, that protected American companies and workers.",
        "In the 1980s, Lighthizer was a deputy U.S.",
        "trade representative under Ronald Reagan.",

        "So it was really never about substance.",
        "It was about a style of politics and the Republicans who really want to champion this just want a confrontational style for confrontation's sake.",

        "And their view was the last time the Tea Party was on the march, they had just won the election, they were genuinely scared that the Republicans would go over the edge.",
        "But I think their behavior now says that if they don't think they made a mistake, they sure don't want to make that mistake again.",
        "And so - and that they feel that if the Republicans misread them, misread the firm position they have based on the last time around, it'll be very bad for the country.",
        "So they're sending out kinds of signals, including in that meeting with the leaders this week, that the president is dead serious about not negotiating on the procedural issues and having a negotiation later on on everything else.",

        "And I think they've decided, probably intelligently, that there's not going to be a lot of legislation passed over the next couple years, but at least they can do real damage to the Republican Party by letting the Republican - by inviting confrontation with more Republican radicals.",
        "And I think that's going to happen on immigration reform, and it's happening this week.",
        "And so, if I were a Democrat, that's probably what I'd be doing.",
        "I'd say our goal over the next few years is help the Republicans commit suicide and hope moderates and responsible Republicans don't leap to the fore, and we'll see if that happens.",
        "Could I just say quickly, they also think - obviously the Republicans are damaging themselves, and that doesn't bother Democrats - but they also think that it would establish terrible precedence for some time to come if we routinely govern ourselves like this, if we go to the brink on every budget issue.",
        "And so they feel - they talk about, anyway, a personal responsibility to stop that from happening.",
        "If you look at the congressional map, the Republicans who are concerned, who are stymieing any kind of deal-making, are in districts that are much more solidly red than during the last shutdown, say.",
        "And they would be more worried about a Tea Party challenge in a primary, right, than in swaying moderates in a general election.",
