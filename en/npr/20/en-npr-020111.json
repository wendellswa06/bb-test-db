        "Maybe that pre-retirees in fact will be healthier when they retire, but it may also be that they don't fully anticipate the challenges that are going to come and potential health deficits that will exist when they retire.",

        "Hello?",
        "I mean, that's what getting older is eventually about.",
        "We're all going to have serious health problems in retirement and eventually really serious health problems.",
        "Goldsmith, himself a boomer, says he's not at all surprised that his fellow boomers expect to live a long and healthy old age.",
        "There is no question that one distinguishing feature of our generation is this extraordinary, almost genetic optimism.",
        "And the poll results look to me like a lot of that optimism was drawn from a deep well of self-delusion.",
        "Indeed, he says, while some boomers are exercising and eating right, other studies show that's clearly not the norm, and the obesity epidemic in particular could be leading the baby boom into serious trouble, he says.",
        "That third of the population that's obese, we're going to see an explosion of diabetes and related illnesses that I think could take out a significant fraction of our generation significantly earlier than people expect.",
        "In fact, unexpected health problems might do more than prevent aging boomers from exercising in their later years.",
        "Sixty percent of those not yet retired in our poll said they planned to continue to work past age 65.",
        "And many who now expect to retire later than they originally thought say it's because they can't afford to retire.",
        "So health issues could put an even bigger financial burden not just on them but on their children and possibly the rest of the nation's taxpayers.",

        "Most of the time, people focus on what's inside an oyster.",

        "Oysters build these really extensive reef structures; they can be miles long.",
        "Jonathan Wilker is a chemist at Purdue University.",
        "We were curious to know how they actually do this construction feat, how they actually stuck together.",
        "So he started growing oysters in his lab.",
        "Once the oysters had snuggled up to each other and bonded together, he cut them apart to see what was making them stick.",
        "Now, Wilker has also studied other marine glue makers.",
        "Based on work with mussels, he expected the cement might be made of protein or some similar, organic compound.",
        "What the oysters seem to be doing is using a little bit of protein, or a small amount of an organic component, but have the majority of the material, 90 percent or so, be actually a hard, inorganic calcium carbonate, which is kind of like chalk.",
        "Maybe you don't think of chalk as a component of an adhesive, but then, you're not an oyster.",
        "The cement isn't all that different from the shell.",
        "The shell is also calcium carbonate and protein, just in different proportions.",
        "The cement welds the shells together.",
        "In addition to being interested in oyster cement for what it tells you about how reefs are built, Wilker says it may be possible to make something similar for mending broken bones.",
        "If you think of any glue that you buy at the store, you apply it to your surfaces, and then the first thing that you usually have to do is wait for it to dry out.",
        "Obviously, shellfish are doing something quite different.",
        "So if you wanted, say, a wet-setting surgical glue or a bone cement, something like this might be quite applicable.",
        "Wilker says he already has some potential candidates for these wet-curing cements.",
        "Another thing he's interested in is a way to defeat the cement.",
        "If you have a ship, and you do not want your ship to be encrusted with oysters and barnacles and sea grasses and things like that, maybe if you first understand how they stick, you can develop surfaces that they will not stick to.",
