        "Americans markets also showed a mixed reaction after the president unveiled his plans for changes to regulations.",
        "Bank stocks went down.",
        "That may have been in response to a big credit rating agency, Standard & Poor's, cutting its rating on 18 U.S.",
        "banks.",
        "S&P cited increased regulation as one reason for the downgrade.",
        "All this regulation, however, is still just a plan, and as it goes before Congress, NPR's Jim Zarroli spoke with traders on Wall Street.",
        "On the stock exchange floor, the talk was all about a disappointing earnings report from FedEx and a big downgrade of bank stocks.",
        "For people who make their living on Wall Street, this has been one of the most terrible and exhilarating years they've ever seen.",
        "And by now most seem resigned to the fact that the Democratic administration is going to make some changes and that it's going to be a lot tougher on Wall Street than its predecessor was.",
        "That's not to say they like what the administration is doing.",
        "I think that the reaction is mixed.",
        "Unfortunately, people have short memories and don't realize how bad things were last fall and close we were to systematic failure.",
        "Bernie McSherry of the trading firm Cuttone & Company watched the president's speech on TV a little before 1:00 and he pretty much liked what he saw.",
        "He appreciates the fact that the president wants to regulate derivatives and hedge funds more strictly.",
        "Most folks, most reasonable folks, will have to acknowledge that regulation is needed.",
        "We went through a period where there was a relatively relaxed regulatory attitude and that got us into quite a bit of trouble back in the fall.",
        "And I think this is a good step in the right direction.",
        "But McSherry says that many of his fellow traders don't agree.",
        "And he says a lot of people on Wall Street are opposed to too much government regulation of the markets.",
        "I'm a fan of free market capitalism and to me that's not what free market capitalism is about.",
        "There are people like Jason Weisberg of Seaport Securities.",
        "Our business is one of the most over-regulated businesses already.",
        "It is impossible to conduct business in a regular fashion without having to worry about dotting I's and crossing T's repeatedly throughout the day on the same issue."

        "Under the administration's plan, the Federal Reserve would be given a much stronger role in regulating very large financial institutions, those whose collapse would threaten the economy as a whole.",
        "Weisberg says that's ironic because the Fed is partly to blame for what's happened in the markets.",
        "You know, there are a lot of things that went, that took place within the regulatory function of the government where they dropped a lot of balls.",
        "They being the Fed as well.",
        "Well, I mean, the committees are going to continue to do their work, but this Ukraine scandal is happening in real time.",
        "I mean, unlike the Mueller report, where we're trying to piece together events of the past, this played out in plain view in real time to the American people.",
        "The president of the United States pressured a foreign leader to target a political opponent to help him in his reelection and then tried to cover it up.",
        "So this is, you know, this is happening now.",
        "There's evidence from the whistleblower report and the transcript that confirm that.",
        "The president's own statements admitted.",
        "And, you know, this is beginning to unfold before the American people.",
        "I think there - this Intelligence Committee is clearly going to speak to State Department officials and a number of other documents that they've requested to support this charge against the president.",
        "But I think the Judiciary Committee is, of course, the committee of jurisdiction for impeachment, so I think the expectation is all of the committees that have been doing investigations are expected to kind of send their best information, their - kind of the conclusions of their work in short order to the Judiciary Committee so that we can move expeditiously when the Intelligence Committee has concluded its investigation.",
        "Story breaking overnight - in the minute we have left, The Washington Post says in that 2017 Oval Office meeting, President Trump told the Russian ambassador and foreign minister he didn't care if Russia intervened in 2016 elections because the U.S.",
        "has done that all over the world.",
        "Yeah, well first off - OK.",
        "Well let me - I have heard Democrats say the U.S.",
        "has intervened in Russia - in elections in Latin America and other places in the world.",
        "Was the president wrong or just impolitic?",
        "No, the president's wrong.",
        "It's just not true.",
        "This stick - the campaign that the Russians engaged in, which is detailed in the Mueller report, was a systematic and sweeping effort to interfere with an American presidential election.",
        "The most sacred responsibly the president has is to defend our democracy, to make certain the American people's voices are heard, not some foreign adversary.",
        "And it's shocking that the president of the United States would have made that statement.",
        "Of course, he benefited from the Russian interference.",
        "And he, I think, has demonstrated that his concern is himself and not necessarily the health and strength of our democracy.",
        "Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, thanks so much for being with us, sir."
