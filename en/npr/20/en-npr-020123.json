        "offer for talks with specifically, the U.S.",
        "condition for talks, which is that it suspends its uranium enrichment.",
        "Now, China and Russia were at the Vienna meeting, but did they really sign onto this?",
        "Would they really agree to those further steps in the Security Council?",
        "Well, that's really the big question, that the Chinese and the Russians are here, and they have signed on to this change of plan from the U.S.",
        "The big question is, really, what happens if Iran does reject it?",
        "Because even though they signed on to this statement today, that it would then go back to the U.N.",
        "Security Council.",
        "Really, there seemed to be very few people - experts in this - who believe that the Chinese and the Russians would go down the road of sanctions.",
        "So, we'd have to cross that bridge when we came to it, but it's not at all a done deal.",
        "If the Iranians turn this down, there really would be sanctions put in place further down the road.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Well, at least for now, the U.S., Russia, China, France, Germany, the U.K.",
        "are saying the same thing: what happens next?",
        "What happens now is that the Europeans will present these proposals, this new package to the Iranians.",
        "U.S.",
        "officials have said just after this announcement today that the Iranians have several weeks in which to consider these proposals, and we really need to see whether the Iranian government wants to take hold of this, wants to take this offer.",
        "We've seen - many people are saying that these, that the pragmatists who are coming out in Washington on top here and affecting a change in U.S.",
        "policy, perhaps in Iran, we might see the same.",
        "Though, I have to say - from the people I've spoken to - there are not a huge number of optimists around.",
        "And again, optimism here would be that some time over the next several weeks - not too immediate - the Iranians would agree to suspend uranium enrichment.",
        "That's right.",
        "And one of the crucial issues here is that it's not a permanent suspension that is being sought in the first instance.",
        "It could be a temporary suspension, so that both sides could go on to talk further about something more permanent, and that would be a first step.",
        "But today, the foreign minister of Iran rejected the U.S.",
        "condition, so at the moment, it's not looking very positive.",

        "Johnson admitted that he had started his project with the outsized `dreams of a poet' but that he had been `doomed to wake a lexicographer.",

        "If you can make it a shared decision, a partnership where you all have the same goal, you want the older person to be as active and to have as full a life as possible, but you also want that person to be safe and to not have the last chapter of their life marred by a terrible, tragic accident that could have been prevented.",

        "That left the evaluation as to his ability to drive to a neutral third party that was also an expert.",

        "It varies widely.",
