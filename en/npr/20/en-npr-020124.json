        "We're talking about older drivers and what happens when it's time to give up the car keys.",
        "It's important to remember, though, that teen drivers remain far more likely to be involved in a fatal crash compared with older drivers.",
        "That's based on miles driven.",
        "The CDC reports that car accidents are the leading cause of death for U.S.",
        "teens, those between 16 and 19 years old.",
        "Any number of similar studies also tell us older drivers become increasingly likely to get into accidents once they reach 65.",
        "The rate goes up after 75 and 85 as well.",
        "We want to hear from all sides of this conversation, about when to give up the car keys.",
        "Older drivers, their kids, tell us your story, 800-989-8255.",

        "Canada approaches this issue in a more systematic way.",
        "In seven of 10 provinces, doctors are required to report concerns about a patient's ability to drive.",
        "Ontario went a step further.",
        "Since 2006, they've paid doctors to warn any patients who may not be fit to drive.",
        "Dr. Donald Redelmeier is professor of medicine at the University of Toronto.",
        "He and his colleagues recently published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that focused on Ontario and studied the effects of doctors' warnings to patients on the risk of serious car crashes.",
        "And Dr. Redelmeier joins us now from his office at the Sunnybrook Research Center in Toronto.",
        "Nice to have you with us today.",
        "It's good to be here, Neal.",
        "And was there a drop in the accident rate among those who had been warned by their physicians?",
        "Yeah, that was the main finding of our research, about a 40 to 50 percent reduction in subsequent - serious crashes, making these warnings way more effective than physician counseling about smoking cessation, exercise or weight loss.",
        "Do you have any information on what result there was?",
        "Did people give up their keys or drive more carefully?"

        "I think that some of the results might reflect cessation of driving.",
        "Yet licenses were only suspended in about 10 to 30 percent of cases.",
        "Instead, the warnings might foster more adherence to effective medical treatments, as well as more mindfulness about basic road safety advice, like signaling turns, not speeding, yielding right away and so forth.",
        "And were there any significant statistical differences between men and women, rural, urban?",
        "Yeah, we found that the warnings were particularly effective for elderly women of higher socioeconomic status who were living in rural regions, perhaps indicating a greater respect for the combination of physician and governmental authority.",
        "And does the doctor just warn the patient, or does the province get involved?",
        "It's a combination of both things, very similar to the reporting of communicable infectious diseases like tuberculosis or meningitis.",
        "The physician has to both warn the patient, as well as notify the corresponding government agency.",
        "And what do they do?",
        "They, you know, in most cases they send a rather threatening letter, which is a real blow to the patient's self-esteem, but they don't usually take away the person's license.",
        "They just take away their peace of mind.",
        "And you mentioned low self-esteem.",
        "There were some negative aspects, as well.",
        "Yeah so that, you know, these warnings are never a joy to receive.",
        "So I mean in our study, we found they were followed by about a 25 percent increase in rates of depression amongst the patients, as well as about one in 10 individuals refused to go back and see that doctor ever again.",
        "They took their business elsewhere.",
        "So this is not necessarily a good business practice for physicians."

        "Well, it's - you know, I mean it's certainly different than in China.",
        "In China, in many regions, they just have a blanket prohibition against driving after the age of 70, no stigma, no surprise, and no initiative involved.",
        "Now, they make public transit free at age 60, and they build up a lot more alternatives in the community.",
        "Those sorts of policies would never fly in a democracy such as the United States or Canada.",
        "And as you look to the future, what do you expect is going to be the trend line in Canada?",
        "Well, I think the analog is sort of the mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse, which is again a policy there's just no easy way to report that.",
        "And rates of adherence were very low in the '60s or '70s but very much now it's sort of a change.",
        "I would think that that sort of pattern is likely also to extend on to driving safety for the same rationale, that driving imposes risks on other people.",
        "What's different now, though, isn't just the aging of the population but also the convenience of modern motor vehicles with automatic transmissions and power steering and electronic seats.",
        "It's so much easier to drive a car now than it was, say, 30 or 40 years ago.",
        "In the olden days, seniors just gave up driving; it was too exhausting, and the problem used to just solve itself.",

        "And Elizabeth Dugan, in Boston, as he points out, our population is aging rapidly.",
        "This is going to become more and more of a problem.",
        "It will.",
        "In less than a decade, we should - sorry, by 2030 we can expect the number of older drivers to double.",
        "So it's a problem that we're aware of now and we'll be even more aware of in the near term.",
        "And the kinds of solutions or approaches that he's talking about in Canada, as you said, it's all different; every single state in the United States seems to be different."

        "Right, and I think it's important to keep in mind that there is no magic policy, that we don't have a test yet that will determine who's safe or not or perfectly predict who's at risk.",
        "We don't have perfect adherence when someone does have to stop driving.",
        "So we need to think at multiple levels if we're really going to solve this problem.",
        "Older drivers have to be comfortable and alert that there'll be a time when they may have to stop driving.",
        "Their family members have to be willing to talk about it.",
        "Their doctors have to be trained to assess and evaluate it.",

        "And when we started talking to mom, it probably took another year, year and a half to two years before he did stop driving.",
        "And that was very difficult.",
        "My mother really hasn't driven in about 15 years because they sort of have that traditional marriage where the guy drives and that sort of thing, and so she's taken over the driving, drives less often.",
        "So they're not getting out as much.",
        "But she really doesn't have the practice required to be a good driver either.",
        "So myself and my siblings do what we can.",
        "I live two hours away, so that's difficult.",
        "And yeah, that's difficult.",
        "I understand, Elizabeth Dugan, you had a patient who lived even further away from a parent, and what advice did you have for her?",
        "Yeah, this is really a tough case when you're geographically some distance away from an older person, and so what I recommend is the person walk around the car when they visit and see if there's accumulating dents and scrapes and that kind of thing.",
        "And for this woman who was concerned, her father was a retired professor and very intelligent, successful and accomplished person.",
        "And like most professors, we think we know everything, so he wasn't very open to her help and meddling.",
        "But I gave her a three-point plan to tackle this, and the first was to talk about it.",
        "So to put it on the table that there is likely to be a day when he's not safe to drive.",
        "Has he thought about how he wants that to go and when he'll know he's not safe to drive?"

        "So with cognitive impairment it's not, but perhaps it's cataracts or medication or something with a vehicle that could be modified.",
        "So get a formal assessment.",
        "Occupational therapy has a subspecialty or special training in driving rehabilitation, and that's a great resource and not too expensive to get.",
