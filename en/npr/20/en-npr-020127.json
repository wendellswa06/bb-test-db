        "Banksy, who gained worldwide fame for street art laden with social commentary, says it is an unauthorized show organized by, quote, \"\"unscrupulous profiteers.\"\" And as NPR's Greg Allen reports, Banksy's disapproval doesn't seem to be discouraging his fans from checking it out.",
        "More than 100,000 people saw the show when it was mounted earlier this year in Toronto.",

        "I never made any bones about it from the beginning.",

        "Let me ask you, one of the concerns has been, even by others--those not on the blog and not just to the CBC Foundation, but to others who have been raising money--that, in fact, this money is slow in getting out to the victims, that there is a need to be more expedient in getting this money out.",
