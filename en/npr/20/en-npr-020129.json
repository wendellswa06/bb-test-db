        "As President Trump walked into the World Economic Forum, he was surrounded by cameras and reporters all asking a variation on the same question.",

        "Fake news, folks, fake news.",
        "What's your message today?",
        "Typical New York Times fake story.",
        "Now, claiming fake news is nothing new for the president, and he often applies that label to factual stories he simply doesn't like.",
        "From there it was onto meetings with other world leaders and then a speech.",
        "Trump was there at the gathering of global elites in Davos to make a pitch.",

        "So come to America, where you can innovate, create and build.",
        "I believe in America.",
        "Trump's speech was quite similar to remarks he's delivered at other international forums and meetings, read carefully without veering into the kind of improvisation that characterizes his rally speeches in the U.S.",
        "Trump in this setting sought to explain his America First rallying cry as looking out for the American people first but not turning away from the rest of the world."

        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "We have agreements with several of them already.",
        "We would consider negotiating with the rest either individually or perhaps as a group if it is in the interests of all.",
        "The other countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership are moving on together without the U.S.",

        "For a couple of days you could judge for yourself because the Zyprexa documents were posted on the Web by individuals to whom they were also leaked.",
        "But on December 18th, one day after the Times' first story ran, Lilly sought and obtained a temporary court order to get its documents back.",
        "The New York Times refused, but the Web links were shut down.",

        "And the Supreme Court, in interpreting the First Amendment, has defined the press very broadly because it doesn't want to foreclose new types of people who are engaged in press-like activities from claiming First Amendment protection.",
        "Richards thinks the court will decide that John Doe is a full-fledged member of the press.",
        "But to release the documents on the Web, Richards says, Judge Weinstein will also have to decide that the public interest in knowing what's in the documents outweighs Lilly's interest in protecting its trade secrets.",
