        "It's the same drug combination used in Florida and 33 other states.",

        "Mr.",

        "It's not cruel and unusual punishment.",
        "So, I don't think that any big impediment is going to remain there.",
        "But defense attorneys here say, while the three drug combination is the same, in other ways Florida is much different than Kentucky.",

        "And it took him 34 minutes to die, twice as long as in most executions.",
        "An investigation later found that death chamber personnel had incorrectly inserted the IV needles in the Diaz's veins.",

        "He wants it to stay very much the Central Intelligence Agency running both analysis and spy and clandestine efforts.",
