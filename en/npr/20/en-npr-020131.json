        "There would have been no way for them to know that what will happen next will change everything, that it will lead to the murder of one of these three men and radically alter the lives of the other two.",
        "The man who was killed that night was Reverend James Reeb, a Unitarian minister and civil rights activist.",
        "People across the country were outraged after his murder.",
        "The case remained unsolved for 50 years until two journalists from Alabama, Andrew Beck Grace and Chip Brantley, set out to reinvestigate the case for a new NPR podcast.",

        "Good morning.",
        "Thanks for coming by early, really appreciate it.",
        "Will you tell us something about who James Reeb was?",
        "Well, James Reeb was a Unitarian minister who's living in Boston in 1965.",
        "And he, along with millions of other Americans, saw the violence that had happened in Selma during Bloody Sunday - this confrontation between state troopers and sheriff's possemen and peaceful protesters - and was outraged.",
        "Dr. King called for men of clergy - clergymen from all over the country and women too to come to Selma to assist with another voting rights march.",
        "So James Reeb came from Boston, along with a lot of other folks, and was in the city for less than 24 hours, went to a restaurant - an integrated restaurant - with two of his colleagues and was attacked as they left by a group of men on the street.",
        "And then, basically, he died two days later in - at a hospital in Birmingham."

        "There were many cases like this.",
        "What made you focus on this particular one?",
        "Well, there were some really interesting things about this case.",
        "The first is that when Reeb was killed, the eyes of the nation were already sort of on Selma.",
        "And so his death and the attack that led to his death became something of a flash point for the movement.",
        "And his death was protested around the nation.",
        "LBJ mentioned his name in the speech announcing the Voting Rights Act.",
        "So there was this awareness, this heightened awareness of the murder of this white man that far outweighed the awareness of the murder of so many African Americans who'd been killed during the civil rights movement as well.",
        "And did you find an opportunity, a special opportunity to look at the facts of this case anew?",
        "Yes.",
        "We - one of the reasons we took this story on is because we had some extra sort of special, I guess, research tools, which was an unredacted FBI file and also just reams of evidence from the National Archives.",
        "So we went down to Selma with that FBI file and with evidence that we found.",
        "And really what we discovered that made this story so unique is that the men who were acquitted of this murder in December of 1965, they had been acquitted by this - what we came to call the counter narrative, this alternate theory of what really happened to James Reeb, that he wasn't attacked on the street that night and died by the hands of these attackers.",
        "But, instead, the movement was in need of a white martyr, and so they conspired to take this opportunity and have him die because they needed his death.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Yeah.",
        "OK.",
        "That's fine.",
