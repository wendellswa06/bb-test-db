        "I mean, just flatly no. There's lots of arguments, in fact, going on right now over the numbers, because essentially, you know, General Petraeus - David Petraeus, who gave testimony this week, said in an interview with NPR that he was not definitive about the idea that 30,000 troops could come home by the middle of 2008.",
        "He said they were trying to look at exactly what could be done and whether troops may have to be shifted in terms of their role, shifting from combat missions to maybe acting as training the Iraqi police and military.",
        "And last night President Bush was not definitive either.",
        "I mean, he said that we could bring home 2,200 by December plus an army brigade and that would total, according to the president, 5,700.",
        "But it's not clear exactly whether or not that would subtract from what he - the surge.",
        "I mean, it's going to pull down the surge, but the question is how much, and is he talking about taking away people who were added as part of the surge or is he really talking about people that existed before the surge.",
        "So overall, the surge added about 30,000 people between February and the middle of this year.",
        "We now have 169,000 people on the ground, an all-time high.",
        "So altogether if he just lived up to what he said last night, it'd be about 12,000 people.",
        "It wouldn't be anywhere near 30,000, Madeleine.",
        "We're not at all apologetic about the fact that we're trying to support the full sovereignty of two independent states and members of the United Nations, Moldova and Georgia.",
        "Alexei Makarkin of the Center for Political Technologies says the fundamentally different values of the two countries has complicated Russian American relations.",
        "(Through translator) Russians project their own realities onto their image of the west.",
        "We often just don't understand the west.",
        "For example, when courts rule one way or another, we believe the decisions are ordered by the country's leaders.",
        "And Makarkin says when major American newspapers publish articles critical of the Kremlin, Russians tend to believe they're ordered by the White House.",
        "But Makarkin also says western countries fail to understand how Russia operates.",
        "He sites new restrictions against non-governmental organizations, which Russians officials accuse of using foreign money to meddle in Russian politics.",
        "But western donors say they're only interested in developing democracy.",
        "Again, Alexei Makarkin.",
        "(Through translator) There's a kind of escalation going on based on mutual misunderstanding, suspicion, and serious phobias and for now it's not clear how to end that escalation."
