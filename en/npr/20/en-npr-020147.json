        "Welcome to you all.",
        "Ms. FRANCES COLEMAN (Mobile Register) and Ms. MARGARET SULLIVAN (The Buffalo News): (In unison) Thank you.",
        "Margaret Sullivan, do you get a sense that your readers are following the political process in Iraq and watching to see whether or not what the outcome will be of the constitution, what the debate has been between the majorities and those who feel left out?",
        "I think that our readers are following the conflict in Iraq, the war in Iraq, if you will, quite closely.",
        "I'm not sure that the details of the constitution are terribly meaningful, but the overall situation is extremely interesting to them.",
        "Frances?",
        "Yes, I agree.",
        "It was funny; I was thinking the same thing.",
        "They are intensely interested in the war, but the constitutional kind of debate and--I'm not sure anybody in my readership can much tell the difference between a Sunni and a Shiite, but they know that overall this constitutional gathering and consensus is critical to which direction the country takes, and certainly down here we understand, you know, arguing about religion.",
        "That resonates with my readers.",
        "Now just this past week, a Gallup poll found that 54 percent of the respondents asked believed that the Iraq War was a mistake.",
        "Is that the feeling that you're getting, Phil Casaus, in Albuquerque?"

        "Yeah.",
        "I think it's right about that level.",
        "I believe that what you're finding--what we're finding a lot is that people who had supported the war early on find that the inability for the administration to exactly define when success might even be close to being achieved is continuing to wear them down.",
        "We had this sort of an interesting situation where one of our columnists last week wrote a column about Cindy Sheehan and her protest near Crawford, and he criticized what he considered as the left's basically taking her grief and using it as an anti-war banner in essence.",
        "We got a lot of letters about that.",
        "You could sense the frustration from readers saying that this woman is really not feeling--is feeling something very different from most of us, but that her frustration and the wanting to know what the purpose of the sacrifice was, was really palpable.",
        "They want to know when we'll be able to see success, and in lieu of that, when we'll be able to see troops coming home.",
        "Frances Coleman in Mobile, the president said this past week that one of the things the nation must do--and he mentioned the number of US soldiers killed had exceeded 1,800--was to honor the memories of those who had died by staying the course.",
        "Have you had a reaction to that from your readers?",
        "I have not seen a reaction in our letters to that particular remark, although our readers in general are writing letters that say whether we agree or disagree with the fact that we're in Iraq, now that we're there, yeah, we do have to stay the course.",
        "They seem to understand you can't just pack up and leave without fairly catastrophic results.",
        "We have a lot of--well, Alabama's a big National Guard state, so we have a lot of folks from this area who are over in Iraq.",
        "So I don't know when I've seen so many vigorous letters from both sides of the political spectrum and both sides of the war debate, so they take on all those topics.",
        "But overall, I see them saying, `Well, we're there; we do have to stay the course.'",
        "Now you mentioned that Alabama is a big military state, but you also mentioned that public opinion seems divided.",
        "Does this remind you in any way of the polarization of opinion that went on in the Vietnam era?",
        "Well, that's interesting because we're getting letters now where people try to compare this war to Vietnam, and other writers--we have a letter that's running tomorrow from a reader saying, `Don't be ridiculous.",
        "This is not Vietnam,' so there is a good bit of debate, and there are plenty of folks--I'm sure some of them are military-connected--who know the terrible toll that war takes on countries and on individuals and they know that we said we were going over there to ferret out the weapons of mass destruction and we got there and, duh, where were they?",
        "So you know, there are some people who fear that Bush has led us in a terrible direction, but there are also a lot of people who believe that he's doing the right thing.",
