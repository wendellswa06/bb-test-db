        "Yes.",

        "Frances Coleman in Mobile, how does today compare to a year ago?",
        "I think the Mobile area population is also getting more concerned, more nervous, more uneasy at the death toll rises, as the terrorist attacks, the insurgent attacks seem to come just on a steady, daily basis.",
        "You know one thing I see down here too, and I don't know if Margaret and Phil are seeing this as well, but I think Phil spoke to it a little while ago, is that we have a constant debate in our letters about whether you can criticize, dissect, doubt or otherwise question the war and still be a patriot.",

        "And that led Republicans then, especially Republicans on Capitol Hill and supporters of the president's policy to say that the general was being demeaned, that he's an honorable man and being treated badly, caricatured, and that there was a suggestion that he was somehow a traitor, a word that was never used.",
        "And then there were calls for Democrats, leading Democrats, not only to denounce the ad but to distance themselves from MoveOn.org.",
        "Now, at the same time the supporters of the president, led by his former press secretary, Ari Fleischer, have been running ads on television.",

        "Is that true, and do you have any sense of what that relationship is shaping up to be?",
        "I feel like, you know, the law enforcement and elected officials are trying to say that they met with protesters just to say that and just to get a story line.",
