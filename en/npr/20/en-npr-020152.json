        "No, it's absolutely true.",
        "And I think that we're not used to hearing politicians speak in such undiplomatic terms.",
        "But very few people can argue with the point--that is, that immigrant labor in this country takes on jobs that are unsafe, that are dirty, that are underpaid, that most Americans, regardless of race, do not want.",
        "And what the--those who take offense should take offense to is the fact that people have to work under those conditions and not whether or not someone calls attention to it.",
        "I find it hypocritical for those who would criticize the president of Mexico and not criticize working conditions that both African-Americans and many immigrants are subjected to.",
        "Let me, George Curry, take you back to what we talked about there and that is the anniversary of the Million Man March, which will be commemorated by a rally October 15th on the National Mall in Washington, DC.",
        "Many people, while applauding that day, suggest that the movement within itself stalled, that we didn't see much out of--a friend of mine calls it the `million man picnic,' that we had a great day but nothing more came of it.",
        "When we commemorate this, George Curry, what should we do in commemoration of it?",
        "Well, you and I both were there 10 years ago, Ed.",
        "You were doing the broadcast all day for BET as I recall.",
        "It was quite an event.",
        "The challenge is--and this is where you judge Farrakhan and the rest of the leaders--is what do you do once the march is over?",
        "There were promises made that there would be an infrastructure in place.",
        "Jesse Jackson made similar promises after he ran in '84 and '88.",
        "Al Sharpton said he was going to put infrastructure there.",
        "Ed, you talk about GARE(ph) in 1972, political events, they all said they were going to have something after the event.",
        "That has not happened.",
        "So the true test in my estimation is what happens when the march is over to empower our communities?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Well, it's no surprise to me that nothing came out of it because that's typical of the empty promises of today's civil rights movement.",
        "And, you know, the concept of a million man march was a great one.",
        "Unfortunately, it was marred by controversy because of Farrakhan's involvement.",
        "This is where the churches in our community should have come, stepped forward and not allowed someone who spews hate speech when he calls, you know, white people devils, you know, and makes disparaging comments about Jews.",
        "Unfortunately, that takes away from any of the positive empowerment messages that Farrakhan may have.",
        "And that's just fact.",
        "And so I hope that this year's 10-year commemoration of that march will produce more fruitful results.",
        "Tara ...(unintelligible).",
        "Let's be honest, though, Tara...",
        "...Farrakhan because Farrakhan hasn't used the term `white devils' in decades.",
        "I've covered him quite frequently and you're talking about the old...",
        "He's never apologized for it.",
        "...Muslim--like it--no, but you're saying--he doesn't use that language anymore."

        "All right.",
        "Let me see if I can bring it back to something--and here is the issue with Farrakhan in this, Pedro, and we see it.",
        "He is such a spark that we see the ire of terror and George raised in talking about him, yet we miss offtimes the message.",
        "Should we blame the speaker, the controversial speaker?",
        "Or should we blame ourselves for not being able to discern the importance of the message through that?",
        "No, I think, again, we have to look at the message and why it was that Louis Farrakhan was able to attract so many people to the Capitol that day for this march.",
        "He was speaking to an issue for which there's great concern--that is, what's happening with African-American men in this country where today we have more African-American men in prison than in the colleges and universities.",
        "So when Louis Farrakhan speaks to an issue like that, he will generate great support.",
        "The fact is that I fault that movement because in 1995, when they were marching on Washington, I was there.",
        "You had Congress enacting the Contract on America.",
        "Meanwhile, so the Congress is taking away programs from the same communities that we are trying to uplift.",
        "So the politics of it, I think, were off, but the intent, the intent of getting men to take more responsible role in the communities, I find anyone who could argue with that is really--I don't know what planet they're on.",
        "Two quick notes here...",
        "Of course Farrakhan has controversial language, there's no question about that.",
        "But people who've heard Farrakhan for 20, 30 years, know how to discount there and look to the other message which is important when he talks about self-help.",
        "Tara, you should love him.",
        "I mean, a lot of things...",
        "No.",

        "...on self-help.",
        "George, that's absolutely not true, and, you know, I find it disheartening that we as--especially in the black community, make exception to our messengers and allow them, `Well, it's OK for them to say one thing as long as that's positive and something we want to hear.",
        "But it's not OK.",
        "Let's brush under the rug the other things that they say.",
        "It's a double standard because if a white Republican ever said the same things that Farrakhan said, there would be protests from New York to Los Angeles.",
        "So there's a double standard and I think we shouldn't do that.",

        "It created opportunities for people to get jobs, get off the welfare roles, and that's just a misnomer that it was taking away jobs, just something else that the emotion of the issue and bringing people to Washington under false pretenses as far as using the Contract with America as a rallying point.",
        "All right.",

        "A, we should note the commemoration will not only include African-American men, in particular, but it's called a Millions More Movement, and it is far more inclusive than the first one in terms of the call.",
        "We should also note historically that whether you like him or not, I contend--and, Tara, you raised the question of black churches.",
        "I don't think that there was any African-American institution or leader at the time that would have been able to call across generations and, quite frankly, ideology as did Farrakhan at that time.",
        "I think any other leader would have paled in comparison in terms of pulling the numbers at that particular time.",
        "Now whether you agree politically with the Contract on America or not, Dick Gregory raised an interesting question as we talked immediately following the Million Man March.",
        "And his suggestion that what should have been done there was to register to vote, to mobilize African-Americans and show Washington at that point the power of the vote, and that speaks to, George, what you suggested there, the idea of a follow-up.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's move forward and take a look at legislation that will be enacted in Atlanta.",
        "A ban on panhandling near downtown Atlanta, and in particular, obviously, the tourist attractions was approved this week by City Council--that, in spite of hundreds protesting, suggesting that this is simply an attack on the poor.",
        "Atlanta businesspeople are suggesting that there are parts of Atlanta that are so overrun with aggressive beggars that businesses are suffering.",
        "So as we take a look at the balance of fairness to all, Pedro, where do you fall on this?",
        "I don't know why the existing laws are not adequate to cover someone who is aggressively harassing someone on the street and begging for money.",
        "When you pass an additional law to ban panhandling, you run the risk of both violating civil liberties, `cause it's not a crime to ask someone for money, and second of all, you run the risk of engaging in racial profiling because we know who is most likely to be targeted for harassment by the police.",
        "So what concerns me is the additional law.",
        "I think the law should be adequate to deal with this problem."

        "Well, I came from Key West, Florida, where I spent the last two years dealing with setting up faith-based homeless programs there.",
        "And Key West has passed a similar panhandling anti-panhandling ban.",
        "And it's an interesting debate because on the one hand, you have the ability--what's any different from a Girl Scout asking someone on the street to buy Girl Scout cookies or to solicit donations for a cause?",
        "And what makes that any different than someone who's fallen into a bad way that's asking someone for a couple of dollars?",
        "It brings up a very interesting argument.",
        "However, coming from dealing with the homeless community hands-on, oftentimes, aggressive panhandlers, especially in areas in business districts and in tourist areas--it becomes a matter of harassment.",
        "And when you continue to oblige these individuals, it enables them to stay in their--to fall into this bad way and continue to do that, whereas in Atlanta, and the same thing in Key West, there are programs, they're given referrals.",
        "Well, if you're caught panhandling, why don't we give you a referral?",
        "You can go to this homeless program where they can get job training or where they can get the services they need if they're mentally incapacitated or have a substance abuse problem.",
        "And sometimes, that's what it takes.",

        "I mean, sure, they're an inconvenience to us, but when you weigh that against a need, some legitimate needs that some people have, you know, it says what we've become as a country.",
        "Yes, it's an inconvenience to us, but I don't think a law should be passed against it.",

        "We've seen the awful power of the tsunami, a wave of seawater more than 20-feet-high sweeping into the flat green farmland around the city of Sendai, pushing boats and cars and houses inland and then dragging them back into the sea.",
        "And now Japan waits to see what will happen to nuclear power plants on the northeast coast and if the physical damage caused by the earthquake will cascade into a serious nuclear accident.",
        "All of this is bringing back images closer to home - the houses and cars piled up by the onrushing then retreating tsunami reminds us all of the floods caused by Hurricane Katrina, where we saw the same heaps of houses.",
        "I have never been in a strong earthquake, but in 1989 I was one of the reporters sent to cover the aftermath of one - the Loma Prieta earthquake in California.",
        "In San Francisco, we could see damage caused when the earthquake rippled through the city - cracked pavements, downed power lines, occasional geysers caused by broken water mains."
