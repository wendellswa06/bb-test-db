        "So what is - exactly does this mean?",

        "Well, a lot of this isn't going to kick in till after the next elections, and those are set for 2019.",
        "But, I mean, really Erdogan has been acting like a very strong president ever since he was elected in 2014.",
        "And at the moment, he's got extraordinary powers because of this state of emergency Steve referenced, this huge purge, more than 100,000 people - military, civil service, media.",
        "And the government yesterday sees this vote as a public stamp of approval for Erdogan's increasingly strong-handed rule basically.",
        "But what is he ruling?",
        "- a very divided nation, no matter how many times he called for unity.",
        "You know, I listened to his speech last night.",

        "Belongs to him...",
        "(CROSSTALK)",
        "It belongs to him, not the people, which is...",
        "It almost sounded that way for a minute.",
        "And he's threatening to bring back the death penalty.",
        "That could end the EU bid for Turkey, raise a lot of questions about where it's heading.",
        "And you know, as we keep saying, this is important.",
        "All those anti-ISIS airstrikes, they're coming from Turkish air bases.",

        "And those strains, we have to say, are pretty - and those ties, we have to say, are pretty strained right now.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, you mentioned an important but strained relationship with the United States.",
        "Scott Detrow, I mean, President Obama tolerated Erdogan as it looked like there were signs he was moving closer and closer to being more authoritarian with these crackdowns and so forth.",
        "Is there any sign that President Trump is going to handle this relationship differently?",
        "I don't think so.",
        "I know one consistent of Trump has been his comfort with autocratic or strongman rulers, his praise for Vladimir Putin very well-documented, I think it's safe to say.",
        "You know, he met with Egypt's president, el-Sissi, the other week in the White House.",

        "That's a response that, you know, as Peter mentioned, involved a lot of crackdowns.",
        "So Peter, no sign that the U.S.-Turkey relationship is going to change fundamentally here?",
        "You always hear that it's too important economically, securitywise.",
        "But at the moment, the rhetoric is certainly on a very dangerous edge.",
        "This is a reminder, I think, that when you learn in school that democracy is majority-rule, that's an incomplete answer.",
        "It's not quite right.",
        "It's not even just the rule of law.",

        "So I asked Cleveland police how did they learn about the incident - was it from Facebook, and are they working with Facebook in any way on this incident?",
        "But I haven't heard back from the police yet.",
        "But it just raises questions about the role of a social media organization in a tragic event like this.",
        "Well, so we'll be watching to see how Facebook continues to react to this.",
        "Will they crack down on these postings where people are in physical danger?",
        "Will there be calls for more oversight over social media, and will that be self-regulated oversight or government-regulated oversight maybe?",
        "As far as self-regulation goes, Facebook has now removed the video, but some have continued to share it.",
        "So if you look on Twitter, you'll see people are asking others to not continue to circulate this video.",
        "The kind of self-regulating you're talking about there, if people would be willing to do that.",
        "Annie Wu from WCPN Ideastream, thanks a lot.",

        "Brandi had always been careful and conscientious.",
        "So why did she make these mistakes?",
        "One explanation - the psychological phenomenon of scarcity.",
        "When you have scarcity, and it creates a scarcity mindset, it leads you to take certain behaviors which, in the short term, help you manage scarcity but in the long term, only make matters worse.",

        "When you're hungry, it's hard to think of anything other than food, when you're desperately poor, you constantly worry about making ends meet.",
        "Scarcity produces a kind of tunnel vision, and it explains why, when we're in a hole, we often lose sight of long-term priorities and dig ourselves even deeper.",
