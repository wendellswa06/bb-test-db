        "But in gun suicide, the gun is not blamed.",
        "The gun is actually considered, you know, not the problem, and it's that, you know, they tend to more put a stigma on the person, oh there was something wrong with him.",
        "So in the reporting on this, it was - you know, and in talking to the experts, when you go to the academic experts and those kind of people, they have a very strong conviction, and they look at the data about access to guns and suicide, and how much more suicide there is in places where there are a lot of guns.",
        "And they make a very big deal about the guns, whereas when you move actually to those places that have the high suicide rates, you hear much more that the gun is not the issue, that it's about mental health, and, you know, they really do not have a push against the guns that you get.",
        "So it's kind of an interesting disparity between the academic experts on suicide and the people that are actually in the high suicide areas.",
        "I was kind of surprised at how big a difference there was in that point of view.",
        "Just to flip that on the other side, yes a state like Wyoming, which has a very high access to guns and a very high suicide rate, compared to a state like Massachusetts, where it's more difficult to get a gun, and suicide rates are lower.",
        "About one-seventh as high in Massachusetts, as compared to Wyoming.",
        "I mean that's a pretty amazing discrepancy because as one of the experts said, there's no reason that people with - that gun owners have a higher rate of mental disorder, of mental health issues.",
        "So there really should not be a reason for there to be a higher rate of suicides.",
        "But what you get with the suicide, and this is what the experts talk about, it's not a permanent feature.",
        "It is an impulse.",
        "And if you can act on that impulse, then of course it becomes permanent.",
        "But if you can be intercepted, intervened, and, you know, with my story we ran tips about suicide prevention, then, you know, I'm sorry, I don't have the exact statistic off the top of my head, I think it was 90 percent of people who have attempted suicide and failed then did not go on to kill themselves.",
        "So that once you stop it, but especially say for instance with teenagers, we have a lot of places where we have special laws to prevent teenagers from their own impulsiveness when it comes to driving, drinking, other issues with regard to teenagers.",
        "But when it comes to guns, teenagers with access to guns and the suicide rate there is very high and especially teenagers who commit suicide almost always do it with their family's gun.",
        "We're talking with Dan Keating of the Washington Post about the epidemiology of drug - of gun deaths.",

        "I'm sorry.",

        "We live in a rural community in Wyoming, and for the last - in the last 12 months we have had six suicides in our small community of about 5,000 people, all genders - both genders, all ages, all incomes, and the discussion about guns and access to guns it totally verboten here.",
        "Everyone talks about access to mental health, rather than the access to guns being a contributing factor to these deaths.",
        "When we hear about gun violence in the city and how it tears neighborhoods and families apart, what's been the effect of so many suicides in a small place like Buffalo, Wyoming?",
        "It's very sobering.",
        "Everybody knows someone who has died of a suicide.",
        "And it is something that affects our school children, it is something that affects our community.",
        "We had a prominent community member commit suicide earlier this year.",

        "Oh, I think this has been going on for a long time.",
        "It's not been a secret.",
        "But I think these trends have probably been here I would say for at least 40 years."

        "And is there any reason that you've come up with to explain that?",
        "I think there are lots of reason for the discrepancy.",
        "And let me talk about the suicide first and for the high rates and that because I think there's a very, very fundamental problem in the way we think about this.",
        "And one of the guests, the call-in people, said that people think that it's either the guns or mental health that is the issue.",
        "They can, and there's also - we had a couple of years ago, it was probably in the late '90s where we had a lot of copycat suicides, but not with guns.",
        "That was with hanging.",
        "And what's really important to understand is it's not either or.",
        "It's both.",
        "And if you want to make the world safe for your child, for your child who might commit suicide, then you do everything you can.",
        "It's not that you have to choose either take away access to guns from young people or get them the mental health care they want, it's both.",
        "Both are part of the causal chain.",
        "And the way you interrupt the causal chain is in as many places as you possibly can, if you want to save those children's lives.",
        "There's a story that I was told.",
        "I went to work at a school when they had a suicide, because they were afraid there might be a suicide cluster that followed the one death.",
        "And they told me that in a year previously, a young student from this school was hell-bent on suicide and killing himself.",
        "And he took his car, he drove it into a big concrete bridge at 60 miles per hour, and he walked away because he had an air bag.",
        "Now it wasn't necessary to treat his depression or to stop him from being impulsive, but the air bag saved his life.",
        "If you want to save the lives of our young people who are committing suicide, reducing their access to the fatal means is just as important as giving them mental health.",
        "And as a parent or a concerned citizen, you want to make sure that they get every possible treatment that could prevent their suicide.",
        "I think people do not understand the importance of having access to the means of suicide.",
        "So many studies have demonstrated if you take the means away, you reduce the suicide.",
        "In a lot of places, though, a gun is a tool.",
        "It's like any other tool on a ranch.",
        "You've got to have it.",

        "It's not just the person who pulls the trigger and the person who receives the bullet.",
        "There's a huge impact on people who grow up either in families where a suicide by gun has occurred or in a community where someone in their family has been shot, and the effects in terms of post-traumatic stress disorder, just living in high anxiety and the subsequent illness it causes, these costs are tremendous, and we're just starting to realize and appreciate those.",
        "There are also something called the cycle of violence.",
        "So a child who grows up exposed to violence becomes more likely, him or herself, to employ violence in the future.",
        "So the impact is very extensive."

        "Please, Dan Keating, can you help us out?",
        "Well, the rates for women are just much lower for both homicide death and suicide death, and the discrepancies are not as great but it is still white women are much more likely to commit suicide than black women.",
        "That pattern of suicide by whites is one of the longstanding and interesting pattern, and I have never heard really a good explanation for it.",
        "So but in any event, the death rates by gun for women are considerably lower, and unfortunately the data that we used for this, the CDC data, does not have full event data.",
        "So for instance you cannot see when you see that a woman died of a homicide, whether, say, it was a homicide-suicide event, where someone killed her and killed themself.",
        "So that makes it a little bit incomplete because in fact I would be very curious if even as few or as low as the rates of whites dying from homicide is, if you were able to factor out the kind of suicide-homicide, murder-suicide cases, that the white homicide rate would be even lower.",

        "Girls will attempt quite a bit more, but they don't use guns as often, and are more likely to survive.",
        "And the second part is that there is still such a stigma associated with the cause of death when it's suicide, that even though the kids in the community will know how someone died, there's not always a discussion in the community at large about it; although I have to say in Boulder we're working pretty hard and have a state suicide task force, as well.",

        "There was a very small group who had been seriously, chronically depressed and had thought about this for a very long time.",
