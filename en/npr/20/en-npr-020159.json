        "I hospitalize a lot of kids that are suicidal, and the correlation also between poor impulse control and drug and alcohol use plays a huge factor.",
        "Very big, and so the suggestion is that if you can prevent them from having access to the fatal means when they have the impulse - separate the impulse from the action - you can save their lives.",
        "And this is very, very important because if you have a waiting period, if people can't buy a gun right away but have to wait a week, that reduces the number of suicides.",
        "There are things that work based on understanding the impulsive nature of suicide, especially in young people.",
        "Here's a tweet to that point from Riggs Mack: Guns in the rural Midwest never seemed like an issue until my 16-year-old cousin made a snap decision while angry and drunk and took his own life.",
        "Many of these come from anger, from intoxication and a sudden event that triggers a feeling in them that quickly will pass if only we can keep them separated from the fatal means while they have that impulse.",

        "You drew a correlation earlier that in African-American communities, largely in urban areas, where there's a lot of homicides, there is also an attitude that it favors gun control.",
        "Vice versa in rural areas, where there are lots of suicides among white people.",
        "Can you draw that line that because these are homicides, therefore people are in favor of gun control or because they are suicides they are opposed to it?",
        "Well, I think - I think you can draw that line, and I think that the key connector in between is not blaming the gun; is that - and I think it's exactly what people have just been talking about in terms of how the reaction in the community is suicide, the reaction is so muted.",
        "It does ripple, it does tear holes in a community, but it does so quietly because people don't want to talk about it.",
        "And I think there's an amazing irony here that the media is often accused of making a big deal about white crime victims and ignoring black crime victims.",
        "But the truth of the matter is when it comes to gun crime, black crime is very much in the news, and politicians campaign on crime and safety and all these kind of issues."

        "But the white people that are - you know, a lot more white people die from suicide than black people die from homicide with guns, but there's - nobody campaigns on suicide.",
        "Nobody's making a huge outcry about it, and the vast majority of these suicide deaths receive no publicity and no public discussion.",
        "So the fact of the matter is these deaths don't generate - I think people are vastly unaware of how many white people kill themselves.",
        "And there's all this discussion about what's going on in the black community with all these homicides, but you don't hear anybody saying what's going on in the white community with all these people shooting themselves.",
        "What - you know, there's no good reason that we can't intervene and lower this suicide rate, but nobody's talking about it.",
        "And so nobody's making the connection between a ridiculously high rate that shouldn't be there and access to guns and issues about mental health.",

        "And I think what Dan showed beautifully in this article is that the victims are not just children in classrooms who are massacred occasionally, but the victims of - largest part of the victims are young black men in their communities and young white men in their homes.",
        "These are big parts of the gun violence problem.",
        "And I think that there's a stigma not only to people who commit suicide, but I think there's also a stigma to people who are homicide victims.",
        "And I think we stigmatize young black men who get shot.",
        "And we don't give them fair justice and fair treatment.",
        "We say, oh, these are just young black gang members and we don't think about the people who didn't belong to a gang, who were shot unintentionally, the wrong victim was picked or they were an innocent bystander or, yes, they were involved in something, but didn't deserve to die.",

        "That is a very - it's interesting, because when you go between countries, another example of it gets cited a lot of times that you could find prominently on the NRA website, for instance, is that Russia has very tight gun control, very few guns, but a very high suicide rate and a very high homicide rate.",
        "Whereas Israel, which has very high gun possession, has a very low suicide rate.",
        "(Unintelligible) the same way, yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So when you get into the international - and India has a very high suicide rate and interestingly there it's women, which is different than in the U.S., and there are certainly very important cultural reasons having to do with suicide with women in India.",

        "But within the United States, when you look at things like gun possession by state, the pattern becomes very clear.",

        "That is the most common cause of suicide in China and around the world.",
        "And it's been shown that if you can decrease access to the pesticides or if you can substitute non-lethal pesticides for what are ordinarily used, the suicide rate comes way down.",

        "It is, you know, there are kind of age bursts up in suicide and older - there is kind of an age bursts up for the rate among young people, but then again, among older people where, you know, a lot of people have said depression is insufficiently diagnosed and treated.",
