        "He said famously that he had had it up to his keester with leaks.",
        "And he tried to impose polygraph tests, lie detector tests on a big chunk of the executive branch.",
        "So there are the kind of more, like, social gossipy leaks.",
        "And then what other kinds of leaks are there?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, the other part, of course, is national security leaks.",

        "Confidentiality helps with candor.",

        "I mean, on the one hand, it does seem like leaks can be good and give essential information in a democracy, help keep the government honest.",
        "But on the other hand, leaks can be really dangerous.",
        "I mean, is it a net positive or a net negative?",
