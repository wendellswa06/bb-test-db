        "And the regime - the leaders were the people I met mostly when I was there - but you get that also from people who are not leaders, and who've been given a big dose of not only propaganda, but also a lot of very credible, you know, arguments.",

        "It's a belief that we are systematically trying to squeeze them financially, and bring them down even without military action.",

        "Now, you've got an atmosphere which has changed in the last five years.",
        "It's okay, it's respectable to want to make money and so people are looking for enterprises to start kiosks, mom and pop stores.",
        "The state enterprises in North Korea used to be the typical communist style of economy.",
        "If a factory lost money, the central government made up the loss, and if they made money, they didn't really gain from it - the people who were running the factory.",
        "Now they are encouraged to keep - if the make money they keep more of it.",
        "If they lose money, they do not get subsidized.",
        "And although the state continues to own enterprises, everything is really, it's leased, it's kind of a halfway house to privatization and people can profit from their hard work."

        "So, you know, we're in very small areas right now.",
        "We have had greater access in the past but, you know, following - well, since last December the government asked us to reduce our presence in the country.",
        "A year ago the World Food Program was feeding about 6 million people in North Korea.",

        "Is access to feeding those people restricted because of lack of food, or is it restricted by the North Korean government?",
        "We have a policy of no access, no food and, you know, we try to enforce as much as we can the monitoring side of the process.",
        "We, I think, are facing mainly challenges from not having enough resources.",
        "For example, we should be in 50 counties in the country right now but we're only able to work in 30 because we don't have the money to expand our operation.",
        "And I think very soon it's, you know, the North Korean government is going to realize that because of the drop-off in bilateral aid, they are going to need an increase in WFP presence in the country, but we're not going to be able to do that if we don't get the money in.",
