        "Have you seen and noticed any changes over the course of your visits?",
        "I have, and I also noted See-Lig's observations there and I have to agree with him.",
        "I mean, I've only been going there since 2001 but most certainly in the last week that I was there I did notice many more cars on the street, many more people sort of mingling around, and also a very - a much lighter atmosphere to what I have noticed before.",
        "I think people in general, at least in the capital, look healthier than what they did when I first went there five years ago - sorry - yeah, exactly - when I first went there five years ago.",
        "And I also think that there's an element of ease among many people.",
        "They do just seem more relaxed.",
        "There seems to be - they seem to be less regimented.",
        "And you know, I saw kids in primary schools being much more relaxed and much more, you know, sort of spontaneous in the way that they behave, and I took that to be a very promising sight.",
        "There's much less of a personality cult than there used to be.",
        "I mean, when Kim Il Sung was the leader you had loudspeakers booming out over everywhere you went.",
        "With Kim Jong Il there's still a lot of that stuff but it's much softer.",
        "Would you agree Mike?",
        "Yes, I would.",
        "I was never there when Kim Il Sung was alive but I definitely think that there is a massive change.",
        "Mike Huggins, thanks very much, and we're going to let you get back to bed.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Mike Huggins is spokesman for the World Food Program - just returned from five days in North Korea - with us on the phone from Beijing in China, and let's see if we can get another caller on the line.",

        "I was watching one of the cable news channels last week and a North Korean woman who actually escaped to China was interviewed.",
        "She lived in a village and I was surprised by two things: A, she said that she had a VCR and B, she said she watched smuggled South Korean soap operas on that VCR and she said that she and a lot of her fellow villagers took pleasure in watching that.",
        "So my question is, how much exposure and knowledge does the average North Korean citizen have of the outside world?",
        "See-Lig Harrison?",
        "Well, it's still a very tight ship.",
        "It is a police state and they do everything they can to keep out the kinds of outside influences that they think might lead to political trouble.",
        "But you can't keep it all out.",
        "And across that Chinese border - with refugee flows, and with cell phones, and with VCRs, and, you know…",
        "Do people in North Korea have cell phones and VCRs?",
        "No, people in North Korea don't necessarily have them - but some people are allowed to have them, actually.",
        "Foreigners in North Korea are now allowed to have them.",
        "There was a period when the number of people in the North Korean elite were allowed to have them.",
        "That was then clamped-down upon.",
        "But what I meant was that you can make connections because there are cell phones out in China and it's getting increasingly hard for them to keep out outside awareness of what's going on in the outside world.",
        "But what's fascinating is that the system inside the country, with the blessing of the leadership, has loosened up.",
        "And people, you know - it's like when Deng Xiaoping in China said it's glorious to get rich.",
        "Well, in North Korea it's no longer inglorious to get rich, although nobody's actually put it the way Deng Xiaoping did.",
        "And it's this change in the attitude toward making money, the fact that people are hustling for ways to take care of themselves in this - in what as Mike Said is an atmosphere of considerable privation, that I find the most remarkable change.",
        "And this - so we have a very anomalous situation.",
        "On the one hand, we see North Korea moving toward economic reforms, which we want them to do.",
        "At the same time, we see them battening down the hatches on the nuclear front and all this tension developing, which is leading to responses on our part that are stopping the flow of external influences into the country.",
        "These financial sanctions that I mentioned earlier, keep a factory that has a joint venture with a company in Sweden or Germany making widgets, from importing the stuff that you need to make widgets.",
        "And so that we say we're trying to open up North Korea to the outside world, but as one of the tragic consequences of this growth of attention, we're actively trying to bottle them up.",
        "On the other hand, you can visit like Mount of Gum Gang area as a tourist.",
        "And I think a lot of people, you know, visiting, you know, Gaesong industrial complex area, and so on and, so on.",
        "I think there are more traveling between two Koreas but it's not like you can just visit your family member in the North.",

        "Well, first of all, we have to understand in their history, I think going back to late 19th century.",
        "Mr. Harrison already talked about threat perception, and I think that's real, not only for North Korean but also South Korean people.",
        "If you look at in a Korean modern history, you have to remember that there were three major wars on the Korean peninsula.",
        "In 1894-5, Sino-Japanese War, and ten years later a war between Russia and Japan, and then Korean War in 1950.",
        "In all three major wars, you know, powers - Japan, China, Russia, U.S.",

        "Is there any special North Korean identity?",
        "Well, first of all, I think there are two different identities.",
        "One identity that both North Korea and South Korea share is ethnic identity.",
        "Okay.",
        "Both North and South Korean people, they share the belief that they belong to the same race, same Korean nation, same bloodline.",
        "So in that sense they are same, they are not different from each other.",

        "Is it going to be North or South.",
        "So in that sense, in terms of political identity, they are different and also they were contending to represent the whole ethnic Korean national community.",

        "But anyway, let's see if we can get a response from Ghee-Ouk Shin.",
        "Well, you know, first of all, you know, I think the literacy rate is very high.",
        "They are highly educated but at the same time, I still believe that ordinary people are, you know, quite isolated from the outside world.",
        "I believe that elite, they know what's going outside.",
        "When you talk to, you know, common people, I still believe that they have very limited information about outside world.",

        "Well, I think that they're very proud that they appear to have to been able to achieve this technical feat of exploding a nuclear weapon, although we don't really know yet.",
        "The government, Kim Jong Il and his, you know, they present this as a great achievement of the Korean people, something to be proud of.",
        "And, unfortunately, they have a lot of - they can make a plausible case to the people that the country is threatened.",
        "And that, against the background that we just heard discussed historically, is quite powerful.",
        "And, you know, the fact is that the present administration in Washington has had a division between people who want to negotiate, seriously, a denuclearization deal with North Korea in exchange for the normalization of relations between North Korea and the United States, which the North Koreans want.",
        "And people in the administration - starting with the president - who have said quite clearly, he said he would like to topple the Kim Jong Il regime.",
        "He loathes Kim Jong Il.",
        "So, you know, the government is able to use that.",
        "He once called Kim Jong Il a Pygmy.",
        "And, you know, the government is able to use that to present the picture to the people that the country is threatened and only the great leadership is saving them from another Korean war, from another Japanese invasion like the kind that led to colonialism.",
        "And so I think the answer to your caller is that the dangers, and the risks, and the recklessness that was demonstrated in the nuclear test is not seen that way by the people.",
        "And the government can say to them, look, the Americans won't even ratify the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and yet they're telling us we can't have a nuclear test.",
        "We've had one nuclear test and they've had 1,000, and they have 10,000 nuclear weapons.",
