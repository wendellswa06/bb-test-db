        "And it's very ironic that just during that period, when they begun to recognize that they have to open up in order to progress and they want to join the world, things have closed up because of the tensions between the United States and North Korea.",

        "You know, they are trying to open up in the sense that they want to open up in a controlled way - just as China did.",

        "So they're trying to find ways to open up gradually while keeping politic control.",
