        "So had to go with plan B, which was to be an intelligence officer, which I have to admit has been almost as much fun as being a fighter pilot.",
        "But an Air Force recruit today might not need a plan B.",
        "Remote aircraft pilots don't need perfect vision.",
        "They don't have to worry about getting airsick.",
        "The job has become more popular with recruits.",
        "In fact, the Air Force now has a career path specifically for drone pilots.",
        "They're still looking for the same qualities: spatial awareness, quick critical thinking skills.",
        "Still, flying drones is different.",
        "Unlike a person that deploys to combat, our remotely piloted aircraft force never leave combat.",
        "And that's got unique psychological stresses.",
        "You really don't get a break.",
        "And even more jarring is you do leave your ground control station and drive home and you have to mow the lawn.",
        "Because at least when you're deployed or in a combat zone, everyone is aware that you've endured this.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And this group of pilots doesn't have that built-in support.",
        "Well, they've still got the built-in support of their fellow airmen that are conducting the mission.",
        "The difference is you never leave the combat zone.",
        "I mean, we've got a Predator pilot that hasn't left the skies of Southwest Asia for nine years.",
        "We've got an international...",
        "What does that mean?",
        "Someone has been sitting somewhere...",
        "Someone has been - this captain has been sitting at Creech Air Force Base, flying over Southwest Asia eight to 10 hours a day, five to six days a week, 52 weeks a year for the past nine years.",
        "It's a lot of unique stressors that you put on this type of force.",
        "But the overwhelming advantage we get to the Air Force is that if you want to go and talk to a world expert on Iraq or Afghanistan, maybe you don't need to go to Iraq or Afghanistan, maybe you need to talk to that young captain down at Creech because they've been staring at that ground for the past nine years.",
        "So that seat, the one you could potentially sit in for nine years, what does that feel like?"

        "It is possible to over-control the aircraft or to lose your situational awareness and put the airplane into an unrecoverable situation.",
        "An unrecoverable situation, as in the plane goes down, but the pilot isn't injured because he's in front of a computer in New Mexico.",
        "There is physical and psychological distance between the pilot and the plane.",
        "And Peter Singer says that distance is changing the way we think about war.",

        "But we carried out 146 airstrikes, including the one that helped get Gadhafi in the end.",
        "And the point here is that engaging in combat and people being at risk have always been together until now.",
        "The technology allows you to disentangle them, and now a new age of war has started.",
        "And the big question is, how much more automated will war become?",
        "Singer says there are dozens of other countries that are at different stages of developing their own drone technology.",
        "Will there be a time when air-to-air combat is fully automated?",
        "General Poss says maybe.",
        "But I always see a human making that final call on whether or not that is a legitimate target, and I certainly always see a human making the call on whether or not to release a weapon on that target."
