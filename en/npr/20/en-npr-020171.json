        "When NPR's Farai Chideya spoke with Nancy Sims, president of the Toigo Foundation, she asked Sims what pushed people of color out of these firms.",
        "Primarily it's one of feeling of disconnect with the organization and that comes often by way of lack of access to, I think, improminent(ph) deal flow - things that really measure performance and talent and potential - not being heard and not having a voice that moves up within the organization to understand clearly what it takes in terms of performance, and connections to move ahead.",
        "And feeling of being passed over for opportunities, particularly for promotion.",
        "And there's certainly a lack of alignment with compensation, and in clarity around what it takes to get the types of increases and the promotional opportunities that an individual is deserving of.",
        "Now, your foundation deals directly with people who are moving into Wall Street jobs and financial service jobs.",
        "How does what you do keep them from falling off of the edge and getting marginalized?",
        "The Toiga Foundation made a commitment about five years ago that our job was not simply to identify students who were attending business school and pursing careers in finance, but really to be a partner with them once they were in the finance industry.",
        "So we provide on going career counseling and support.",
        "We serve as advocates where appropriate, and we also provide an ongoing leadership development curriculum."

        "Are there ever things that happened that aren't just a matter of who gets mentoring in the workplace, but also just how people are perceived in terms of their relative power and what you can ask of them?",
        "I think ultimately what were supporting is a group of individuals who are bringing anywhere from three to five years pre-MBA experience.",
        "They're graduating from the top institutions in the country, and they're very focused on their careers once they're in finance.",
        "The issue really at hand for Toigo participants, has been that they've succeeded over that three to four years of entry-level opportunity, and now they want to know what's the next step to move forward.",

        "What sorts of numbers are there in African-American participation in these key jobs?",
        "For the Toigo population that is the predominate group, and certainly, for the survey, that was our largest respondent pool of roughly 60 percent.",
        "I would say that one of the areas where we encourage all of the Toigo participants, but specifically for African-Americans, to really build their networks.",
        "I think that that is the most critical area of growth and support that many has failed to exercise to the fullest.",
        "The absence of having that on a consistent basis has led to, I think, the numbers for African-Americans to be much lower than desired.",
