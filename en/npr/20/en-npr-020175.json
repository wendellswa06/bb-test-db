        "Who is it?",
        "Well, what about season two?",
        "Not only are you going to get the wonderful Charisma Carpenter, who is the most beautiful actress with the greatest sense of irony about herself in all of television, opening a big suitcase full of money to tempt Veronica's father, so he leaves her standing at the airport when they're supposed to go off to New York…"
