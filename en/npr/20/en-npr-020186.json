        "It's because that's what AIG agreed to do.",
        "Many executives have employment contracts that specify a formula for computing their annual bonuses.",
        "Generally, the bonus formulas are determined by the company's board of directors.",

        "Employee bonuses have their roots in Christmas.",
        "In the 19th century, many employers offered a year-end bonus in the form of a gift.",
        "A turkey was a popular one.",
        "In the early 20th century, most large employers converted those bonuses to cash, often based on a percentage of an employee's annual salary.",
        "The practice had become widespread by 1952, when the National Labor Relations board ruled that a Christmas bonus qualified as wages rather than a gift, as long as it was paid at the same time and in a predictable amount every year.",
        "In today's corporations, performance-based bonuses have increasingly replaced Christmas bonuses.",
        "While Wall Street bonuses sank by 44 percent last year, the total payout was still the sixth highest ever, at more than $18 billion.",
        "In addition to bonuses for top executives, most companies grant bonus pools to managers for distribution to their subordinates.",
        "Some companies pay lower-tier employee bonuses on a purely discretionary basis, meaning that the company can decide not to pay a bonus with no legal consequences.",
