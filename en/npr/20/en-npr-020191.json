        "And let's talk first about the time table.",
        "How long do you figure you could use these extraordinary measures to avoid default?",
        "Well, extraordinary measures have different value at different times of the year and because we're now at a time of year when there are relatively few things that can be deferred and an awful lot of bills to pay, particularly tax refunds that come in February, there will be a much shorter period than people have been accustomed to in the past.",
        "Our current estimates are that at the end of February, we will run out of borrowing capacity, even using extraordinary measures.",

        "In other words, you wouldn't agree to concessions in exchange for raising the debt limit.",
        "But I want to ask you about that because back in 2011, the White House did agree to big spending cuts as part of a deal that did lift the debt ceiling.",
        "So I wonder if now, looking back, you would say that was a mistake, to tie the two things together, that it now sets a precedent.",
        "If you did it then, why not do it now?",
        "Well, since then, we've seen on a number of occasions, Congress has voted to extend borrowing authority without there being any other kinds of policies being attached to it.",
        "Let's remember that just a few weeks ago, at the end of last year, Congress enacted a budget, a two-year blueprint.",
        "Just a few days ago, Congress enacted an appropriations bill pursuant to that two-year budget, and now the question is will we pay the bills that that budget calls to be racked up.",
        "I think that the notion that after Congress passes a budget to then demand additional budget cuts in order to pay the bills that were already incurred, it doesn't make any sense.",
        "But that is what the White House agreed to back in 2011.",
        "So would you say that was a mistake?",
        "No.",
        "In 2011, there was no budget in place.",
        "In 2011, you know, we were at a point of substantial disagreement on budget policy and I think that if you look at what happened in 2011 and then in subsequently last year, we were seeing a number of members basically saying if they don't get their way, it would be better to default than to extend the debt limit.",

        "He says that although scientists can't predict quakes, they're getting close to knowing how big one will be the moment it hits.",
