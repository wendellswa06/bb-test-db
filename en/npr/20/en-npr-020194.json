        "Officer Polanco said his supervisors did not think breaking up fights, ending domestic disputes, and other police duties were as important as the numbers.",
        "In cross-examination, the city's lawyers tried to show that in Polanco's monthly reports - from January through August of 2009 - he had never fulfilled this quota and he was not punished in any way.",
        "But later, he was suspended with pay over a different incident and his case is still being reviewed.",
        "Darius Charney is a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights that brought the class action suit.",
        "Even if you discredit officer Polanco, the recordings say what they say.",
        "And you hear actual supervisors on these recordings, you know, saying this is mandatory, it's not negotiable; you need to do this, if you don't do it, you know, find yourself another job."
