        "Finally, I mean you and I have talked about Trump's poor approval ratings.",

        "You have to understand, the real estate lobby is a powerful force here in Washington.",
        "And so as a consequence, the tax code is quite generous to real estate professionals.",
        "Well, how much could this have benefited Trump, himself, in the long run?",
        "Well, the tax code at the time allowed Trump to stretch out losses for up to 18 years.",
        "So even if he made, say, $50 million a year for almost two decades, he could have had no tax liability.",
        "Now, Scott, many of us regular folks, we pay federal income taxes.",
        "And a lot of people complain about how expensive that is, how much comes right out of their paycheck.",
        "So what is the political liability for not paying income tax?",
        "Well, Trump supporters don't think this is a political liability for him.",
        "His campaign has not denied that Trump escaped paying income taxes.",
        "And if he did, his surrogates defend the idea.",
        "This is how Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani responded yesterday when he was asked about The New York Times story on ABC's \"\"This Week.",

        "We should get that straight immediately.",
        "This is a perfectly legal application of the tax code, and he would've been a fool not to take advantage of it.",
        "That's an echo of what Trump himself said in last week's debate when Hillary Clinton suggested he might have escaped paying taxes.",
        "And Trump interjected, that makes me smart.",
        "Democrats aren't so sure ordinary taxpayers will see it that way.",
        "Well, just briefly, how did Trump run up those losses of nearly $916 million?",
        "Well, we don't know for sure because the tax document leaked to The Times doesn't include that detail.",
        "It is certainly a valid question to ask how a presidential candidate, whose main qualification for office is the notion that he's a gifted businessman, could have lost nearly a billion dollars.",
        "Of course, Trump could answer that question by releasing his complete tax returns.",

        "Europeans made this offer back in June and since then the U.N.",
        "Security Council's been involved as well.",
        "Yeah, that's right Scott.",
        "The Europeans offered a bunch of incentives, economic incentives and technological incentives to the Iranians if they would suspend uranium enrichment.",
        "That was in early June.",
        "The Iranians then said, well, we're going to take a couple of months to look at this and try to understand what's in it and we'll respond by August 22nd.",
        "At that point there was some impatience on the part of Western leaders, particularly President Bush, who said publicly that he did understand why it would take so long.",
        "But in fact the Iranians took quite a long time.",
        "They were dealing with the five permanent members of the Security Council, plus Germany.",
        "And those nations got impatient and at the end of July passed a formal resolution in the Security Council in effect demanding that Iran stop uranium enrichment.",
        "The Iranians ignored that - in fact, some Iranian leaders said that was illegal - and then they responded this past week, on August 22nd, to the original European proposal of incentives from back in early June.",
        "We don't know precisely what the Iranians have said, but it appears that they didn't address the key issue as defined by the Security Council now, which is the demand to suspend uranium enrichment.",
        "So it's a somewhat muddled diplomatic situation right now, and all of the other nations that were dealing with Iran are trying to figure out what to do.",
        "Was the delay a stalling tactic or do you sense - have you been told that, in fact, there's some disagreement among the Iranian leadership about how to respond?",
        "There's no question that there was disagreement among the Iranian leadership about how to respond.",
        "There are a lot of different power centers in Iran and there are differing opinions.",
        "Some of those actually may have wanted to string this out in order to delay.",
        "But I've been told by someone who's close to the Iranian leadership that moderates have now seized control of this issue and they put forward some real responses to the European incentive package and they're hoping that the nations that they're dealing with will respond positively."
