        "And does - and your counterpart, is there anything you can tell us about what he said?",
        "Yes.",

        "Obviously, Western Europe - we've seen some terrible attacks in France, in Brussels.",

        "You talk about defeating ISIS.",
        "You've got to talk about some - a real place.",
        "It's Raqqa, Syria, and also the city of Mosul.",
        "Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq are our two primary objectives because they're large cities.",
        "And in the case of Raqqa, this is the self-proclaimed capital of the self-proclaimed caliphate.",
        "And...",
        "So what's the plan?",
        "Well, the plan will be to take Raqqa away from them and make sure that there aren't - isn't any ISIL planning done there.",
        "It's important to show that there cannot be and will not be an Islamic State based upon this ideology.",
        "In answer to your question about inspiration or direction, you see both.",
        "Sometimes you see direction of attacks in other countries coming out of Raqqa or Mosul.",
        "Sometimes it's just the inspiration.",
        "It's just the idea that there's this thing called this Islamic State.",
        "But either way, it's important that we destroy the fact of and the idea of an Islamic State.",

        "Russia came into the conflict on the side of the Assad regime.",
        "If the Pentagon coordinates airstrikes with the Russians, would this not help Bashar al-Assad stay in power?",
        "Well, that's not in the cards at the moment.",
        "What we're discussing with the Russians is the possibility - which still only remains a possibility - that they will begin to do, in fact, what they said they were going to do when they first intervened in Syria.",
        "What they said they were going to do was promote a transition away from Assad and therefore toward the end of the civil war, which started this whole thing.",
        "And then they said they were going to fight the terrorists, but that's not what they've done.",
        "They've instead propped up Assad in fighting the moderate opposition.",
        "Pulling Russia away from attacking Western-backed rebels, when it chooses to do that, and getting it focused on ISIL - will there potentially be a partnership at that very moment in time?",
        "There's the same.",
        "No, well, we'd always - we have our differences with Russia.",
        "And obviously, Syria is one.",
        "Ukraine is another.",
        "At the same time, we stand ready to work with Russia, as with others around the world, where our interests coincide and overlap.",
        "So, for example, the Russians worked with us on the Iranian nuclear deal.",
        "They've worked on us in some aspects of nonproliferation affecting North Korea.",
        "So there are areas where we found it's possible.",
        "But up to now in Syria - and we'll see about the future - they have been more intent on operating in ways that are not consistent with our interests than in ways consistent with our interest.",
        "So we'll see what the future holds."

        "And you're right, the president has constantly assessed and adjusted what we're doing there in consideration of the conditions.",
        "So if you like, he took out a little extra insurance policy on the success of the Afghan security forces and, therefore, asked us to make some adjustments.",

        "After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, there was European support - however halting - for the U.S.-led war effort.",

        "One is, how long will it last?",
        "If the vaccine only lasts a few years -let's say three years - then a young, adolescent girl - say, an 11-year-old, like your daughter - might not get much protection when she reaches the age of her peak of sexual activity, which hopefully will be more than three years from now.",
