        "And why is that important?",
        "Well, the sweat is removing heat.",
        "Meaning, when you sweat and then the sweat evaporates, that act of evaporation pulls heat away from your skin.",
        "When water on your skin turns to gas, the heat gets removed.",
        "So you sweat some more, then there's more evaporation.",
        "And as long as you keep up this sweating, evaporating, sweating, evaporating, the air right round your skin never gets too hot because evaporation protects you.",
        "So that tiny, thin layer of air right next to your skin - maybe it's only a millimeter or so - that little space is being cooled.",
        "And that's what keeps you from burning or boiling?",
        "Yeah, by your body temperature, by the evaporating water, we can cool the whole body through the sweating.",
        "But what happens if you can't sweat?",
        "Well, to find that out without doing anybody serious harm, Sir Charles brought a chicken egg - chicken eggs, after all, don't sweat - into the room with him.",
