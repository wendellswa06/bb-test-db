        "I try to make it flow.",
        "You know, it's just like reading a book.",
        "Just a regular story.",
        "You know, you just can't have one idea, and then you jump to another one.",
        "I try to make it flow coherently.",
        "That sense of structure made Dameron the most important arranger of the bebop era, says biographer Paul Combs.",
        "Tadd brings this larger compositional framework into bop where a lot of the boppers were just about, let's play the tune and set off some fireworks and play the next tune, you know?",
        "Much more care in all of that.",
        "And that's a big, big influence.",

        "Dameron formed his own band and hired the best players of the younger generation, including trumpeter Miles Davis, who went on to use some of Dameron's ideas in his groundbreaking \"\"Birth of the Cool\"\" sessions.",
        "But like so many of his colleagues in the post-war era, Tadd Dameron became addicted to heroin.",
        "In 1958, he was busted.",

        "Gitler says while Dameron was in prison, he kicked his habit.",
        "When he came back to New York, I ran into him.",
        "And we were talking, and he came up to my apartment.",
        "I had a piano.",
        "You know, we really connected.",
        "He was a very mellow, beautiful man.",
        "A man who had been through a lot.",
        "In a 1947 interview in Metronome magazine, Tadd Dameron said: There's enough ugliness in the world.",
        "I'm interested in beauty.",
        "That was the whole point of Dameron's arrangements, says biographer Paul Combs.",
        "Even when the harmonies are very advanced, he's never drawing attention to that.",
        "They're all at the service of making this beauty that he wants to put out in the world as a balm for the ugliness and strife.",

        "Ira Gitler put it this way:",
        "Well, his melodies were so beautiful, but at the same time, they swung.",
        "He was airborne to me.",
        "You know, he was in the heavens before he got there.",
        "Tadd Dameron got to the heavens all too soon.",
        "When he died from cancer on March 8th, 1965, he was just 48 years old.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Tom Vitale in New York.",

        "Well, it's not just musicians who I don't think are extreme.",
        "I think the whole way we define extremism is very problematic.",
        "That's one of the things I learned from this book.",
        "You know, when you look at al-Qaeda and you call them radicals, really nothing much that al-Qaeda's advocating, and its use of violence, none of that is really new.",
        "What's really radical are the Muslims, just like the people in the West, some of them, who are trying to actually bring together these two cultures which seem to be in conflict, and create something that's not just new, but somehow greater than the sum of the parts."

        "No, you can see this also in Egypt.",
        "You know, one of the most developed rock and hard-rock scenes in the world is in Pakistan, which is the second largest Muslim country, which has, you know, the most developed music-video scene, and the bands there also can be very hard, but also blend together local styles.",
        "So, this is what surprised me.",
        "Because when I first heard about metal in the Middle East, I kind of thought the same thing, that this would be something that was just in the margins, just perhaps in more liberal societies.",
        "But even in a country like Iran, where there's no - really, metal is not allowed at all in a public way, there's a big underground scene.",
        "And you know, you see kids who might wear, you know, a full head scarf outside.",
        "Then they go to someone's house, they take it off, and they're listening to really hardcore metal.",

        "It's underground, you say.",
        "Why?",
        "I mean, is it suppressed?",
        "Well, certainly, you know, you can't really generalize it all from country to country.",
        "Many of the countries, from Morocco to Pakistan, have had what you could call satanic metal affairs in the last decade, where the government has brought charges against musicians and fans for, you know, listening to satanic music and being Satan worshipers.",
        "You know very - really, almost comical, if you actually look at the charges.",
        "But you know, in countries like Iran, it's clearly proscribed, right?",
        "But there's a big underground scene.",
        "In a country like Morocco, which had a metal - a satanic metal scare in 2003, the kids actually fought back.",
        "They fought against the guilty verdicts.",
        "They staged, you know, metal concerts outside the courthouse, and overturned the verdicts, and then metal became much bigger.",
        "And then you have countries like Egypt, where the Grand Mufti, actually, declared that the metal heads who were arrested in the scare there in 1997 should be executed as apostates if they don't repent.",
        "There it took a lot longer, but now it's become - it's become popular again.",
        "It's come out of the closet, so to speak, and kids are - there're actually concerts inside Cairo, in clubs in Cairo, where only two years ago, they had to be held in villas out in the desert where no one knew they were there and no one really cared what they did.",

        "What does your guest have to say about that?",
        "Mark LeVine?",
        "Well, I think, actually, this is actually a great circle that's coming back.",
        "You know, if you listen to the music of American slaves, African -American slaves, most of them came from West Africa, and a good share of them were Muslims.",
        "And there's strong evidence that a lot of the tonality and the melodies that became blues and gospel and eventually rock came out of variations of Muslim calls to prayer, right?",
        "And then you think of bands from the '60s, like Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones, who went to Morocco and other Arab countries.",
        "So, that - they really influenced our music.",
        "Then, we start influencing their music, and now, they're coming and taking that kind of metal and remixing it with their own local music traditions and creating something new.",
        "So, this is something that's really gone on for 30, 40 years.",
        "Most of the older musicians I've met, you know, laugh at me when I approach them thinking that this is something new.",
        "They've been doing this for longer than I've been alive.",

        "Well, not only is it the most - perhaps the most popular, you actually can find fans of the band in Jordan and Saudi Arabia who have tattooed the band's logo to their bodies, which is sort of a double violation of traditional Islamic law.",
