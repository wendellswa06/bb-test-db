        "We love them.",
        "And when I got there, I understood why, because, you know, the lead guitarist's parents come from Libya and Iraq.",
        "They are Jews who immigrated from Libya and Iraq.",
        "He grew up immersed in Arab culture and speaking Arabic.",
        "They called the band Orphaned Land, because they felt this holy, sacred land, Israel-Palestine, has been forsaken and abandoned by the two peoples who are fighting over it and using the most unsacred, you know, ways to try to secure control of it.",
        "And I think metal heads across the region identify with that, because they feel orphaned by their society.",
        "How do they get access to the music?",
        "I mean, Orphaned Land is a band in Israel.",
        "How do kids in Saudi Arabia get to hear it?",
        "Well, there's two ways.",
        "First, certainly, the Internet now makes any kinds of censorship almost impossible, right?",
        "But the second way is through festivals.",
        "Orphaned Land actually just played at a festival in Istanbul, where, you know, Israelis often play in Istanbul, and metal fans from the Arab world will go there to meet them.",
        "So, there are spaces - and also there're huge metal festivals like Wacken in Germany.",
        "So, there are ways that bands can meet up both virtually, online, and also in reality, and they forge these kind of connections.",
        "And when you think about Muslim - I mean, religious Muslim kids who pray five times a day, but also their favorite metal band is Orphaned Land, because they were the first band to blend in oriental, quote, unquote, elements into brutal death metal, which is why you heard that kind of screamed vocals.",
        "That's what makes it death metal.",
        "You know, that inspired them, and the fact that it's an Israeli doing it, really, they don't care.",
        "They're not thinking in the same kind of paradigms that their parents are, you know, and that the older Islamists are.",
        "And the more interesting thing is even the younger religious kids, who we might think are more conservative, like younger members of the Muslim Brotherhood, or in Morocco, they're also - they don't care so much anymore about these kind of older political conflicts.",
        "They're much more interested in democracy, in pluralism, in tolerance.",
        "So, this is a real sea change in this emerging generation of the Muslim world, and the book attempts to tell that story in a way that probably hasn't been done before.",
        "That's fascinating.",
        "You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And Sabur (ph) is on the line with us from Scottsdale, Arizona.",
        "Sabur, I hope I pronounced that correctly.",
        "Yep, that is correct.",
        "Welcome to the show.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I grew up in Pakistan.",
        "I spent the first 16 years over there in 1990s, and back then, it was pretty much just the mainstream pop music when I was growing up, and there was only, like, a couple of media channels that they were nationally available.",
        "But since I've come here, because of Pervez Musharraf, he's opened up the media, and also, Internet has really spread out.",
        "I came here in 2001, and I started an underground band website for a friend of mine.",
        "He was in Pakistan and he had an underground band, heavy metal band, and he wanted me to put it on the Internet.",
        "And since then, since 2001, it has - I have over 300-plus underground bands all from Pakistan and India that have sprung up since then.",
        "I mean, I grew up - I was a teenager in - when I was in Pakistan, but I never ever heard any underground bands.",
        "So, Internet has really, really helped grow the underground music in Pakistan and India."

        "Mark LeVine, Internet, as well, in other parts of the Islamic world?",
        "Certainly, Internet is key, but Pakistan is a really unique place, and in some way, a harbinger of, I think, how the music business is going to develop.",
        "You know, first of all, I was up in Peshawar, which is the home base, of course, of the Taliban, and every day, you know, you can read in the New York Times or Washington Post, what have you, stories of how the Taliban is spreading throughout the northwest frontier province and Peshawar.",
        "President Arroyo's political allies have vowed to block the motion, but any such effort, says political analyst Manuel Quezon III, must be handled carefully if Arroyo is to avoid a repeat of the people power protests that toppled the dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, and, in 2001, President Joseph Estrada.",
        "But is also, you know, one of the best rock bands in Pakistan, Sajid and Zeeshan, are there, you know, and there's a great music scene there, and a great liberal tradition in Peshawar, which was, in many ways, destroyed by the war in - the first war against the Soviets in Afghanistan.",
        "But it's still trying to survive there.",
        "And what you have in Pakistan, starting in the '90s, is bands like Janoon and other bands, really taking this kind of cheesy Pakistani pop, adding in elements of really hard American and British and European rock, and creating this incredible new hybrid, which has just taking the world by storm, in India, too.",
        "And so, now, you have Pakistani musicians and India musicians constantly going - playing in each other's countries and working together, and that's clearly culturally breaking the ice between India and Pakistan.",
        "But the other interesting thing is that in Pakistan now, because of the ubiquity of cheap but very high-quality recording technologies, anyone can basically record a professional song - sounding song for 2,000 dollars.",
        "Shoot a video for another 2,000.",
        "Send it to one of the dozen music video channels.",
        "If they like it, they'll play it.",
        "And if it starts getting requested, all of a sudden, you're famous.",
        "And then the music business industry will come and buy your album.",
        "And so this kind of do-it-yourself ethos is really symbolic of the music scenes across the Middle East, and it's, I think, it's one of the, you know, models that we should learn from here, but it's also one of the ways they're combating their own kind of globalized, corporatized music scene, with companies like Rotana and other huge conglomerates, which are trying to stifle music and make it into, you know, cookie-cutter music, the same way as happened in the U.S.",
        "So there's very interesting similarities in the struggles, and we could be learning from them, rather than what we assume, which is usually the other way around.",
        "Sabur, thanks so much for the call.",
        "Thank you, guys.",
        "In the remaining moments we have left, Mark LeVine, I wanted to ask you about this notion over the battle for the soul of Islam.",
        "And I've seen some of the work you've written, and you write, in that battle for the soul of Islam, I would put my money on Ozzy - of course, Ozzy Osborne - over Osama.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Well, you know, if you have a historical memory, and I'm a historian, you think of the Eastern Bloc.",
        "If you think of when Ozzy and other metal heads appeared in the Soviet Union in its last days and heralded the fall of Communism, or you think about the Czech bands like the Plastic People and other bands that heralded the reforms in Czechoslovakia, you know, when I see who the real radicals are, and the kids who are really willing to put themselves out on the line and want to change their society in a positive way, it's the kids who are not just metal heads - not everyone likes metal - but who have that kind of attitude, that kind of attitude which is going to challenge authority, but in a positive way, you know?",
        "For these kids, one person said, you know, metal is a music about death, but for us, it's a music that affirms life.",
        "It's that positive attitude which is really the thing that gives me hope in an otherwise fairly hopeless situation."
