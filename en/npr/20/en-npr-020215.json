        "The world's oceans are rising up about eight inches on average over the past century.",
        "The seas are rising more in some places than others.",
        "As NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, scientists are beginning to predict where the rise will be most severe.",
        "A warming climate is melting a lot of glaciers and ice sheets on land.",

        "The water doesn't rise uniformly.",
        "To understand why, think of the Earth as a spinning top with a bit of a wobble.",
        "Eric Larour, who studies the planet's frozen regions, says that when huge ice sheets - some 2 miles thick - start to melt, it affects the Earth's rotation."

        "That's part of the story, but something else happens, too.",
        "Many ice sheets and glaciers are so massive they exert a significant gravitational field, almost as if they were small versions of the moon.",
        "The force is tiny, but it does attract nearby ocean water.",
        "So what happens when the ice melts is that there is less of it.",
        "And so the ocean recedes away from the mass of ice.",
        "Larour's team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab has mapped how changes in these giant ice fields influence sea levels both nearby and thousands of miles away.",
        "They published their results in the journal Science Advances.",
        "For example, the ocean along Norway's coast could actually drop a tiny bit if nearby ice sheets in eastern Greenland melt.",
        "Meanwhile, those Greenland ice sheets could raise sea levels by inches on the other side of the planet in places like Tokyo.",
        "Larour says this is useful information.",
        "Out of all the masses of ice around the Earth - Alaska glaciers, Greenland, Antarctica, Patagonia, Himalaya - which ones are going to be contributing to sea level in New York?",
        "It turns out that in New York City, the sea level would be affected more by melting ice on the northern end of Greenland than from ice in Canada.",
        "Scientists are now using this information to predict the future for American cities.",

        "He says NOAA is putting together a sea level rise grid for the country.",
        "So it really matters when you go to start planning on, I'm going to be prepared for 1 meter of sea level rise.",
        "Well, you might really want to be prepared for 4 to 5 feet.",
        "One thing's for certain.",
        "Once you wait until you realize you have a problem, it's going to be chronic rather quickly."

        "What is going on is that we have 10 or a dozen Republicans meeting behind closed doors determining the future of one-sixth of the American economy.",
        "What we do know is that it is going to be largely based on the disastrous House bill which passed last month, which threw 23 million Americans off of health insurance, raised premiums for older workers, defunded Planned Parenthood and which would give enormous tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country while cutting Medicaid by over $800 billion.",
        "So we think that the Senate bill is being worked on based on the House bill that there will be some changes, but I have no reason to believe that it will not be a disastrous piece of legislation.",
        "You wrote last week in an op-ed in The New York Times - and I'm quoting here - \"\"too many in our party cling to an overly cautious centrist ideology.\"\" Do you think that applies specifically in this case to health care?",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "I mean, I think that Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, took us a step forward.",
        "It provided health insurance for over 20 million more Americans.",
        "That's no small thing.",
        "It did away with the obscenity of pre-existing conditions and a number of other essential health care benefits that are now guaranteed to the American people.",
        "So it made some real change.",
        "But, Rachel, at the end of the day, the American people in Congress have got to ask themselves a very simple question.",
        "Why are we the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right?",
        "Why do we pay double per capita for health care compared to any other major country?",
        "Why do we pay the highest prices in the world by far for prescription drugs?",
