        "And you've now had the chance not merely to play with him on a couple of tunes, but a collaboration.",
        "This is something else.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It really is fun.",

        "Actually.",
        "That was - that's actually more fun to me, because in live concerts what we do is we take the material that we composed for the recording and we stretch it out and we improvise, which is what brings joy to both of us.",
        "Yeah, really fun.",
        "It's crazy.",
        "The record was, you know, we put together this record.",
        "It was really a great way to learn the material and create a way to play together as duo partners.",
        "And it really came together and we made a real effort to keep the tunes really concise and straight to the point.",
        "But we don't feel that way when it comes time to do a live performance.",
        "That's the place to explore the details and the different opportunities that they present.",
        "So that's what we do and we just take it out.",

        "But Chick said, hey, let's record and mix it in seven days.",
        "So that meant recording a lot faster.",
        "But the truth is I'm used to, like, maybe taking too much time sometimes to make records and getting obsessive about the details.",

        "But those are things, when I look back at my life, they're the things I'm the most proud of, is those moments when I had to rise to the occasion.",

        "I felt we had a real happy - we stuck a real happy medium, because I grew up actually the opposite in recording, which is, you know, come to the studio pretty well prepared.",
        "A lot of the music is very improvisational.",
        "I do one or two takes and get out.",

        "A lot of great stuff happens that way.",

        "But we found a happy medium, because Bela really took charge of making the recording become concise and have good arrangements and...",

        "Chick Corea, why don't you start that out first?",

        "We balance each other's instrument just naturally, you know.",

        "Is that what you're doing?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think - well, you just - I have a theory that whatever number of musicians or whatever combination of instruments is, you're trying to make the music sound complete.",
        "So if there's two people, you play it differently than larger groups.",
        "You play a lot less in larger groups.",
        "And then you just use your ears and your consciousness to figure out what's needed and what you can supply.",
        "And that's, I think, what we both tried to do.",
        "And you might really - it was particularly spontaneous, because that's the first time we've seen each other since February - was the last time we played.",
        "And we just met here and we're trying to remember some of these arrangements.",
        "So we're relying a lot on spontaneous, you know, a lot of good listening to each other in figuring out what's - what would be good to do.",
