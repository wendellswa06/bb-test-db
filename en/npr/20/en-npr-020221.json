        "It's very confusing, but it's played in a style that I play it with, with three fingers that revolve around those five strings on the right hand and pluck out, you know, patterns.",
        "So they have a very different sound.",
        "And a lot of the sound of the style of banjo that I play has to do with the notes ringing in to each other.",
        "And the choices of the open and closed strings and the way you let notes ring, where I think tenor banjo tends to be different, a lot of voicings up the neck what you strum up to, and very much about the flat pick and the sounds you get.",
        "Also, there's some great Irish music played on the tenor banjo, and a lot of cool music.",
        "So...",
        "Do you fool around with that?",
        "That's the shortest possible..."
