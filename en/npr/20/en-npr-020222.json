        "It's hard to pluck a piano.",
        "But the truth is bluegrass is a music that really came together around Bill Monroe and Flat and Scruggs, and some other great musicians around the Grand Ole Opry at a time when you stood and play in front of the mics.",
        "And it was built around a folk kind of music that really didn't have piano in it.",
        "So we have two more to go through.",
        "First, Rev.",
        "Samuel Rodriguez - what can you tell us about him?",
        "But as bluegrass really was considered country music at the time, there were times when bluegrass musicians would have pianos and drums and accordions and the other instruments that were around Nashville on records.",
        "It just wasn't really part of the music as Bill Monroe started it.",
        "But you know, it can be.",

        "Actually, Bruce Hornsby just did a record with Ricky Skaggs that's real cool, which is incorporating piano into it.",

        "It's a good blend.",
        "Chick Corea, let me ask you.",
        "There are so many diverse interests in your background, from Latin obviously, jazz, classical music of various types.",
        "Was there any exposure to bluegrass when we were growing up?",
        "Only through Bela, actually.",
        "Through the years that I've known him and we began to - I began to listen to the Flecktones and his music.",
        "And actually it wasn't so much the banjo that interested me as the music he was playing.",
        "But then through him, then I thought, especially on this project, actually, what happened is Bela brought this song that we played earlier on the show called \"\"Mountain.",
        "And I said, hey, you know, show me that exact lick.",
        "I want to play it on the piano.",
        "And so I tried to duplicate the banjo groove, sort of, on the piano.",
        "And I started getting interested in the groove and then he started showing me some other bluegrass music.",
        "I actually loved the groove and the feel of the music.",
        "So it's kind of like an introduction to me.",
        "One of the fun things about showing Chick that lick is just the stuff that came out of him.",
        "Because when he improvises on that song, he plays stuff - he kind of starts with the sound of that traditional banjo thing and then takes it on to the moon.",
        "So it's all the stuff that I wished I could think of to play.",
        "But then you can sort of see how it would work, you know.",
        "It's just cool."
