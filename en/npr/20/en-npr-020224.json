        "That is the significant thing that's happening.",

        "And Donald Trump has capitalized on that, has he not?",
        "He has.",
        "You know, and this is - for me, as a TV critic, this is sort of a double-edged sword, you know, because I think that the fragmenting of media has created a lot of great things.",
        "Media and television is more representative and inclusive and diverse than it used to be.",
        "But, you know, we also have this situation where everybody is in their own sort of little media bubble.",
