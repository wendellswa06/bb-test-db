        "And flooding might be putting it strongly, but what we're seeing - what we've been seeing today is some water lapping over the top of the restored levee there.",
        "The Army Corps of Engineers, at this point, has been reassuring us that it's just water splashing over the top.",
        "However, that said, there's a substantial amount of water that has splashed over the top.",
        "They say that there's still plenty of clearance and that they don't expect widespread flooding there.",
        "But they have - one difference between now and Katrina is that they have crews on site to monitor it and to take steps immediately if there's any threat of flooding.",

        "But all these issues like Jerusalem, like refugees, like final border, like settlements can be resolved, in fact, not by temporary action but by an agreement.",
        "For agreement, you need to negotiate, to start talking.",

        "And there was this flood of American corporations coming to China with the loss of work in the United States and transferred over here.",
        "And there is no doubt that these corporations are here - American corporations manufacturing at lower costs and exporting back to the United States.",
        "And the question is how do we affect that?",
        "The law was passed and these corporations are here.",
        "And obviously, many times it's the same corporations we have contracts with in the United States.",
        "Well now, let me ask about the reason, of course, that a lot of American labor unions have stayed away - the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which is government-controlled, which has not had the best reputation for protecting workers in the past.",
        "Have they changed?",
        "They've organized Wal-Mart, McDonalds.",

        "Are they legitimately representing the interests of Chinese workers now?",
        "We questioned them very, very carefully on that, as you know, it's one thing to have numbers, but do you really represent members like we do in the United States, where if somebody is fired, we get their job back?",

        "China's government is close to passing a new labor law which would give more rights to workers and a little less latitude to employers to - example - do mass firings.",

        "And isn't it funny, it's the same group that is opposing labor law reform in the United States because we're working very hard in the United States to get Employee Free Choice Act.",
        "Now, I want to ask, Mr. Hoffa, about the logic here and how this might - how a trip like yours might affect American workers.",
        "I suppose the logic is, China has very cheap labor, in some cases very poor working conditions.",
        "If the wages and working conditions were higher, then there would be less strict competition with American workers and maybe fewer lost American jobs.",
        "But I wonder, are wages so low in China that even if they doubled, say, you would still have much cheaper labor in China than in the United States?",
        "Well, I don't think that we should kid ourselves about the standard of living.",
        "There's a dramatic difference between the standard of living here of the average worker and what they make and what the people in the United States make.",
        "But any effort we can make to raise those wages, it does make our workers more competitive, and maybe it will keep some jobs in the United States."
