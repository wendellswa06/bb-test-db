        "So, you know, a lot of us, I think, frankly, almost all of us who are African-American, say, you know what, I need to, you know, each one teach one, lift somebody up, but when you're a judge, you have a very particular role, and it's a role where you are at somewhat of a remove, even though you're facing the defendants, you are not on the same level as them.",
        "How do you make sense of what Judge Arrington did?",
        "I understand what Judge Arrington did completely.",
        "And I have to tell you why.",
        "Though we must be removed, we are nonetheless human.",
        "It is the easiest thing in the world to do, is to be removed if you don't care.",
        "But if you have the nerve to care, and if you see what we see on a daily basis, his humanity and his caring came together that day and made him do something clearly he shouldn't have done.",
        "He knows that.",
        "But it was an error of the heart that I find fully condonable.",
        "So, what other ways, you know, you say that you approve of the sentiment, not necessarily of the execution.",
        "How else may he have gone about this?",
        "I think he could have said it in front of the white attorneys.",
        "In my courtroom, I, for a year and a half, wouldn't say anything directed towards a defendant that had anything to do with race because I felt it was inappropriate, but my second thought about it was, my job is to deal with this individual as best I can.",
        "And if I feel that I can touch him, reach him, get to him, by mentioning, dealing with or encompassing race in the conversation, I have an obligation to do so.",
        "And I can't worry about what white people are out there looking at me.",

        "One son was sick, and the other one wasn't going to school.",
        "And I had my three wonderful men at home, I'm not taking (unintelligible) them.",
        "And I got a third defendant there that day that was talking about how many babies he had with how many different black women.",
        "Not with, not only not with a sense of shame, but with a sense of accomplishment, and with the backdrop of my great men that I live with and there are so many great brothers out there who I wasn't taking care of, and this guy, the third guy that day that took pride in that which he was doing that was damaging his women and me.",
        "I took it personally.",
        "I got upset.",
        "I lost my composure.",

        "They have basically scooped almost every single gossip and mainstream news organization on celebrity breaking news.",
        "So everything from Michael Jackson's death, which they were the first to correctly report, to the footage of Solange Knowles attacking Jay Z just earlier this year, to the tapes of Donald Sterling that necessitated the sale of the Los Angeles Clippers.",
        "Now how do they manage to get their hands on this type of material that, you know, a lot of people would like to get a hold of?",
        "Harvey Levin has established a wide-ring of tipsters and has connections through many of his employees, relationships that funnel this information to him, but a lot of it is just that TMZ now is the place that people know to bring their information if they have something good.",
        "Now Harvey Levin says that they don't pay for interviews, they don't pay very much for things like this and actually claim that they did not pay for this footage, but it seems very clear that that's not the case.",
        "That it seems to be the case that they're paying for what they get?",
        "Yes, that they're paying - he says that it's a small amount, but, you know, within the industry it seems clear that it's at least five figures, for especially this sort of very valuable videotape.",
        "Now I have to say one thing I was kind of thrilled to read about in terms of their reporting practices is that TMZ puts money into good, old-fashioned investigative style, you know, reporting on the record, like with their court reporting.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, and this is the thing that I think a lot of people are hesitant to admit.",
        "They don't want to think of TMZ as investigative journalists in part because they don't heed some of the ethics that American journalism says are standard.",
        "So the fact that they pay for stories, I mean, in Britain people pay for stories - that's been a long tradition within the journalism schools there - but here in America I would say that, you know, they employ people who haven't necessarily gone to journalism school, but who dig and who do that sort of nitty-gritty style journalism that in some ways isn't funded in a lot of organizations anymore."
