        "One of the things that looked strange to me - and I was around doing cancer research in 1971, is the optimism because when - in 1971, we really didn't know very much about cancer.",
        "It was essentially a black box.",
        "We knew that there were tumors, and we knew that very toxic chemicals could cure some childhood leukemias or at least put them into remission.",
        "And there wasn't the kind of optimism that I feel today among my colleagues and - who feel they have a much deeper understanding of how cancer actually arises and how cancers differ one from the other in different organs, and how even within the same organ we have a much more detailed picture of what a cancer is.",
        "And we've had some successes based on the detailed understanding of how a cancer arises and how a cancer is sustained.",
        "Is there any mind-body connection in the literature between, you know, your mind influencing (unintelligible)?",

        "They took the city of Tikrit; they took the areas around it.",
        "And Human Rights Watch have analyzed video footage put out by the Islamic State of killings that happened in this area and they say now that they believe that, as you say, up to 770 men, very likely to have been members of the armed forces from the Speicher military base appear to have been killed at five different sites close to Tikrit.",
        "This would be one of the worst mass killings by the group, even as things stand.",

        "There were very few survivors known about, which does, I think make it hard to establish facts.",

        "The plan had been that they would address Parliament about their issues, but once they were there they began a violent protest.",
        "They smashed up parts of the building, assaulted the staff, all the politicians were hiding in their offices.",
        "And they then staged a sit-in in the meeting room where the Parliament usually gathers and they refused to leave until the speaker of Parliament negotiated with them, agreed to host them at a hotel nearby and hold a special session of Parliament just for them, today.",

        "But the defense minister and some senior generals were and they denied the charge of orders to withdraw and they promised to start an investigation.",

        "Right.",
        "I think it shows us that the takeover happened not just because the Islamic State was stronger, but because the Iraqi military was so weak and because of divides between the military and the civilian population.",

        "And to say, we still have these regional organizations like AQAP; they can pose a threat.",

        "He joined us via Skype from Istanbul, and we asked him what al-Qaida looks like today.",

        "So you have al-Qaida from Mali to Yemen to Pakistan to Afghanistan and, of course, in Iraq and Syria.",
        "It's very, very decentralized, and that is far more dangerous - in my opinion - than al-Qaida of Sept. 11.",

        "Well, that's actually an incredibly good question because right now, everyone is quite excited about targeted therapy, that is being able to design drugs or antibodies or other methods that are specifically tailored to either treat the product of a mutant gene or to take advantage of some physiological step like the generation of new blood vessels or manipulation of the immune system in very specific ways to treat cancers.",
        "But we have some cancers that we treat with drugs that we don't understand.",
        "For example, since the '70s, we've been able to treat testicular cancer, once a highly lethal cancer, especially young men in their teens and 20s and 30s, with a drug called Cisplatin that we still don't understand.",
        "In fact, one of the things we're trying to do at the Cancer Institute at the moment, despite the fiscal pressure we're under, is to draw people's attention to some really basic things we don't understand, like why does Cisplatin, a drug that doesn't work very well in many common cancers, work so well in the treatment of testicular cancer?",
        "And what other victories have we had in the road in the last 40 years?",
        "Well, I think the one that attracts the greatest attention needs to be mentioned first, is our treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, a situation - a disease in which we have known for 20 years or more that a specific gene called the abl gene, that makes an enzyme called tyrosene kynase, having a drug that interferes with the action of that mutant kynase can put the disease into remission.",
        "And as long as you take one or two pills a day orally, you can maintain that disease in a state of remission so that life expectancy for someone with that leukemia is the same as it would be without the leukemia.",
        "There are other examples of targeted therapies that work well but for a much shorter time because we encounter drug resistance quite quickly in the face of these therapies.",
        "But I think that the thing that we tend to hang our hat on in the realm of treatment - and we want to come back to prevention and diagnosis and other aspects in a moment - but in the realm of treatment, I think the fact that we have the tools now that allow us to analyze the genome, the set of chromosomal information in a cancer cell in so much detail, is giving us a lot of new ideas for treatments, and some of them are very successful, some less so, and others I think show promise that is driving our science in a very, very vigorous way.",

        "In those days, we knew one incredibly important fact that was very important in my own career, namely that there were viruses in animals that caused cancer, like the rous sarcoma virus of chickens or the meloni sarcoma virus of mice, and those viruses and many others that I won't mention were the tools that allowed us to understand the underlying genetic nature of human cancer."

        "But now, of course, we know that - and actually began to know in the '70s that there are viruses like the human hepatitis-B virus, the human papillomaviruses, and Epstein-Barr virus and several others, are important in cancer.",
        "And we have vaccines against some of these viruses, most importantly the vaccine against human hepatitis-B virus and the vaccine that protects against papillomaviruses that can make a tremendous difference in preventing cancer.",
        "Indeed, the big issue was getting those vaccines into the hands of people who need them, especially in developing countries, and that is a major issue for us.",
        "We're taking a big interest right now in cancer in developing countries, some of which have as much as half of their cancers attributable to infectious agents, not just viruses but bacteria like helicobacter that are causative agents of gastric cancer.",
        "Now talking about preventive medicine and taking these vaccines, but I'm thinking back, and I'm - you know, I guess two of the biggest preventable cancers, or we talk about them now, was smoking, right, and there's a huge amount of cancers caused by smoking, and in more recent years melanoma.",

        "And, you know, we've had some success in this country in reducing the rates of tobacco use to the point where about 20 percent or so of our population smokes.",
        "But that's still a very large percentage.",
        "And a very significant - an important point to make here about how we've done in dealing with cancer over the years is that over the last 20 years or so, the age-adjusted mortality rate for cancer has come down about one percent a year.",

        "There were actually more people killed in World War II, more Americans killed in World War II than dying of cancer each year, but the numbers were not so far off.",
        "But the important - and of course the American population has grown and has gotten older.",
        "So you might expect a lot more cancer, and indeed there is - there are more cancer deaths today than there were in Nixon's time.",
        "But if you look at the death rate, especially when it's age-adjusted, we've done very well in the last 20 years in bringing down the rates.",
        "Some of that reduction in death rate is due to a reduction in the use of tobacco products.",
        "But some is also due to improved surgeries, improved therapies.",
        "And numbers like this don't tell the whole story.",
        "That's very important to remember, that we've become much more skilled at controlling symptoms of cancer, at demystifying cancer as a disease by trying to explain it scientifically.",
        "The advocacy community has been very good at making cancer something that's not an object of shame so that people live and work - you know, cancer's still a difficult disease.",
        "It can be a terrible disease.",
        "But we've been much more - we've gotten much better at controlling symptoms and side effects and other aspects of cancer therapy.",
