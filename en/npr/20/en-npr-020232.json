        "OK.",
        "Thanks for calling.",
        "So the - there's no doubt that what we eat influences cancer rates, and I think probably the strongest evidence for that comes from a lot of historical epidemiological studies in which people are studied when they are in their country of origin and then when they move to other places - Japanese moving to America, Chinese moving to Hawaii and America.",
        "And there's no doubt that there are dramatic changes in cancer rates when that happens.",
        "One of the things we don't understand is what element of the environment and especially of diet is - can the change in rates be attributed to.",
        "But we - I heard about nitrosamines and things like that in processed meat.",
        "Yes.",
        "And that may be one factor that's important, and we have, of course, controlled the use of nitrosamines in meat.",
        "Right.",
        "So I think this is still a very important aspect of what we're - we need to understand about the environmental contributions to cancer rates.",
        "And indeed, the NCI has specifically asked that the scientific community to respond to some of these now historically significant observations about changes in cancer rates as people move from one area of the world to another in hopes of getting a clearer picture of what's happening.",
        "One of the things that may be helpful is our ability to look at the genomes of cancer cells because we know that the kinds of mutations that you see are reflections of so-called oncogenic cancer-causing agents.",
        "So tobacco smoke or UV radiation from sunlight have signatures that we can see when we examine the genomes of cancer cells, and those may be important in trying to focus our attention on things we eat.",

        "Is there any connection between obesity and cancer?",
        "There is definitely that connection.",
        "It's well-documented that obesity is a risk factor for many types of cancer, not equally across the board.",
        "Remember, there are lots of different kinds of cancer.",
        "Some of them affect cancer rates by as much as three- or fourfold, some less.",
        "It's estimated that if there were no obesity in America, we'd have about 20 percent fewer cancer deaths in this country.",
        "And yet we don't really understand what the connection is between obesity and cancer.",
        "One of the things that we're doing with our provocative questions exercise at the NCI is trying to draw people's attention to the fact that this relationship is a highly validated one and ask whether it's a change in inflammatory response or some hormonal effect of obesity that contributes to development of cancer.",
        "We are heartened to think that reversing obesity could reverse the high risk of cancer incidence and mortality, and that comes from studies in which people undergo extreme weight loss as a result of so-called bariatric surgery.",
        "So while those data are not definitive, they do suggest that you can reverse the risk within a few years, and that's encouraging."

        "We've always heard - I mean, over the years that I've been covering it there's always been the talk of the magic bullet, you know, the drug that will go right to the cancer and leave the healthy cells alone.",
        "And then, there's been talk about tweaking up the body's own immune system.",
        "Are we closer to any of those two types of fighting cancer?",
        "Well, no one of us believes in a magic bullet, but we do believe that - well, a magic bullet may not be the best possible metaphor, that there are drugs that will be selective for cancers and selective in two possible ways.",
        "One, directing a treatment absolutely at the cancer cells, and there are ways to think about that.",
        "Right.",
        "What's been more widely used are therapies that specifically affect cancer cells because cancer cells have a mutation that makes an abnormal protein that is exquisitely sensitive...",

        "The second issue that you raised has to do with the immune system, and for many years, there was a lack of enthusiasm for cancer immunology.",
        "That has changed dramatically for two reasons.",
        "One is that we have antibodies that are currently used - obviously, a tool of the immune system - that have been shown to work very effectively.",
        "We're all familiar with a drug called Herceptin, an antibody that's been around for a long time now that can help control breast cancer and reduce the incidence of metastasis and help to control the growth of metastasis.",
        "But even more exciting, in many ways, is the demonstration just over the last year and the FDA approval of a very different kind of immunological approach, an antibody that confronts or reduces a system - our immune apparatus has for damping down its own activities.",
        "So this antibody increases immunological activity by interfering with a naturally occurring suppression mechanism.",
        "And that drug, which is now known commercially as ipilimumab is - has been shown to be effective particularly in metastatic melanoma where approximately 20 or 30 percent of patients will have sustained remissions.",
        "Right.",
        "Much speculation.",
        "I'm skeptical about most of it.",
        "Yeah, because it's very hard to test for something like that, isn't it?"
