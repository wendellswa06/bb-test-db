        "Is there something - and I'm sure there is and I'm not sure what the answer of what I'm even asking you - but is there some aspect of cancer, some core aspect that we don't know yet that would help us understand how to combat the hundred or so different kinds of cancer.",

        "Right.",
        "...actually attributable to changes in the sequence of bases or rearrangements of chromosomes or changes in the proteins that coat the chromosome and determine gene activity, those are fundamental to making a cancer cell.",
        "But the cancer cell lives in an environment where there are blood vessels, immune cells and other - a lot of secreted proteins and hormones and knowing more about the relationship of a cancer to its environment is an aspect of cancer reflected in our new interest in immunotherapy but also in the use of some new therapies, like Avastin, that interfere with the development of an adequate blood supply.",
        "Right, right.",
        "There was some thought - it was thought years ago and I guess it was followed up on it if you just starve the cancer cell, take away its blood supply, it's going to go away.",

        "The sexual assault charges carry anywhere from 15 to 35 years.",

        "Does it make a difference that the suspects have extensive prior criminal records?",
        "Well, the criminal records are something we're obviously going to consider.",
        "However at this point, I would add, at least most of the defendants have very minor criminal records or petty crime criminal records.",
        "The only defendant in the case that has a significant criminal conviction is I believe Frankie Brewster that was convicted of a voluntary manslaughter back in the mid-90s and spent some time in West Virginia Penitentiary as a result of that."
