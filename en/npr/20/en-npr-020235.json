        "In the same day, today, you sell a futures contract, a promise to deliver that oil in six months for $76.",
        "All you have to do is hold onto the oil for those six months and you have made a guaranteed, locked-in profit of $5, which is an annual return of 14 percent with virtually no risk.",
        "That beats just about every other investment - stocks, bonds, treasury bills."
