        "You know, one of the things I feel is that adults are afraid to share what happened to them.",
        "It sort of comes across as a weakness.",
        "And, you know, one of the things I wanted to do, not only to release my stories from myself, but also let other adults and even children know that they're not alone in what happened to them and that, you know, ultimately try to discuss the fact that there are long-term effects from the bullying.",
        "Alan Eisenberg was interviewed for the Boston Globe series on effects of bullying over time.",

        "Thank you, Tony.",
        "As we said in the introduction, you and your colleagues reviewed more than 100 adults who were childhood bully victims.",
        "Is Alan's story common among them?",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "In fact, the reason we did this story was really because of a revelation that we had after we published the first story in our series on bullying about the experience of a 14-year-old girl.",
        "And after that story, we were flooded with emails, from adults, from people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, even in their 60s, who were still suffering in a variety of ways.",
        "And, quite frankly, I was stunned by this.",

        "In your research, was there anything, a string, a connection that tied all of these people together, beyond the fact that they were all bullied, in terms of either their personalities or their circumstances?",
        "Or did you find that people who were victims of bullying came from all spectrums of the community?",
        "I think that was a very interesting part of this for me, was to see that these people were bullied for many, many different reasons.",
        "Some of them were very big for their age.",
        "Some of them were very small.",
        "Some of them were quiet and shy and introverted, and others were quite outgoing.",

        "Thank you.",
        "I was I'm from northeast Philadelphia, and I'm a redhead, and I was bullied every single day throughout middle school and high school.",
        "And actually recently, one of the worst bullies, a male, he contacted me on Facebook and sent me a whole thread of, I'd say, like eight emails bullying me, telling me I looked really great, thank you for all the plastic surgery, which I never had, and continued the bullying.",
        "Are you saying wait a minute, did somebody continue the bullying after all these years, via Facebook with you?",
        "I'm 26, and this happened three weeks ago."

        "And I've also heard much happier stories of bullies who have contacted victims in adulthood to apologize.",
        "I think actually, your previous guest Alan Eisenberg had an experience like that.",
        "But this is something that is speaks to the very problematic nature of the new technology, which can allow these kinds of contacts to go on.",
        "I'm going to take another call, and I want to preface it by saying also, Jenna, that in the articles that you have written, the series that you have done, and they were quite interesting, and the stories were very compelling, that again, nowhere did we see that it ended in something tragic as death.",

        "She was bullied also.",
        "She has an herbal formula that cures cancer.",

        "And I'm organizing this march on Washington, August 11th, 12th and 13th, an annual event to stop the bullying.",
