        "But (unintelligible) the longitudinal studies, especially coming out from Finland that have followed children from age eight into adulthood, and they have significant psychiatric problems found even their adulthood life, including suicidal attempts that are linked to what has happened early in life.",
        "The problem with this correlation is that bullying is, as was said before, it's very prevalent across all different social settings and among all along the life span.",
        "So it's difficult to say if what happens in adulthood is absolutely linked to what happened in childhood and adolescence and/or ongoing situations that may be happening in adulthood at the workplace, for instance, in the home, and in other social settings.",
        "Were you able to hear the caller we had a few moments ago who said that she had gotten another bullying message from via Facebook?",
        "Yes, hi.",

        "What do you say to her?",
        "Yeah, the advice would be the following: Number one, not to fight back, immediately to turn to an adult, the parents in this case, and through the parents to the principal and the school counselor.",
        "Hopefully the person that is reporting this is in a state that has already enacted anti-bullying prevention public policies.",
        "And the school should protect the victim while not chastising the perpetrator.",
        "The perpetrator or perpetrators should be advised and counseled about the seriousness of their actions.",
        "And if that doesn't stop, eventually the perpetrators' parents should be advised to consult with health professionals so they can be helped to stop this serious form of mistreatment.",
        "I would imagine, Doctor, that there is a great deal of anger that is eventually built up on the part of those people who have been bullied.",
        "And to that end, I'd like to take this question and get your response to it."

        "And then you have the situation of people that, as I said before, are both victims and perpetrators, and they suffer the most.",
        "Basically what happens, it sensitizes the brain in such a way that causes post-traumatic stress disorder.",
        "And all the irritability and the depression and the sleeping difficulties and the headaches and the stomach aches are part of the post-traumatic stress disorder.",
        "And eventually the person may be exposed to very minor things that may not qualify the definition of bullying but in the eye of the beholder that's sensed as bullying.",
        "And the person re-experiences all the situations that have been done before.",
        "And the body is constantly on the alert for something else that may be happening."

        "So it was like a hierarchy of bullying.",

        "Doctor, I know that you can't stay with us very much longer, but would you like to respond to that?",
        "Yes, it happens in different modalities.",
        "First of all, we need to keep in mind that people that are not directly bullied, but they witness their friends being bullied, may also suffer from the same type of morbidity and potential mortality for several reasons one, because it may reawaken previous experiences that they may have had and/or because they may make them anxious and they are wondering when the next shoe is going to drop, and they may be bullied themselves.",

        "And my story on Sunday featured one young man, who his most vivid memory of the bullying is a day that he was being beaten up on the floor of the gym at his high school, and he looked up in the midst of being punched and hit and he saw the gym teacher watching what was happening, just shaking his head with a disgusted look as if to say, oh, why can't you stick up for yourself?",
