        "Greg, thank you very much for that.",
        "Let me say we're talking about the long-term effects of bullying on the victims.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Jenna Russell, you followed these people and their stories.",
        "Did you find that people who were bullied as children were continued or continue to be bullied as they went into the workplace and adulthood?",
        "You know, I found an interesting mix of responses.",
        "I definitely talked to people who felt that they continue to let themselves be the victim.",
        "I spoke with one man who just told me he had never been able to learn how to stick up for himself, that he was constantly letting people roll right over him.",
        "And his friends would say, why do you let people do this to you?",
        "And he didn't know how to answer.",
        "It was like a skill he had never been able to learn.",
        "But I also spoke to people who had almost the reverse reaction, a man who said his years of bullying instilled in him this just flash rage that would suddenly appear at the slightest provocation.",
        "If he felt like someone was insulting him or disrespecting him, he could barely contain himself from lashing out and hitting them.",
        "And so I think it manifest itself in a variety of ways.",
        "But I have certainly heard a lot lately about workplace bullying.",
        "Here's an email that I'd like to read to you as we bring this very interesting and in points troubling conversation to a close: Thank you for doing this story.",
        "My hand is shaking writing this email.",
        "It comes from Ken in Oakland, California.",
        "It amazes me that some people still strike a get-over-it attitude in regard to bullying.",
        "I'm a 38-year-old gay man who was bullied relentlessly throughout my childhood, verbally and physically, in both school and community settings.",
        "It has taken me years working with therapists to be able to revisit those memories, much less understand links from those experiences to my choices and behaviors as an adult.",
        "I am now better able to understand why I have been such an angry person and how I have taken that anger out on myself in unhealthy and destructive ways, and a little more about why I shut down when faced with emotionally tough situations.",
        "For years I was stumped as to why, when I tried to make healthier choices, I found I just didn't care enough about myself to do so.",
        "For years I had literally shut out many memories before the age of 16.",
        "We have run out of time, Jenna Russell, to talk about this any further.",
        "Will you be doing more?",
        "We will.",
        "We'll have more stories coming out in our series before the end of the year."

        "Well, it comes from a good writer, an old Hemingway legend.",

        "And he wrote...",

        "And every morning, every day, every live reading we go to, it's completely different.",
        "Well, what stands out to me reading the book is how many are similar, actually.",
        "And I don't know whether that's just the universality of human experience, but there's a lot about, you know, life and death.",
        "And it's the ones that stand out as individual that really crack me up, like Dave Barry who says: Journalism?",

        "One thing that really came through in all these memoirs and is part of how we liked the title, \"\"It All Changed in an Instant\"\" so much is that people were constantly talking about moments of change, moments of contrast.",
        "I used to be one-way, but now I'm another.",
        "So I think that that idea is really salient for a lot of people regardless if it's about your career, your family or something entirely different."
