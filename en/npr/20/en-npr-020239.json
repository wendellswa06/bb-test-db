        "What stands out to you in what we've seen so far, or know about so far, from these interviews and the text messages released?",
        "It all adds up to evidence - remarkably visible evidence - that the president ran a pressure campaign to get the Ukraine government to investigate Joe Biden to make Biden look corrupt.",
        "Now, there is now evidence that this pressure involved the military aid that had been approved by both parties in Congress.",
        "This is aid the Ukrainians were counting on to continue resisting Russian encroachment on their territory.",
        "And this new evidence is coming from inside Trump's own State Department, bolstering the allegations at the heart of the impeachment inquiry - the charge that he used the powers of the presidency to pressure a foreign government to aid his re-election campaign in violation and defiance of the law.",
        "The president also called on China to look into the Bidens.",
        "That's not from a text.",

        "Yes, refreshing in a way, rather breathtaking and appalling as well.",
        "The president was saying, in effect, if you have a problem with me leaning on a foreign leader this way in private, watch while I do it in the full light of day.",
        "It reminded some of us of that famous comment a few years ago about - well, that Trump made about shooting someone on Fifth Avenue and not losing his hardcore supporters.",
        "Well, then what do you make of the Republican defense of the president so far, including this one from someone who once ran against him - and it was bitter between them for a while - the senator from Florida, Marco Rubio, who was asked about the propriety of the president's request to China?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)",
        "I don't know if that's a real request or him just needling the press, knowing that you guys were going to get outraged by it.",
        "He's gotten - he's pretty good at getting everybody fired up, and he's been doing that for a while.",
        "And the media responded right on task.",
        "So Senator Rubio's essentially saying (laughter) you can't believe what the president says, but what kind of idiots are you?",
        "You know, he might have added that Trump is also good at coming up with fresh provocations as distractions - he should know that himself - new outrages if you will, at least things that are outrageous to some.",
        "One example is the announcement that immigrants - this is just from last night...",

        "And with that choice came the burden of what democracy is, making a choice that puts the responsibility of the future of your country on your own shoulders.",
        "And the weight of that responsibility really felt among Egyptians as they made this really difficult choice for president and now are bearing the consequences of the choices that president makes.",
        "Then in August, Leila, there was the news of the death of 16 Egyptian soldiers in Sinai by mass gunmen.",
        "And following that, President Morsi stepped up security, saying he was fighting back against Islamic militants.",
        "You went to Sinai, you looked for this stepped up security.",

        "Following this military campaign, he made actually quite a big decision, a military shake-up where he took back the power from the military rulers.",
        "Was there a sense that President Morsi exploited the situation?",
        "Yeah.",
        "A lot of the terrorists think that Mohammed Morsi really made a shrewd political choice.",
        "He realized there was unhappiness in the rank and file of the military with the leadership, especially with this major military breech and used that to oust his top two, if you will, enemies within the leadership and elevate those that really were more on his side."

        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "For the first time, we're seeing in music and art a documentation of a turbulent transition, an outspokenness in the lyrics of musicians.",

        "One of the things that has happened over the past year is that Egyptians have gone from that elation of 2012 where everything seemed possible - Mubarak was gone, they ousted him through a peaceful revolution - to the realization that the economy is in dire straits right now where you cannot get dollars at banks because everybody's buying them out, worried about their currency where an organization that was long oppressed under Mubarak is now being tested politically, and, according to their critics, failing and losing some popularity because they're not solving Egypt's problems overnight.",
