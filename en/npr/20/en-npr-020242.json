        "Huh.",
        "You know, we work with a lot of nonprofit (unintelligible) we're doing a project with the American Cancer Society and, you know, you can take whats your thing, whether its a battered women shelter or, you know, working with Native Americans, and six words is a form of self-expression.",

        "It can't be an easy speech to write or deliver.",

        "Hi, Joe.",
        "So, I mean - yeah.",
        "I guess the question is, are there any surprises, and if you know what they are, they won't be surprises.",
        "But is this going to be completely predictable or are we going to hear something we haven't heard before?",
        "I don't think it's going to be predictable in every nuance, not by any means.",
        "I think in some senses we could predict certain elements that we will hear in the speech.",
        "Among other things, we will hear applause, there will be tons of applause, all speeches of this nature, whether you call it the State of the Union or in this case an address to a joint session of Congress are interrupted by applause, almost after every sentence, and certainly within every paragraph.",
        "And that will come primarily from the Democratic side of the aisle, but the Democratic side of the aisle has gotten bigger.",
        "It's now 59 percent of the House and almost the same percentage in the Senate.",
        "So, there are going to be a lot of Democrats there, and they are going to be interrupting with applause a lot.",
        "Now, what is he actually going to say to get that applause?",
        "Not that it would be all that tough to coax them.",
        "But he is going to talk about increasing the confidence of the American people in themselves, in their own economic assets and in their own ability to expand those assets.",
        "And he's going to talk restoring confidence in the markets and bringing the economy back where everybody wants it to be, with full employment.",
        "He'll get a lot of applause for everything he says in that vein.",
        "I have a suggestion, that confidence-builder thing.",
        "Maybe he could say something about we have nothing to fear but - something.",
        "Yeah, Something like that.",
        "Because of what they've seen happen to their retirement savings, because of what they've seen happen to their housing values.",
        "And in many cases, all too many cases, what's happened to their jobs.",
        "Their jobs have literally disappeared and their prospects as well.",
        "So there is a endemic feeling throughout the country that things have gone badly wrong in the economy and we haven't seen anything quite like it, or so it seems, and the historians are agreeing, since the Great Depression when Franklin Roosevelt said that famous line about fear itself.",
        "Right.",
        "I think right now we have to agree people are more afraid of what is in the future than they are stunned at what's happened up to now.",
        "Right.",
        "But I'm serious about that question, and I know it's an economic question even more than a political question, but are we in a situation where if Barack Obama can make people more comfortable and more confident, that alone will do a lot to solving some of the economic problems?",
        "It could.",
        "In fact, it could do it rather quickly.",
        "If you could just arrest this down spiral where the entire country seems to be circling the drain, if you can convince people that that's not happening and that two years from now, one year from now, six months now, people will have a sense of things turning back upward, just that it's not all going to go away - then, you might see some more rational behavior."

        "But they are not going out and spending money the way they normally would and that means other people's businesses are going down and other people are losing their jobs.",

        "Having said that, government investment itself will not do the trick.",
        "We have to involve the American people much as post World War II, when we so-called rallied to arms to bring our economy back on track.",
        "And I think the same holds true today, but the focus is a little different.",
        "It's based on energy.",
        "And we have to put more resource in developing a smarter transportation system, both mass and individual transit.",
        "But also a more cohesive power structure that involves not only renewable energies but nuclear fuels and as well our traditional coals.",
        "Interesting, you mentioned nuclear there, Robert.",
        "As I understand it that disappeared from one of the language in the stimulus bill, so maybe President Obama isn't heading in the nuclear direction.",
        "My sense is that the nuclear direction is not seen as being as immediately and rich a source of job creation.",
        "But there may be other things at work in that decision as well.",
        "The president is probably still somewhat ambivalent about his relationship with some of the environmental movement elements that are intransigently opposed to nuclear power as a bigger part of the American energy mix.",
        "Now, Barack Obama is not one of those people, but he is supported by a lot of those people and he's still working out his political relationships with a lot of that movement.",
        "All right, let's now go to Mark(ph) in Salt Lake City - or I suppose it's Salt Lake City, Utah.",
