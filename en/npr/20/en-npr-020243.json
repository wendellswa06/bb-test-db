        "The American people have lost confidence in two major institutions - corporate America, in other words, Wall Street, and Congress.",
        "And one of the reasons why we haven't been able to do anything about this is corporate America buys off Congress, to either not regulate them or let them do what they want to.",
        "If Obama provided the leadership to get Congress to completely stop taking corporate America - corporate donations from PACs and all special-interest money, and limit their campaign financing to $100,000 it would restore America's confidence in our leaders so we would believe they weren't being paid off by corporations and that they were actually representing us and actually regulating corporate America.",
        "OK, interesting suggestion, Mark.",
        "Likely, Ron?",
        "There are a lot of good ideas there and a lot of fine ideals, and I do think that at times in his career, Barack Obama has sounded a little bit like this caller in pointing out the connection between policy, regulation and the rest of it and campaign finance contributions.",
        "Many of the attempts that have been made to limit spending in politics and to cut the, if you will, cord between corporate America and politics have run up against the problem of the First Amendment.",
        "People have interpreted it in the court system, particularly the Supreme Court in a famous decision back in the 1970s, they've interpreted money as speech and any restriction on the ability of individuals or corporations and so forth to get involved has had to pass a free speech test.",
        "So this has been a real struggle, and asking people to do it voluntarily, as I think I might have heard the caller say, is great and we would love to be able to say that anybody didn't volunteer to limit corporate contributions or didn't, you know, clean up his act in terms of campaign finance would be defeated.",
        "But we haven't seen that an experience yet over the last 30 years.",
        "Do you think that Supreme Court decision was the genesis of the expression \"\"money talks?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, I remember even before that, but, that decision Bob Dylan said money doesn't talk, it swears.",

        "Hi, there.",
        "I wanted to say that what I think a lot of Americans are looking for in tonight's speech, and I'm speaking particularly for myself, is that we've heard really detailed plans and I think we understand that there's going to be a process of getting out of this, and we want to hear about ways that we can involved in helping.",
        "I think a big part is getting Americans involved in the process.",
        "Involve everyday Americans, involved in trying to help stimulate this economy, help out.",
        "And in these plans hear about we're going to able to be a part of that.",
        "You know, how can we contribute, how can we do our efforts?",
        "And he's talked a lot about people being responsible and taking action.",
        "You know, I hope tonight we get a real detailed way of what we can do, different things we can contribute, ways we can help out others and really try to get through this as a country.",
        "OK, that's interesting, Justin.",
        "What about that, Ron, this notion of, you know, Barack Obama, I think in the campaign spoke of sacrifices.",
        "And we haven't heard that much about what he's asking the American people to do.",
        "I mean, famously in the Bush administration the idea was - we're asking you to go out and spend money, because that's good.",
        "And we - and that is good in a sense.",
        "But what is the president asking the American people to do, besides believe in him?",
        "I think he's asking to believe in themselves and believe in the system, in the idea that if you have confidence enough to keep your money in the bank or to spend your money as you normally would do - don't panic, don't run down to your final institution in, you know, some kind of fear that the money is not going to be there.",
        "Don't worry about whether or not you're going to have a job in five years or three years or two years unless you have some specific reason to do so.",
        "If everyone is in a lockdown panic, and no one has the confidence to act in a normal economic manner, then the normal economy can't function.",
        "So I think we might hear some tonight that might echo a little bit of that 2001 admonition from George Bush - go out and shop, go out and do what you would normally do.",
        "Take those trips, don't be afraid to fly on airplanes, get out there and live your life.",
        "We're Americans, we don't want to let the terrorists win.",
        "And in this case the president might be saying we don't want to let this bad psychology drag us down, and this bad downturn in our economy be the end of our story.",
        "OK.",
        "Let's hear what Robert in Cincinnati would like to hear the president say.",
        "I know he won't say it, but I'm wondering whether he or anyone else would speak up for the concerns about carbon emissions and say that maybe the downturn in the economy - I don't want to sound too insensitive - is good for the environment.",
        "Has anyone said that?",
        "Is it possible the president could say that?",
        "Or along the same lines, maybe this is the end of the consumerism.",
        "Maybe we ought to refigure what our priorities are in this world and that a growing economy is not the ultimate good.",
        "Right, interesting point, but - well, thank you for that, Robert.",
        "It is this restructuring notion that would have to happen, because if we do change course and stop emitting because our economy is failing, that's ultimately not a sustainable way of living in the society that we're in.",
        "It's certainly not a way of sustaining the kind of prosperity that most Americans are accustomed to.",
        "Now, there have been, over the years, back-to-the-land movements.",
        "We had the Schumacher movement, small is beautiful, and so on.",
        "And these were popular ideas within a certain generation and within a certain sensibility of Americans.",
        "I would say that is a very fine sensibility and one that has a lot to teach us about how we survive in the long run.",
        "In the very short run, people kind of had shown that they prefer their prosperity.",
        "And while we're still balancing this idea between energy and environment, the green of that movement with the green of money, this is an opportunity - the caller is quite right - to ask people to examine in their own lives what about a somewhat more constrained view of prosperity might be a good thing."
