        "So passionate is the principal about saving girls from early marriage that, two years ago, she repaid a bride price of $70 for one of her students who had been married off.",
        "She snatched the teenager away from the indignant husband and brought her back to school.",

        "When a government intrudes and imposes price controls, the natural response is for any business to find a way to replace that lost income and that's what we're seeing with the Durbin Amendment."

        "It's doubtful the new Consumer Protection Bureau has the authority to actually stop B of A or any other bank from charging the new fee, but Mr. Obama argued the banks should reconsider.",
        "If you say to the banks, you don't have some inherent right just to, you know, get a certain amount of profit if your customers are being mistreated, that you have to treat them fairly and transparently, and my hope is that you're going to see a bunch of the banks who say to themselves, you know what, this is actually not good business practice.",
        "Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, whose amendment limited the old invisible fees, was more blunt in his advice for customers who want to avoid any additional charges.",

        "But from the beginning, Barack Obama vowed to do two things in this campaign, to expand the electorate, to get a lot of people to vote who never did before, and expand the map to put Republicans on the defensive by making them fight for the states that they've come to take for granted.",
        "And he did both, and he did both amazingly, successfully.",
        "I mean, he - I mean, I was to say, he only got 52 percent of the vote, not a popular vote landslide, but electoral counts landslide, 349 electoral votes as we speak, not including North Carolina, which he may ultimately pull out and win.",
        "But the fact is, is that with all that money, with all those - the registration of new voters, with the excitement of electorate, with lines around the block, he picked up states that haven't voted Democratic in decades: Virginia not since 1964, Indiana since 1964, Missouri is still too close to call which is pretty remarkable, Florida, another state.",
        "It was early on the evening, once Barack Obama won Pennsylvania, that was really the blue state that John McCain really hoped to get, and once he took Ohio, then people said, well, it's just a matter of time and it became a matter of time because it started counting (unintelligible).",

        "I'm not really getting a real grade - it wasn't until this morning when I had like two or three hours of sleep and suddenly it just - it came to me the enormity of what happened, the c-change of what happened yesterday.",
        "It's not just states that have gone from red to blue, but it's just people's opinions, their attitudes, it just seemed to change in a blink of an eye.",
        "Yet, there were an awful lot of people who voted for the Republican candidate and not for that kind of change, obviously he was campaigning for changes.",

        "That's right.",
        "And of course, Rahm Emanuel reports say that he has been named or has been offered the position as chief of staff to Barack Obama, which is interesting because Emanuel was never a big Obama supporter.",

        "There's still 40,000 absentee votes left to be counted.",
