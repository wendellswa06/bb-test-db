        "A lot of people wondered how big was the black turnout going to be, how big was the youth turnout going to be.",
        "Well, the black turnout went from - it was 11 percent of the electorate four years ago.",
        "This time, it was 13 percent.",
        "That's about a 20 percent boost.",
        "That's very substantial.",
        "19 percent of African-Americans were first-time voters, only eight percent of whites were first-time voters.",
        "Much - there's a lot going on with African-Americans and they voted heavily - much more heavily for Obama than they did for Kerry.",
        "The youth vote is a bit of a puzzle.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "We find about the same percentage of young voters.",
        "I think it was 17 percent this time as four years ago.",
        "But of course, there was increased youth turnout because we had historically high levels of turnout, but they were across the board.",
        "We really can't come to the conclusion unless there's a problem with this exit poll that young people turned out - the turnout was disproportionately higher than elsewhere or the rate of change was disproportionately greater.",
        "And that is somewhat of a surprise.",
        "Given all the interest that we saw, particularly in the primaries."

        "In this election, 32 percent of the voters, according to the exit polls thought of themselves as Republicans dropped of five, 40 percent Democrats.",
        "A big advantage for the Democrats in part because this generation, this age cohort of young people, 18 to 30, maybe a little bit more, they're very Democratic.",
        "And a lot of Republicans worry that they have lost a generation and the other also worry about Latinos, the other big ethnic group in this country, bigger ethnic group than African-Americans.",
        "Well, they certainly lost the Latinos.",
        "We saw them lose them in 2006 and Latinos voted more Democratic, 15 percentage points more Democratic this time relative to four years ago.",
        "And the Latino vote and the African-American vote was so heavily Barack - supportive of Barack Obama.",

        "Biden is one of - you know, he obviously was up on the - he was reelected to his seventh term yesterday and obviously, he will step down.",
        "That's what happened to Lyndon Johnson in 1960 - elected vice president and senator at the same time, stepping down from the Senate seat.",
        "And it was thought that Joe Biden's son might be there to replace him.",
        "Right.",
        "Bo Biden who was the state attorney general, but he's with the Army National Guard in Iraq.",
        "He doesn't come back until next October and there's a possibility that either Minner will name a caretaker person or perhaps even somebody else like the lieutenant governor - the outgoing lieutenant governor, who would like to have the seat and of course, would not want to give it up.",
        "He would not want to be a caretaker.",
        "He'd like to hold it on beyond 2010 when Bo Biden hopefully returns from Iraq.",

        "Forget the circular firing squad among Republicans.",
        "Now is the time for pollsters and analysts to take a look and figure out who got the statistics game right.",
        "After thousands of surveys, dozens of methodological arguments and a pile of actually, you know, votes to look at, one thing seems clear, most of the pollsters have the election mostly right.",
        "That doesn't mean that some of the principal controversies in polling sampling of cell phone users, for example, have been sorted out.",
        "That, from Seth Coulter(ph).",
        "Well, that's correct.",
        "I mean, the polls did a reasonably good job.",
        "This time, they did the same good job they did four years ago and eight years with close elections.",
        "The national polls have a good track record and pretty good methodology for dealing with presidential elections.",
        "Primaries are another thing.",
        "But certainly, presidential elections turnout and many of the factors that we struggle with in this question - in this contest or race, the record speaks for itself.",

        "I'm kind of wondering if maybe what we're seeing here is a trend towards what's been called a post partisan sort of situation where some of the old categories and clichés really don't hold up.",
        "Specifically, what I mean is I was pretty surprised about the McCain campaign, the reliance on some fairly predictable sort of old clichés about how his opponent was a socialist and he was going to raise your taxes and he was weak on defense and you know, his patriotism was questionable and his religion was questionable and all these things - and I don't think the country has become unpatriotic or decided, you know, they want to be socialistic or anything.",
        "But I'm wondering if now, we're entering an era where the analysis is a little bit more nuance and the discussion is a little bit - there's little bit more information entering into the discussion.",

        "He carried by a 52 to 47 percent margin the $100,000 a year vote category.",
        "And I think one of my colleagues told me that the $200,000 a year category, which is very small, he also carried that and he talked about raising taxes among people with $200,000 a year.",

        "That, plus the war in Iraq, I suspect, that drowned out the other issues that might have played in a different kind of election's atmosphere.",
        "And to be fair, given the money disadvantage or the money advantage, depending on how you look at it, Republicans were stuck running pretty much negative advertising for the most part while the Democrats could afford to run some negative ads and a lot of positive ads as well so that they would appeal to voters on both sides."
