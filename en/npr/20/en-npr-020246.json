        "Yeah, hi.",
        "Thanks for accepting my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "You know, one thing which is interesting to me - and I hope that not only the Republican Party but everybody who learns - is that Barack Obama and his ability to use media technology and media fundraising is the way of the future and the McCain campaign certainly fell very short and I think lost the vote on that.",
        "But my major issue is - or major concern was that as a white male - you know, I was very concerned when I heard that people were picking at the issue of the Bradley affect because white voters wouldn't vote for Barack Obama strictly because of his race and I was hoping that we could be above the race card in this day and age.",
        "And I think, in some respects, the opposite thing occurred because looking at demographics this morning, I saw - I think the statistics was 96 percent of African-Americans voted for Barack Obama.",
        "Well, certainly, he had a great appeal and in fact with the number of people who came out for this election, my feeling was that whoever won, it was truly the nation's decision because so many people came out to vote.",
        "But I was concerned to see such a high percentage of African-American voters voting for Barack Obama.",
        "It seems that the race card, in some respects, came out.",
        "Well, they voted from strictly based on race and not solely on issues.",
        "Andy, what is the normal percentage of African-Americans who would vote for a Democratic candidate regardless of his race?",
        "About 90 percent.",
        "I mean, I think that more African-Americans did vote for Barack Obama unquestionably and more registered to vote and more voted than in previous elections, a record number, and it's not too surprising.",
        "This is a historic election.",
        "The first black candidate - major black candidate, African-American, people tend to vote along their personal lines especially groups that haven't experienced power.",
        "But what we can draw from this is, is that while we, analysts worry that race would be a negative factor in this campaign, actually, it was a positive because of the boost that Obama got, not only from African-Americans but from many whites who were interested - thought it was very important that an African-American candidate be elected.",
        "I'm not saying they vote - they were voting for him purely along those lines, but that offsets that small - relatively small percentage of whites who said race was a factor and they went overwhelmingly for McCain.",
        "So I think in the end, race mattered and it was probably more of a plus for Obama than a negative."

        "Perhaps it's the Sarah Palin effect.",
        "Perhaps it's the fact that in reality, no Democrat has been elected senator in Alaska since 1974, and Ted Stevens said, look, you know, I wasn't really convicted or I was convicted by a corrupt jury or unfair jury and I think they bought it, which is very interesting.",

        "President-Elect BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois): This is our time to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids, to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace, to reclaim the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope; and where we are met with cynicism and doubts and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people.",

        "To a certain extent, you could argue that John McCain may have lost some of the confidence of the American public.",
        "But certainly, Obama built it."

        "And finally, Martin Luther King's, I Have a Dream speech, a big part of that was - of that dream was that the day would come when his children would be judged not by the color of their skin but the content of their character, and this day is historical, I would humbly submit in that I think that day has come.",
