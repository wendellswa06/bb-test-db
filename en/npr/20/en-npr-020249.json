        "They - they're up to a couple of miles high, they're very unusual, they go all the way across the planet.",
        "And we've not seen anything quite like this on the Earth, on the moon, on Mars, or even Venus.",
        "And what we're looking at here is something that's very ancient that represents the crushing together of the crust.",
        "And it may be in fact, that this is the kind of thing that represents how plate tectonics started on the Earth.",

        "So looking at these ancient, huge scarp features may provide real clues as to how the pushing together of the crustal material can ultimately result in the kind of tectonic regime we see today, which is something we just don't know the origin of on the Earth.",
        "Do we think that Mercury may have formed like our moon did from breaking off some other part of some planet, some rocky surface, or did it just aggregate space debris leftover from the formation of the Solar System?",
        "Well, there's a lot of debate about that.",
        "And that's one of the key things that we're going to be able to try to address here.",
        "One of the ideas is that it might be more like the Earth in the sense that, to explain its very high density, one possibility is that something hit it and then the ejector from that essentially ended up going into the sun because the sun is so close by.",
        "So maybe a similar kind of event to the impact process that hit the Earth and then ejected material to form the moon may have occurred on Mercury making it so dense.",
        "So, the idea is maybe similar kinds of things are going on there, and that's one of the jobs of the Messenger mission is, to try to look at the geology, this internal structure, and to decide, and as we go into orbit later on, as to which of those possibilities is correct.",
