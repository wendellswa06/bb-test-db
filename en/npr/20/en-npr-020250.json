        "You know, we're hundreds of millions of miles away.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And you can actually go to the counter on the Web site and you can just see them clicking off like crazy.",
        "And of course, by the time we get to Mercury ultimately, we have two more flybys, in October of this year and September of 2009.",
        "And then, we undergo what they call orbit insertion into orbit in March 2011 for at least a year of detail investigation of the surface.",
        "So, you know, as far as frequent flyer miles go, I wish I had a credit card that counted these.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's what I meant.",
        "Eventually, you get to go way out into the Solar System and then back again.",
        "And you flew by Venus once already, correct?",
        "That's correct.",
        "Actually, we've been by Venus twice.",
        "We went by Earth first.",
        "We went out and then back by Earth.",
        "And all the things are designed to not use fuel, to do sort of gravity assist, they're called, to reorient the spacecraft to speed it up or slow it down so that ultimately, it can go into orbit around Mercury.",
        "And one of the exciting things we had happen, of course, was that we had a great successful encounter on Monday, a flyby, we got all the data, we could see from the sensors that it was all on the spacecraft ready to be played back.",
        "And then, all of a sudden, a spacecraft that was studying the sun declared an emergency, which meant that it had priority for all the antennas that bring the data back, and we had to sit there and sweat bullets while we're waiting for that emergency to be cleared up so the data we knew had been obtained could actually come back down to Earth and so that we could see it.",
        "So, that happened pretty quickly.",
        "But again, the engineers that work for NASA and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, you know, we have great confidence in them.",
        "And sure enough, they all came through.",
        "And we have all the data, over a thousand pictures.",
        "That's great.",
        "They also serve those who stand and wait.",
        "Exactly."

        "James, I'm so proud of you guys.",
        "Man, this is an outrageous accomplishment.",
        "And again, to further what you said, kudos to the engineers involved there.",
        "The calculations on this were so intricate.",
        "And to come within two kilometers is just an amazing feat.",
        "Very quickly, I'd like to know something more on what we know about the temperature of Mercury, and does it not revolve as the moon does and keeps one face toward the sun?",
        "And also, there was a blurb on the pictures that I saw yesterday that said that there may be a chance of ice caps on Mercury.",
        "I found that outrageous.",
        "Is that accurate?",
        "It's absolutely - first of all, thank you very much for your support because it's your tax dollars at work and we're hoping…",
        "You bet.",
        "I'm proud of you.",
        "…we spend them well.",
        "Mercury is extremely hot because it's so close to the sun.",
        "It does not have one face completely towards the sun all the time.",
        "It has a very intricate relationship that brings all the surface into contact with the sun eventually.",
        "But the key is that the polar regions at the top and the bottom of the planet, if you will, if you have a hole, a crater there, those don't get illuminated by the sun, and that's why we see these unusual features that have been interpreted potentially to be ice.",
        "If you can imagine, a comet hitting the surface, and ice from that comet going to a cold trap, like going to the local refrigerator…"

        "So, we hope to be able to sense that when we get into orbit and test to see, in fact, whether there's ice.",
        "But theoretically, it could be there and it will be incredibly exciting to have polar deposits of ice on a planet that is so close to the sun.",
        "What are the…",
        "(Unintelligible)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Are the poles tilted so that you have it like sometimes they're in the shadows, sometimes they're in the sun?",
        "No, they are - at least for the period of time, we understand the orbit, they have been permanently shattered, if you will.",
        "So it's pretty clear that if they get tilted towards the sun and the sun gets in there, that the ice wouldn't stand a chance given how close it is to the sun.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, that's what I was asking.",
        "So, what kind of temperature extremes are we talking about right there?",
        "I imagine where the shadow just starts, you know, between the sun and the shadow, there must be an incredible temperature.",
        "Oh, there's - it's many, many hundreds of degrees and it's not the place you'd want to be standing any time of the day, believe me.",
        "It's basically hot enough to melt a lot of things like lead and other things like that in some cases.",
        "And, you know, the temperature extremes - I remember I worked in the Apollo program and the astronauts told me that when they were walking in front of the spacecraft and behind in the shadow, they could actually feel the temperature difference between their spacesuits.",
        "I hate to say what kind of things they would feel if they were walking with the Terminator(ph) on Mercury because it wouldn't be very comfortable at all.",

        "You're welcome.",

        "Sure.",
        "There's lots of things that cause craters.",
        "So, largely, like comets and, you know, things like meteorites, that are in orbit around the sun.",
        "And what we understand is that in the early days of the history of the Solar System, there was a lot of that material as the solar - as the sun was forming and the material was forming around it, so all that collected together to form essentially the planets.",
        "But there's a lot of material left over, and so the bombardment of the planets continued for quite some time.",
        "So, we know, from looking at Mercury and the moon, we couldn't tell this from the Earth, but looking at Mercury and the moon, for example, that the rate of bombardment was very high early on, you can almost think of it as the planets vacuuming up all the rest of the debris.",
        "And then there's places like the asteroid belt, where there's still a lot of debris out there.",
        "And some of that comes in and out of the inner Solar System continuing to hit the planetary surfaces.",
        "So this is where the material comes from.",
        "And we were able to actually use this information to try to date some of the surfaces on these planets.",

        "What is so important about knowing about that?",
        "Well, the magnetic field tells you a lot about the internal structure.",
        "It also tells you a lot about the way in which the planet interacts with the sun and the material essentially coming from the sun.",
        "So, for us, as geoscientists, we're really interested in whether the interior, like the core, is actually convecting or not.",
        "If it's liquid, if it's convecting, if it's moving around, circulating or whether it's frozen solid, if you will, because that tells us a lot about how the planet is losing its heat.",
        "It tells us a lot about heat gets transferred, how heat gets transferred from the interior to the surface and how all the geology should work.",
        "So, we'd look at the geology to try to interpret the interior.",
        "And measurements of the magnetic field can tell us whether things like, on the Earth, whether things are actually moving in the inside.",
        "It can also tell us a lot about, you know, how particles are interacting with the surface.",
        "If you have a strong magnetic field, for example, it affects the particles in the surrounding region from the sun.",
        "All of these things go together to really getting an understanding of the personality of the planet and its environment.",

        "Good afternoon.",
        "And I echo that first caller, a job very well done, tax dollars are well-spent.",
        "If it's true that the sun is expanding, is it possible that at one time that that actually could have had an atmosphere and then as it expanded, then - or Venus did then Earth and then maybe Mars next?",
        "Well, I'm not an expert on the evolution of the sun.",
        "I think, for the most part, the sun has been relatively stable since the formation of the planets, in that sense.",
        "But, you know, if you take a look at the long-term sort of billions of year evolution, the sun will obviously go through some phases when, in fact, the sun will expand out to the position of the planets.",
        "And if you think Mercury was hot now then you don't want to be around then either there or Venus or the Earth.",
        "But that's billions of years in the future, so don't sell any real estate yet."

        "And, you know, I remember Sputnik, I was in high school at the time.",
        "And it's just stunning to me to think about what we've learned about the Solar System.",

        "It's really our formative years and it's sort of like if you wanted to understand another person, you would want to know their childhood, what that was like, what the traumatic experiences were, what their, you know, parents were like, et cetera.",
        "And this is exactly why studying the planets is so informative about our own home planet.",

        "If you can imagine having an umbrella, you know, that would withstand the solar energy and heat, so we actually point the sunshade - actually, they point the sunshade at the sun and then they worked the spacecraft around so that we can get all our data without being cooked."
