        "So it's like a huge umbrella - it's not actually huge, it's like an umbrella that would protect you from the sun, the intense solar radiation and heat.",
        "And again, if that thing fails or we rotate the spacecraft in a manner, you know, it's basically over in a very short period of time.",
        "But again, that's just testimony to the really great engineers that are in charge of this program.",
        "Now when the - let me just remind everybody that this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow, talking about the Mercury, the Messenger Mercury mission with James Head.",
        "When you go into orbit, eventually, when the Messenger goes into orbit, will it map the whole planet?",
        "Yes, it'll essentially map the whole planet.",
        "It will re-map things that we've seen before.",
        "But that's great because we'll get to see them from a different perspective.",
        "You know, each time you look at a different lighting angle, et cetera, you discover huge new things.",
        "And so we'll be able to map the whole planet and we'll be using a whole bunch of different images - different instruments.",
        "We have an imaging system, a gamma rays spectrometer, a neutron spectrometer, X-rays, magnetometers, a laser altimeter that will get topography for us.",
        "It was very - a distinct instrument that will get surface mineralogy.",
        "And so we have a whole host of instruments that will be brought to bear on the planet to get global coverage, which will then really unravel all the rest of the secrets of Mercury.",
        "You know, I'm thinking of the orbiting around the planet.",
        "I'm thinking you going from day to night, to day to night, the temperature extremes for the spacecraft and it must be unbelievable.",
        "It is.",
        "It is.",
        "But it's high enough so that actually, you're not in the shadow very much for the most part.",
        "But again, the whole thermal balance, the temperature balance that has to be maintained is a real challenge for the engineers.",
        "And I should say that the people - I'm very pleased that there's so much excitement about this mission because there's certainly is - here and among the students at Brown University and so on.",
        "But, you know, this was something NASA started a number of years ago called the Discovery Program.",
        "And Wes Huntress started this as the associate administrator.",
        "And it's basically ask people from outside to propose missions to NASA and help lead them.",
        "And Sean Solomon, the director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, proposed a team with APL and a number of scientists.",
        "And this is an amazing low-cost mission that's getting all of this done.",
        "And it's really a great way of doing business.",
        "And Sean and the team here have just been super.",
        "But we keep hearing scientists talking about the robotic missions, such as yours, now facing possible cutbacks because of the idea of going - the man space missions might eat up so much money to go to the moon and Mars.",
        "Well, that's always a question, you know.",
        "As I mentioned, my first job was working on the Apollo program and astronaut training and site selection, mission operations and so on.",
        "And it's very clear, humans are excellent observers and they can do a significant amount on planetary exploration by just being there and really seeing things and collecting samples and so on.",
        "And certainly, if we go back to the moon and we will very soon, with humans, you know, we want to optimize their capabilities."

        "But at the same time, of course, you need to have balance.",
        "And I always look upon it as the partnership between human and robotic exploration.",
        "Obviously, humans aren't going to Mercury for quite a while.",
        "Does that mean we don't want to visit it?",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "So, we have to have a partnership and a balance between those.",
        "And I think that's - it's a constant struggle.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There are the issues--you know, broken bones from people battered about by these floodwaters, there have been some electrocutions from people coming too near downed power wires.",
        "So there are the immediate emergency issues that come up in a storm like this.",
        "But that's something that's really, really important.",
        "And again, even when humans go, they need robotic partnerships.",
        "They need to have rovers like they did on the Apollo missions.",
        "They need to have, you know, automated rovers and other spacecraft that can go out and do things that they can't, scouting and so on.",
        "So…",
        "Let me see if I can get one more audio question in from Second Life.",
        "Absolutely.",

        "What we're looking at on Mercury right now, will that tell us anything about what it will be like on the Earth this time a few billion years from now?",

        "You mean it can orbit back on its own for that many billions of years?",
        "Well, probably not.",
