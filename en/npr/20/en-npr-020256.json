        "Sergeant Stanbough started his recovery under the old Army system and remained a member of the brigade he went to war with.",
        "He says he sees a difference since being placed in the new warrior transition unit this past summer.",
        "The squad leaders are from the hospital, that worked in a hospital, that knows how to get all these paperwork or knows how to make all the appointments that they need to make and show them around the hospital and just help them navigate their way through the whole process because the squad leaders are the subject matter experts of the whole thing.",
        "The new units are also supposed to have a higher ratio of support staff per soldier, helping the wounded handle the rehabilitation and medical care.",
        "But after years of complaining about Army neglect and mistreatment, critic Andrew Pogany says some combat veterans he works with remain deeply skeptical.",
        "So some of the soldiers had voiced some concerns about that, that nothing has really changed except that they gave it a different name.",
        "They're putting a different face on it.",
        "But Pogany says it's too early to pass judgment.",
        "He says his advocacy group is keeping a close eye on how the Army follows through, and is concern about how long it's taking Fort Carson to get its Warrior Transition Unit up and running.",
        "It's already missed the Army's goal of being 50 percent staffed by now, and only has about a sixth of the soldiers it expects to eventually serve with that capacity."

        "Those leaders in the House have resisted it, viewing it as both politically unpopular and pointing out that the 2020 elections are just over a year away.",
