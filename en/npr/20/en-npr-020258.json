        "What else do they want this new helicopter to do?",
        "Well, I just talked with Loren Thompson.",
        "He's a defense analyst.",
        "He knows a lot about this program.",
        "And here's his list of what they want it to have.",
        "Many of the things that are carried on the presidential helicopter are secret.",
        "However, what we do know is that it has extensive self-protection capabilities against surface-to-air missiles; that it has hundreds of pounds of very secret communications equipment so the president can stay in touch with foreign leaders where there's nuclear forces and so on; that it has a kitchen, it has a bathroom, it has seating for 14 people, and it has a multiperson crew.",
        "Now, it also has to be small enough to land in that tight confinement of the White House grounds.",
        "And the other thing, they want it to go farther.",
        "The current helicopter goes maybe 150 miles before it has to refuel.",
        "This one, they want to go 300 miles in the event of a nuclear attack.",
        "And meantime, this helicopter - fleet of helicopters is over budget and overdue.",
        "That's right.",
        "What happened is they kept adding requirements to it.",
        "They want it to be able to prevent a missile attack, better communications and so forth.",
        "Even the seats had to be able to take nine G's in case it drops out of the sky, and it can protect people.",
        "And they've built five of these already, and the next line of 23 will have an even more equipment.",
        "And there's talk about adding a new engine to compensate for the added weight.",
        "Why do they need 28?",
        "It's not only the president who will use these but also the vice president, some of the top leaders, Defense Secretary Gates, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",
        "And also, when the president goes around the country or overseas, they'll bring the helicopter along with him.",
        "Now, when Senator John McCain says this is more expensive than Air Force One, is he right?",
        "Well, he is.",
        "In 1990, when they procured the two Air Force One planes, it was a total cost of $650 million, so roughly $325 million each.",
        "But a better comparison might be the F22 fighter, the Air Force's most sophisticated jet, and that cost roughly the same as one of these helicopters - around $400 million."

        "Well, what happens now?",
        "And Barack Obama said this is a procurement process run amock.",
        "Do they scrap it?",
        "What do they do?",
        "Well, thanks so much.",
        "Yeah, that's one of the big problems, actually, with fighting the flu is that the technology that they use predominately to develop the flu vaccine is pretty antiquated.",
        "It's based on trying to grow up the flu strains in eggs, actually, which takes a long time, which means they have to really kind of do guesswork, educated guesswork way back early in the year to try to guess what strains might be circulating the following winter.",
        "Well, how do they arrive at that, and then how do they arrive then at the strains that they put into those chicken eggs?",
        "Yeah, basically they're just trying to look at the historical record, see what kind of strains have been circulating in the previous year, what strains are circulating in other parts of the world already.",
        "And they - you know, basically based on that and based on past experience, they try to come up with formulas they think might work.",
        "And a lot of times it doesn't quite match, and many times it does.",
        "And this year it looks like they're a good match.",
        "Did they put in protection against one particular strain, or is this sort of a rainbow?",
        "Oh, usually it's two or three strains, usually two that they use as the predominate strains that they're trying to protect people against.",
        "Is there any hope that they may come up with a universal vaccine?",
        "Yeah, yeah, that's the great hope and ambition is that one day they'll be able to come up with a vaccine that would work against all strains, and there's some promising research that hopefully may someday lead to that, but they're not there yet.",
        "We don't have that quite yet."

        "Well, that's the vaccine news.",
        "There's also - is there any progress towards updating that procedure, where you don't have to grow it in eggs?",
        "Oh yes, and in fact yes, there's a lot of work going on to try to develop alternative methods of developing the flu vaccine, specifically to try to develop what they call a cell-based technique, which would involve using cells instead of chicken eggs.",
        "And the FDA in fact this year proved that for the first time in this country.",
        "All right, we've also seen activity earlier, I guess it's been about 10 years since there's been a flu season that's started this early.",
        "That's right, the last time a flu season started this early was back in the 2003-2004 season.",
        "Usually the season doesn't really get going until about a month later, like January, February.",
        "But back in 2003-2004, it started to pick up early, like this year, and that's the year that it was particularly bad.",
        "There was - a lot of people got really sick, there were more deaths than usual, especially more deaths among kids, and that's the thing that really has people worried, that they don't want to see a repeat of that.",
        "Eight states already, where is most active?",
        "Well, it seemed to start mostly in the southern states and south, southern-central states.",
        "And there were four states initially where there was widespread flu activity.",
        "In the following week, that doubled, up to the eight states that you mentioned.",
        "And those included Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina.",
        "And then they added states like New York and Alaska, Ohio, Rhode Island and South Carolina.",
        "How many people, on average, and every flu season is different, but on average how many people die from this every year?",
        "Yeah, the average - I mean, it does vary from year to year, but on average it tends to be around 36,000 Americans will die from the flu.",
        "So it's a significant public health problem."

        "So during flu season, that's over 100 a day.",
        "I guess if you average it out that way, I guess it could - yeah, and now usually most people, it's important to note, you know, they get pretty sick, but they do recover.",
        "It's really people - the people who are most vulnerable to it are older people or elderly people, young kids and people who have other health problems, and they're the ones who are most susceptible to the severe complications that can result in death.",
        "And we keep hearing about the best way to prevent the flu, of course wash your hands frequently and of course get a vaccine.",
        "Yes absolutely.",
        "The best way to protect yourself against the flu is to get the flu shot.",
        "It's highly effective, it is very safe, and that's certainly the best way to do it.",
        "And there's a big push on - especially to get health care workers to get vaccinated because they can be people who can spread the virus around.",
        "And there's some hospitals and facilities that require their employees to get flu shots, and, well, there's some pushback, some employees really, really object to that.",
        "Yeah, yeah, that's something that really picked up back in 2009, when we had the H1N1 pandemic.",
        "There were - a lot more places started requiring their doctors or nurses, the nurses' aides, the nursing home employees to get vaccinated against the flu.",
        "That didn't make a lot of people happy, but the result was that the vaccination rates have started to increase significantly.",
        "There also seem to be available, just in the past few years, every drug store seems to offer flu shots.",
        "That's relatively new.",
        "Yeah, you can get it at most drug stores.",
        "Many more employers are offering it, and that's also a really big way of getting people vaccinated, when their employers offer it for their employees.",
        "Well, joining us now is Dr. Thomas Frieden, who is the administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and - excuse me, I'm just getting the sheet of paper here - director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, with us from a studio at the CDC down there in Atlanta.",

        "And we mentioned that average of, what, about 36,000 people a year who die from the flu.",
        "Are those preventable deaths?",
        "Flu causes a lot of illness.",
        "In an average flu season, tens of millions of Americans get sick from flu.",
        "And as with many biological phenomenon, it's essentially a bell curve.",
        "So you will have people who will get a flu infection and won't even know it, even though they might be able to spread it to others.",
        "Okay.",
        "Will, a challenge for next week.",
        "On the extreme other end, people who may die from flu, particularly the elderly or people with underlying health problems.",
        "But most people will get a little bit sick or sick for up to a week.",

        "It can knock you out, miss a few days of work and feel pretty miserable.",
        "Yet again, are those preventable deaths?",
        "The vast majority of flu deaths could be prevented if we had widespread vaccination, not all of them because the vaccine isn't perfect, particularly for people who have weakened immune systems.",
        "And the best way we can protect those people is for others to get vaccinated.",
        "So we found for example that if the health care workers in nursing homes get vaccinated, then the residents of nursing homes are less likely to get severely ill in that flu season.",
        "And how critical is it, the guesswork that goes into the creation of that vaccine, and I don't mean to slight it, it's very educated guesswork?",
        "It's definitely an educated guess, but it's also a tribute to a wonderful global collaboration.",
        "Countries all around the world track the flu virus.",
        "They get specimens from sick people, they send them to standardized laboratories that we at the CDC and the World Health Organization ensure are doing quality work, and then they check what happens in different parts of the world.",
        "And you see the migration of flu across the world, and you - at a certain point in time you have to pull the trigger and make a guess of which three strains to include in this year's flu vaccine."
