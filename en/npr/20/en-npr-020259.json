        "Now interestingly we're going to be able to add a fourth strain in future years, one of the incremental improvements in flu vaccine technology.",
        "But as it happens, this year the three strains that are include match about 90 percent of the circulating strains of flu, the three most common strains.",

        "Not to sound insensitive, but it seems like a pretty disproportional response to say, you know, I'm supposed to go get an injection because 36,000 out of 300 million people are, you know, falling to this disease, to the flu and, you know, most of those being people who are already immunocompromised, like infants or elderly or related to other diseases.",
        "So to be frank, it seems more about making some money for health companies or pharmaceutical companies to generate this stuff.",
        "Is there a necessity for people who are healthy and not elderly or infants to get the shot, Doctor?",
        "Only if you want to be less likely to get the flu.",
        "The flu vaccine works.",
        "It reduces the risk that you'll get sick.",
        "A lot of people are going to get the flu in an average flu season, tens of millions of Americans so not just the people who die from it.",
        "But tens of millions of people who will be off from work, feel miserable, go through something that you really wouldn't want to go through.",
        "Remember that flu isn't the common cold.",
        "Common cold, you may feel bad for a day or two, sore throat, but the flu makes you really quite sick, with high fever, body aches, lots of feeling miserable.",
        "So even a garden-variety flue case is very unpleasant.",
        "So getting vaccinated reduces your risk.",
        "It also reduces other people's risk, and that's a reasonable thing to do, as well, especially if you've got a young child in your home that you're concerned about or an elderly person.",
        "Rob Stein, the other part of Mike's question, is this a big profit center for vaccine manufacturers?"

        "Yeah, I mean, drug companies certainly do make money from manufacturing the vaccine, but they don't - it's not a hugely profitable product for them.",
        "And in fact it's been a real problem in making sure that the United States does have the facilities to produce enough vaccine for the country.",
        "You might remember back in the pandemic year, when that was a real problem, making sure that there was enough vaccine available quickly enough.",

        "Thus far, only about 37 percent of the population has gotten the shot.",
        "That's a serious concern because the flu causes a couple of hundred thousand hospitalizations each year and tens of thousands of deaths.",

        "Hey.",
        "Good morning, Steve.",
        "Similarly, we looked at the group of pregnant women.",
        "Flu can be very serious in a pregnant woman, and with H1N1, we increased the awareness of the importance of vaccinating pregnant women and increased the number of obstetricians who provide the flu vaccine in their offices.",
        "We find that although overall about 50 percent of pregnant women have been vaccinated this season, if the obstetrician offers the flu vaccine, that nearly is nearly 75 percent.",
        "So making it easier for people is important, and that's one reason we're so encouraged that more and more pharmacies and workplaces are providing the vaccine.",
        "In fact, more than a third of everyone who was vaccinated this year was vaccinated either in a pharmacy and/or in a workplace; that is among adults.",

        "I agree with you 1,000 percent, and I would encourage you to get on the site of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, also known as the ACIP.",
        "We think it's really important that the information that we use to come to recommendations is entirely transparent.",
        "The ACIP is the non-governmental body, coordinated by the CDC, with the world's experts in the different diseases that makes recommendations for vaccination, whether it's influenza or any other vaccine that we recommend."

        "So the immune system of pregnant women is a little less effective than immune system of the same woman who is not pregnant.",
        "In addition, simply having the large uterus compresses the lungs some and makes the lungs a little bit more susceptible to severe infections.",

        "What about public service announcements?",
        "What about ads on TV?",
        "CDC funds state and local governments, and we work with broadcasters and producers and others to provide information about influenza.",

        "Yes, in fact it does seem that although you need this year's flu vaccine to protect you against this year's flu, there is some benefit to prior years' vaccinations but only if you get a similar flu strain in that year.",
        "And the flu has a tremendous variability.",
        "So you can shift or drift from one type of flu to another, and that's why you need to get the vaccine each year, but doing that may have some cumulative benefit.",
        "And another email question: What's the incubation period from the time someone's exposed, infected to the virus to the time they begin to show symptoms?",
        "And how long is an infected person contagious?",
        "You can actually be contagious with the flu from before you show symptoms, by a day or two, and you generally would stop shedding large amounts of flu when you no longer have a fever.",
        "Though you can still grow it from people from sometime thereafter, we think generally to spread it to others you've probably more likely got to be coughing and ill.",

        "It's a virus that's grown in the laboratory until it can't make people sick, but it can only be used on certain people.",
        "So it is only approved for people up to the age of 50, and it's not approved for people who have certain counter-indications such as a weakened immune system just 'cause we're not 100 percent certain that it would be safe in that environment.",
        "But it's not a shot.",
