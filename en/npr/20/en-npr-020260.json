        "She's a vegan, and she is really adamant about it.",
        "And so our question is, in trying to be preventative about this: Are there any alternatives for someone who's vegan?",
        "Because as I understand, the vaccine is derived from eggs.",
        "It's grown in eggs, yes.",
        "Doctor, is the mist also developed that way?",
        "You know, I would have to check on that.",
        "So we could check to see how the flu mist is grown.",
        "It's a live, attenuated vaccine, and I'm not certain of whether or not eggs are made - are used in the process.",
        "There are other ways to protect yourself against the flu, although the vaccine is the best tool.",
        "Washing your hands, covering your cough and ensuring that people who are sick with fever and flu stay home, can protect others.",
        "And I wonder, Rob Stein, the - that new technique you were talking about earlier that doesn't use eggs, is that coming online anytime soon?",
        "Well, it was approved by the FDA.",
        "So it is available to be used.",
        "It was approved too late, really, for this year's flu vaccine, but it would be available if, for example, another strain suddenly emerged, like a pandemic strain suddenly emerged.",
        "They would be able to sort of put that into action and try to produce extra vaccine if they needed to do that.",
        "And the benefit would be not merely that vegans could use it too, but also that it would be a little quicker than the current technique."

        "OK.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Doctor, you're about to say?",
        "We do expect that by the next flu season, if all goes well, the cell-based vaccine should be available on the market.",
        "And would it completely replace the previous egg-grown vaccine?",
        "No.",
        "Probably both will be on the market.",
        "They both have different characteristics.",
        "And there wouldn't be enough of the cell-based produced vaccine for the entire country, but it'll be another option for people, just as FluMist is another option for people now.",

        "And I also wanted to recommend to your listeners a documentary film called \"\"The Greater Good,\"\" which looks at the vaccine issue and vaccine safety, and it follows three families that are affected by vaccination.",
        "It's a fabulous film.",
        "But I'm curious about this rural-urban question, if you guys have thoughts on that."

        "Well, is there any difference, rural or urban, Doctor?",
        "There's variability.",
        "So even among urban areas and among rural areas, we may see very different levels of flu activity for reasons that we don't completely understand.",
        "One of the things that we saw in the past year in many rural areas related to 4-H clubs and work with county fairs was spread of a certain strain of swine flu or swine-origin influenza to kids and others who had close contact in county fairs with swine, what was called H3N2 variants.",
        "So we had a strain of swine flu that had picked up one of the genes from the H1N1 pandemic influenza virus, and then it had come back into people, and we've seen several hundred cases of that.",
        "As we worked with some of the agricultural groups in the Midwest to reduce the human-swine contact, we saw fewer cases.",
        "So there are different kinds of patterns of flu disease.",
        "What we do sometimes see in cities, in schools, are large outbreaks of influenza.",
        "And during the H1NI pandemic we had schools that had hundreds or even over a thousand cases of influenza spreading very rapidly.",
        "But of course you can have a crowded school even in a rural or semi-rural area.",
        "We're talking with Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
        "Rob Stein is also with us from our Science Desk.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And Rob, I wanted to follow up.",
        "A couple of years ago, during that H1N1 pandemic, we saw new ways of tracking the outbreaks of flu using Google Maps.",
        "Is this working out?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I mean that's one of the methods, new methods that have come along where they're using tools like Google to track outbreaks of various diseases, and actually they have these crawlers.",
        "The World Health Organization has a similar system now where they have these Web crawlers out there that are looking for all sorts of signs of anything that might indicate that there's a disease that is cropping up.",
        "They look for runs on certain drugs and stores and people going to the doctor for certain things more often and developing lots of new tools.",
        "It's really interesting stuff.",
        "Not just Tamiflu but other drugs...",
        "Right, exactly.",
        "Right.",
        "People going in for, you know, just regular cold medications or going to see their doctors for various things.",
        "Oh, by the way, just to answer another earlier call, the FluMist website says you should not get FluMist if you have a severe allergy to eggs, gentamicin, gelatin or arginine.",
        "And that would, I guess, suggest that it is derived from eggs.",
        "So take that information to your vegan daughter and avoid the mist, I guess, as well."

        "And so, Rob, yes, those most at risk are the very young and the very old, but that's not everybody.",
        "Is Britain any closer to actually completing this deal to leave the EU?",
        "Yeah, that's right.",

        "But I do know that - or at least I've been told that they use mercury to make the vaccines and that there is mercury in the vaccines themselves, and that there are some people in the population who have a terrible reaction to the mercury in the vaccine as well as whatever other toxic chemicals they use.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don't mean to cut you off, Peter, but I wanted to give Dr. Frieden a chance to respond.",
        "We just have a couple of minutes left.",
        "We check every possible reaction to the flu vaccine.",
        "We have not seen reactions like the one that you describe to any of the components in the flu vaccine or to the flu vaccine itself.",
        "But one of the reasons that we track things like this is to know if anything like that happens.",
        "And again, as with the information I shared earlier about the ACIP, we provide all of that information publicly on the Internet, not with people's names, of course, but with the frequency of different adverse events.",
        "And we have not seen anything like that as a trend, but it's something that we would absolutely look at.",
        "And I certainly hope that she does better."

        "It's not present in the single-use vials and it's not present in the flu mist either.",
