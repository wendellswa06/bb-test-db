        "So, first of all we keep using the phrase G8.",
        "What is the G8?",
        "The Group of Eight, which was for many years the Group of Seven, are the eight largest economies on the planet.",
        "So, the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and Russia are, for example, G8 countries.",
        "So, when people from these nations meet, and talk about an African agenda, what do they bring to the table, and what's on the table this time around?",
        "Well, I'll try not to give you a cynical answer, but basically the Group of Eight meet to discuss the world's economy, for the most part that's what they're supposed to be talking about.",
        "But over the last number of years there's been greater attention to the question of Africa, and issues of economic development.",
        "And there's been a lot of pressure on the Group of Eight, to come forward with financial assistance, changes in the relationship - economic relationships, in order to promote development.",
        "And so, once again that came to the table this time in addition to sort of a review of what the G8 has accomplished and not accomplished towards reducing poverty.",
        "Now, when we look at this, what they're doing, there was a - you know, in some ways perhaps a minor incident, but a telling one where the British publication, the Telegraph, reported online that the G8 leaders enjoyed a six course lunch followed by an eight course dinner.",
        "African leaders were not invited and of course they're talking about the global hunger situation.",
        "There was a lot of static about that.",
        "Do you think that, that was symbolic in any way or just, you know, big time world business as usual?",
        "Well, Farai now you're going to draw the cynical side out of me.",
        "This was an incredibly stupid, careless move, by the G8 leaders where they basically seemed to have thought off camera they could do whatever they wanted to.",
        "And they demonstrated, for all to see, the contempt actually that they have towards the rest of the world.",
        "That they basically - they see themselves, as in effect, the rulers of this planet.",
        "So, when they're on camera there'll be the tears, there'll be the concern.",
        "Off camera you saw this hideous example of consumption.",
        "What do you think the G8 leaders should be doing in terms of an Africa agenda?",
        "I'm going to get to a couple of specific things, specific national issues of Zimbabwe and Nigeria in a second.",
        "Sure."

        "Considering that report, it is very awkward for them to have him in the room, and ultimately what they worked out, although without much explanation, was for him to withdraw as a member of the board and resign."

        "Mr. Tomlinson, as chairman, sort of instigated a series of moves designed, among other things, to counter what he felt was an unwieldy liberal flavor to public broadcasting, both at PBS and at NPR so, for example, he hired a monitor to determine for PBS and NPR shows whether their guests, where they rated ideologically.",

        "The statement, which I looked at very briefly, is a statement that's critical of the situation.",
        "That basically says that the - that no government can be recognized if it doesn't fully represent the people of Zimbabwe, and that the G8 will keep on top of this.",
        "That's not bad, and I say not bad because neither the United States, nor Britain actually have the moral authority to push through sanctions - particularly in light of Iraq, and - but to say that they will stay on top of the situation, and particularly to back up the African Union and the Southern African Development Community, I think that it's a good move.",
        "And I think that, that is what's important, now the next step is really, what is the African Union willing to do, and specifically what is South Africa willing to do.",
