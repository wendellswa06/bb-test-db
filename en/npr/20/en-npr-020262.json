        "And top of all of that, you have an extensive amount of environmental devastation in the oil areas along the coast.",

        "I want to move to a final topic that is a little unusual, I mean a lot of times when we talk on our show about Africa we have a lot of kind of tough news to report, but it's not a monolithic continent in any way, and there's certainly plenty of people with wealth.",
        "And now there is a look at whether or not in-vitro fertilization, which has become very popular in the U.S.",
        "should move over to Africa, and there' a group of doctors in Europe that want to introduce lower cost in-vitro in Africa.",
        "Do you think that's a sign of either some of the wealth, or some of the changes in lifestyle that are going on the continent?",
        "I think it's probably reflective of several different things.",
        "One is, the rising power of women in Africa who are demanding changes in health care, and also demanding changes that are to their benefit.",
        "And I think that that's very important.",
        "I think that you can look at many countries in Africa and see the emergence of women's movements that are very significant.",

        "So, I think that that's one thing.",

        "You're supposed to carry certain major legacy shows for PBS, and \"\"The Wall Street Journal\"\" program is offered to all stations, and many of them do carry it, but it's not given that--quite that classification, and therefore there's less of a--sort of a--call it pressure from the system to carry it at a given time or on a given day.",
        "So what happens is a lot of local stations will carry it, but at less standard hours, or it might be in the morning on Saturdays as opposed to Friday during prime time, and therefore it does have less consistent ratings than a number of the other kind of public affairs and news programs on PBS.",
        "It may be that viewers also separately for taste reasons decide that, but that certainly seems to contribute to that.",
