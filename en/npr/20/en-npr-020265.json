        "And it's interesting, you took on this very question.",
        "You assembled a panel of, I guess, a veteran flight attendant, an etiquette expert, veteran fliers, and posed this set of questions about situations that seem to come up all the time, including the question of, do you recline the seat?",
        "Mr.",
        "McCARTNEY: That's right.",
        "And we got very different answers, which I think is sort of typical of the uncertainty people have about how they're supposed to behave on airplanes.",
        "Reclining the seat is a major issue.",
        "Seats have been pushed closer together.",
        "You have very limited space.",
        "If you want to work on your laptop and the person in front of you reclines, you may not be able to.",
        "It can really affect your experience, and people get quite militant about it.",
        "Obviously this is a overreaction, what happened Sunday night with the United flight.",
        "But there are all kinds of confrontations every day, I think, over seat reclining.",
        "And I wonder, do we give them more attention because they happen on, you know, airplanes that are in the air and sometimes have to go back to land at someplace, either where they took off from or someplace else because of a disturbance and fighter jets are involved?",
        "I mean, do we pay more attention to these than they might - than we probably should?",
        "Mr.",
        "McCARTNEY: I don't know if we pay more - we pay more attention to these kinds of episodes than other episodes in everyday life because everything gets magnified on an airplane.",
        "There are 145 other passengers on that flight who got inconvenienced.",
        "There was tremendous expense as the airplane was burning fuel for 25 minutes so it would get down to landing weight limits.",
        "And people got stranded overnight.",
        "There were military jets involved.",
        "It became a major incident because one guy slapped another on top of the head because he got upset about the seat recline.",
        "It may happen in the movie theater, but it doesn't affect everybody else in the theater.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "You mentioned the difference of response.",
        "One person says you have the right to recline, but it's nice if you check behind you and see if somebody has got their computer open or something that could spill on to their tray.",
        "Somebody else says, if the airline gives you the option to recline, that is yours.",
        "You don't need to ask permission.",
        "Mr.",
        "McCARTNEY: Yeah, and I was actually surprised by some of that.",
        "I thought people would really be more generous.",
        "Airline executives in particular said, hey, we give you the ability to recline.",
        "That's part of what you get when you buy the seat, so do what you want.",
        "Frequent travelers, on the other hand, were the ones who really were sort of opposed to reclining or at least using some care for the person behind you.",
        "Recline slowly.",
        "Some people advocated turning around and asking, hey, is it OK if I recline?",
        "I've seen some people done it myself - ask the person in front, say, you know, hey, I've got a lot of work to do.",
        "I've got to open my laptop.",
        "Would you mind not reclining the whole way so you don't smash my computer?",
        "Interesting also that there were some constructive ideas on the situation.",
        "If you're - obviously more flights are more crowded all the time, so everybody's got a problem.",
        "But if you're in the window seat and the two people next to you are asleep, what do you do if you have to go to the bathroom?"

        "She was filing a civil suit, and in the course of that suit, it emerged that there would be 13 women in all who would be willing to testify against Bill Cosby that he had essentially sexually assaulted them.",

        "That suit was subsequently settled.",
        "No terms of it were disclosed, and no charges were filed.",
        "So that's one case.",

        "And Beth Ferrier has spoken to news outlets in the past.",
        "And they all seem to tell similar stories of receiving some sort of substance from Bill Cosby and feeling strange and then later concluding that they were sexually assaulted.",
        "OK, so we have four women who've put their names on allegations.",
        "There's a number of other women described as Jane Does who were said to have made some kind of claim here.",
        "And the suit was settled in 2006, but that was a civil lawsuit concerning what would be criminal behavior if it were true.",

        "Well, a key moment occurred when the district attorney for the suburban county outside Philadelphia, at that time, said that his people had looked into these charges and found insufficient credible and admissible evidence upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be sustained beyond a reasonable doubt.",
        "Now interestingly, he also said that detectives could find no instance, quote, \"\"where anyone complained to law enforcement of conduct which would constitute a criminal offense.\"\" An interesting way to parse it, given that certainly it would seem that as part of the civil lawsuit that a number of women were willing to come forward.",
        "Now there is the matter of course of Cosby's side of this.",
        "We did not hear him say a word to Scott Simon on Saturday.",
        "But, Eric Deggans, has Cosby ever addressed these claims?",
        "He did do an interview with the National Enquirer in 2005 where he seemed to allude to - in Constand's case, specifically, that there was a misunderstanding.",
        "And he apologized for that misunderstanding and the impact on his family of the allegations.",
        "His representatives of course have denied many different claims and said that they're either the result of misunderstandings or they didn't happen at all.",
        "Now, why did this case resurface in recent days?",
        "Well, in some ways, this case has never really gone away.",
        "Whenever Bill Cosby's name comes forward in the public eye, there seems to be this sort of flurry of activity in some areas of the press and in social media to remind people that these allegations were out there.",
        "When a best-selling biography about him came to the fore, we saw websites like Gawker put up stories to remind people that allegations were out there.",
        "And the stand-up comic Hannibal Buress also had a joke in his routine where he talked about Bill Cosby being accused of rape.",
        "And that became a viral video that people passed around.",
        "And I think we have enough distance from Cosby's legacy as a superstar that there's a whole generation of people on social media who don't necessarily see him as the benevolent titan that he once was in show business and refuse to let it lie.",
        "Now, David Folkenflik, has the mainstream media that you cover struggled with how to handle the story?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I think that you've see moments where this has been covered - People magazine, the \"\"Today\"\" show and others, but even now, we're seeing a struggle to define what our standards are.",
        "Mark Whitaker, the author of that Cosby biography, decided not to address this in his book.",
        "He couldn't prove it and decided not to pursue it.",
        "But, you know, in this instance, it's kind of hard to imagine constructing a credible, you know, 360 view of this very influential and important figure's life without acknowledging that in not in one instance, there wasn't just a settled case, but that other women by name have come forward to allege this serious, serious harm being done to them by the same man.",
        "And so I think you're seeing a struggle between media new and old, between generations and also between the question of, you know, are we protecting access by not asking questions that are too uncomfortable?",
