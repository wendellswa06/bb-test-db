        "Well, let me explain it by explaining the problem a CDO solved.",
        "Let say you're investment bank and you owned a whole bunch of subprime mortgages - mortgages owned by people who don't make a lot of money, who have a really high risk of defaulting or foreclosing.",
        "And then you have all these customers who don't want risk.",
        "You have insurance companies, pension plans, people who want very safe, very sober investments.",
        "How are you going to match these two things?",
        "Well, you use something called a CDO, this collateralized debt obligation.",
        "So how does it work?",
        "What a CDO does is it pulls a whole bunch of these really high-risk assets together and what you know is - if you have thousands of subprime mortgages, you know some people are going to default, some people are going to miss payments, but you know at least some of them are going to pay on time.",
        "The estimate was, you know, something like 90 percent will pay on time each month.",
        "So you go to those pension funds and those insurance companies and you say you're first in line for the money.",
        "No matter who pays it, you'll get the money first.",
        "And so you tell them, we have converted that pool of risky assets into a very reliable, very safe, very sober stream of money, at least that was the theory.",
        "It turned out not to work.",
        "Well, what happened?",
        "Why didn't it work?",
        "Ninety percent didn't pay on time, 80 percent paid on time.",
        "And that difference is a big, big difference.",
        "We had foreclosure rates far higher than anyone had ever seen.",
        "And so the banks had to turn to their customers and say, you know, we promised you some money, were not going to be able to deliver you that money.",
        "Worst than that, the banks had held on to a lot of these themselves.",
        "They saw it as almost a risk-free way to make money.",
        "It turned out it was a high risk way to lose money.",
        "Did they lose all their money?",
        "Did these CDOs hold any value?",
        "We have absolutely no idea.",
        "And it's not that I have no idea, nobody has any idea.",
        "And the reason is this, as recently the year ago, these CDO assets were traded very freely.",
        "It was - you know, people wanted them, people were selling them and buying them.",
        "Today, you couldn't sell this for anything.",
        "Nobody wants to buy them.",
        "And when there's no market for something, there's no price for something.",
        "Nobody knows how much they're worth.",
        "So when it's earning season - when, by law, they have to say how much money they have, they take a guess.",
        "That's all they can do."

        "No, its not.",

        "Not like health care.",

        "I see poverty as a huge moral issue, issue of character for America.",

        "Helping people be able to save does cost some money.",
        "Access to college does cost some money.",
        "Creating jobs, particularly for young people in urban areas who don't have jobs, but putting them to work costs some money.",

        "What I really wanted to know was, running with two minority candidates with you, would you take either one as a running mate, and if so, do you think the pros would outweigh the cons of having a minority candidate?",
        "And Eddie, when you say minority candidates, are you speaking of Barack Obama and whom else?",

        "Ah.",
        "He was asking: How do you feel about running in a campaign against and African-American, Barack Obama; a woman, Hillary Clinton; and he says given the difficulties they face, would you accept either as a vice-presidential candidate should you win the nomination?",
        "Well I'll answer the latter first, and then I'll go to the heart of the question.",
        "I think either of them, if I were to be successful, and I believe I will be - but if I were to be successful in the nomination process, either of them would be very serious candidates for the vice presidency.",
        "I have a high opinion of both.",
        "As to the fact that Senator Obama is African-American and Senator Clinton is a woman, I'll just say this in the simplest language I know how to every Democratic primary voter who hears my voice right now.",
        "If you're considering not voting for Senator because she's a woman or Senator Obama because he's black, you shouldn't vote for me, because I think that having real diversity both in the candidates and in the campaign and in an administration, in my administration, is the heart and soul of who I am.",
        "So I just felt the need to say that."

        "I've already begun with that and laid out a plan to straighten the middle class and to end poverty as we know it in the next 30 years, the first candidate with a universal health-care plan, laid out a clear plan for what we should be doing in leaving Iraq, including engaging the Syrians and the Iranians directly.",
        "So I will run a positive campaign.",
        "I will tell the truth about - the truth as I see it.",
        "I think everyone deserves to hear that.",
        "And then finally, I do want people to know, who are voting in the caucuses and in the primaries, to know exactly what it is I stand for so that they can make a judgment, up or down, on whether I should be the next president.",

        "Would you be more aggressive should you win the nomination?",
        "Well, I wouldn't apply it just to the general election.",
        "I think it applies across the board.",
        "There is a maturity and a depth that comes from having been through being in the spotlight of a national campaign, and also some of the things that have happened since that campaign in my own experience and in my family's life.",
        "Elizabeth's gone through breast-cancer treatment; and I've been all over the world doing humanitarian work in Africa, plus engaging in people in all parts of the world and taking concrete steps to raise the minimum wage in six states - we worked very hard on that; to make college available to kids who were willing to work in - for what we call a College for Everyone Program that we put in place and raised the money for privately.",
        "I helped organize thousands of workers into unions.",
        "So I think that there is a maturity and a toughness and a seasoning that comes through, from going through what I've gone through, which - we all evolve, and it makes me, I think, a much stronger candidate.",
        "Here's an e-mail question from Laura(ph) in Baltimore.",
