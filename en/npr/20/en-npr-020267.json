        "It would be a much more efficient, much more - less costly system because we eliminate a large percentage of the administrative costs.",
        "She would have the option of not just a private insurer or a group of insurers, but a government plan similar to what the Congress - senators and congressman have available to them.",
        "And then finally, if she - depending on what her income level is, if she's lower income or unemployed, she would be fully subsidized in her health-care coverage.",
        "As she goes up the income ladder and more strongly and up into the upper-middle class, the subsidies become reduced, and there is a place at about $90,000 to $100,000 a year where the subsidies stop.",

        "The suggestion is on the reversal of the tax cuts, instead of calling it a tax increase, call it for what it is: reversing a mistake when they gave welfare to the rich.",

        "So there are a whole group of things we need to do, but we need a serious plan to deal with at least the potential that this could go completely bad.",
