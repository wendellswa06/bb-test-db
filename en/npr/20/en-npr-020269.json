        "You know, you have to remember, you have to be very careful, you're going to startle somebody.",
        "And I thought that was really good advice.",
        "Also good advice, you know, the issue comes up about children kicking seats or, you know, how do you police that.",
        "And I thought the best advice was not trying to discipline somebody else's child and not trying to be - put the parent of the child in a defensive posture..."
