        "And this new evidence adds to the evidence that too much sitting is potentially bad for our health.",
        "And how much sitting do you have to do to start noticing there's a problem?",
        "Well, I guess, within this study, you've already mentioned some of the findings, but another key finding was that when we compared people who watch less than two hours of television per day, people who watch more than four hours a day had a 46 percent higher risk of death from all causes and an 80 percent increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease.",
        "So it appears that the higher amounts of TV significantly increase the risk.",
        "Forty-six percent, four hours a day.",
        "That - you know, the statistics in the United States are showing that the average person watches about five hours of TV a day here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And within Australia, our average is around about the three hours per day.",
        "So it does have serious implications, particularly for the U.S., for the population where, you know, TV viewing is substantially higher than what exists here in Australia.",
        "So if you're not sitting on the couch, if you just stand up and walk around or - that would be okay while you're watching television."
