        "I think one of the things that's been lacking is having one agency acting as a public health leader in this crisis.",

        "I think what the stories that have not been told about the Ebola outbreak - is the impact Ebola has had on the health infrastructure in these countries.",
        "So there's thousands of people that have been infected and died from being infected with Ebola.",
        "But no one's talking about the many more thousands that are dying because their malaria's not being treated.",
        "Their tuberculosis is not be treated.",
        "And one of the ironies is that when a patient goes to a clinic and they have a complaint - maybe they have typhoid disease, or they have fevers because of a chronic cough - they are shipped off to the Ebola unit as a suspect.",
        "So not only are they not being treated for what they came to the clinic for, but they now are in a isolation unit and potentially being exposed to Ebola.",
        "So one of the things that I prioritized when I was working at Kenema General Hospital is going into the initial unit and seeing those patients and really trying to get a rapid diagnosis on them so we could get them out of the unit before they were exposed to someone who may have Ebola.",
        "That's Dr. Suzanne Donovan.",

        "So what we've tended to underestimate is the true benefit that can be derived from this incidental or this non-sweaty type movement, because what we've seen is that the more you move, the greater the likely benefits for your health.",
        "What goes on in your body to make just these simple movements?",
        "You don't have to be aerobic, as you're saying, you just have to move around a bit.",
        "What's going on in your body to help you?",
        "Well, the possible explanation for this really comes down to the muscles moving.",
        "And when we're sitting for prolonged periods, we're not burning up much energy.",
        "And it appears that television contributes to an overall reduction in the amount of calories that we burn throughout the day.",
        "In fact, there are studies that have actually shown that when we're sitting watching television, we burn as much energy as what we do when we're sleeping or at rest.",
        "So it's very low energy expenditure, and over a period of, you know, four or five hours, that's quite low energy expenditure.",
        "The other consequence that we're starting to understand now is that when we're sitting for prolonged times such as, you know, in front of the television or long hours in front of the computer screen at a desk, there's an absence of muscle contractions.",
        "And there's extensive evidence that indicates that muscle contractions are so essential for many of the body's regulatory processes - for example, the breaking down and using of glucose.",
        "So when we're remaining idle for prolonged periods, we're disrupting those body's typical regulatory processes.",
        "So get off your chair and get up and move is what you're saying.",
        "Get out of the car, take a walk.",
        "Just something - a little bit, doesn't - you don't have to, you know, do a lot of sweaty exercise is what you're saying.",
        "Well, I think the important point here that this does not negate the important benefits of undertaking regular exercise.",
        "There's substantial evidence that exercise is important.",
        "But what we now have to take stock at is looking at - what are we doing when we're not exercising or we're not sleeping, which for many of us, even if we exercise for 30 minutes to 60 minutes of the day, that still leaves 15 hours of the day - if we sleep eight hours, that is - for this non-exercise time, non-sleeping time.",
        "So what we're trying to encourage people is to think about avoiding prolonged periods of sitting, move more, more often.",
        "So you're saying that even people who you studied who are really good exercisers, who are very active and they exercised, you know, like we see most people telling us that we should be doing, and they're on the treadmill or whatever, even those people, when they sat down for awhile, they fell right into that category.",
        "And this is a really interesting finding, and that is the case.",
        "And what we did, we factored in people's exercise levels into our analyses.",
        "And even when we factored that in, the relationship between TV remained robust.",
        "That is, it persisted even when we account for people's exercise levels, which I think this indicates that you can still exercise, but spend higher amounts of the remainder of the day sedentary, or you can still watch significantly high amounts of television, with more - the higher amounts of television led to the increased risk.",

        "I think you might have answered it already -does it make a difference if you're just sitting and reading a book?",
        "You know, television was used as the model in the study, but I guess just sitting and reading a book would have the same effect.",
        "No, that's a good point.",
        "And as you indicated, within the study we specifically focused on television because we had previously seen that to be a good indicator of a person's overall sedentary behavior pattern.",
        "I guess the message that I come back to again here...",
        "Right.",
        "...is that it's the sitting time that appears to be detrimental to health, and of course prolonged sitting while I'm reading, great for the mind...",
        "Right.",

        "We often get asked, so what can we do if we want to watch our favorite TV show?",

        "Yeah, that's a very good point.",
        "And we did account the people's diet overall in terms of their diet quality.",
        "And even when we accounted for that, the relationship still persisted.",
        "But what there has been evidence earlier, from other studies, is that increased poor snacking may take place with television viewing due to the, you know, the cues that people have through commercial breaks and television shows.",
        "But we didn't address that, or we haven't addressed that just yet.",

        "And we asked them to sit for the seven hours.",
        "But on another day we asked them to sit but we get them up every 20 minutes for two minutes, to see whether that interruption can lead to more favorable blood glucose levels, blood fat levels.",
        "So I think it's stay tuned for that one, because that's where we're currently working on.",
