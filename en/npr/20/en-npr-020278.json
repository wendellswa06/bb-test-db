        "A bizarre situation.",

        "Okay.",

        "...it seams that the league and the team were both a little slow off the mark on this.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "The league in a sense - and David Stern said this when he suspended Arenas yesterday, he had been kind of withholding any action which has been, you know, the behavior of the NBA when past situations like this have arisen.",
        "He was holding off because this was a law enforcement matter and he wanted to see how the legal case was playing out.",
        "But then as you mentioned, particularly the Tuesday night incident before the Philadelphia game when Gilbert Arenas was shooting fake pistols at his teammates, that was too much for David Stern.",
        "He said, you know, he said, that's it, I'm suspending him indefinitely without pay.",
        "This guy, Arenas, doesn't belong on an NBA court.",
        "And there are strictures in the collective bargaining agreement with the players union about when and who can suspend a player without pay.",
        "But nevertheless, the team could have said, wait a minute.",
        "While this is being investigated, Gilbert Arenas, so why don't you just sit there on the bench and not play?",
        "One would have thought so.",
        "And one would have thought so with the history of the Wizards as well.",
        "As you've well known, the late owner, Abe Pollin, who, you know, changed the name of the team largely because of - he changed the name of the team from the Bullets to the Wizards because of the violent crime rates in Washington and the assassination of his friend, the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin."

        "So with that as backdrop, you would have thought that the Wizards would have stepped in a lot sooner in their statement after Commissioner Stern acted.",

        "But yeah, it seems like it was a little slow off the mark.",

        "You know, the big - the distinction people are making there is he fired a gun inadvertently.",
        "You know, he shot himself in the thigh, but a gun did discharge.",
        "Nevertheless, D.C.",
        "takes very seriously its gun laws.",
        "A superior court reportedly - a grand jury is reviewing the case.",
        "And according to reports, Arenas could face up to 20 years in prison on felony charges of carrying handguns without a license, so some very serious potential charges.",
        "He could be facing those.",
        "Plaxico Burress, the New York Giants' former player is currently in prison serving, I think, a one-year sentence in connection with those gun charges in New York when he did bring a gun - a loaded gun into a club and discharged it into his thigh."

        "As far as we know, Tom, has this kind of thing happened in the NBA locker rooms before?",
        "Well, certainly not in the NBA locker rooms.",
        "And in the 2005 agreement between the league and the players unions, the collective - the process of collective bargaining with the contract, they made the language much tougher on firearms situations and they said that players can be disciplined if they bring a firearm, you know, to the practice court, to the actual arena, even on promotional appearances.",
