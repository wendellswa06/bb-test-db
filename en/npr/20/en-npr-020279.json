        "Yes.",
        "But a very, very serious situation, certainly in the workplace, you know.",

        "In Gilbert Arenas' statement yesterday, responding to the suspension, he said, I understand it or - excuse me, he said - or someone writing it for him said I understand it and I made the NBA look bad.",

        "But nevertheless, this is a man who signed a contract for over $100 million.",

        "He is the team's leading scorer, but frankly, insiders will tell you that they would love to be rid of that contract.",
        "And so - and to kind of free money up for the big 2010 free agent extravaganza that's about to be upon us, which offers players such as LeBron James and other top-playing players, Wizards would love to have a crack at someone like that.",

        "He negotiated that contract himself.",

        "Yeah, definitely.",
        "They're watching all of this.",

        "But certainly, they're going to watch and, you know, and defend the rights of a player if they feel that those rights are being violated.",
        "And we - you talked about the league's image as a thug league, and this goes back to several incidents: the brawl in Detroit a couple of years ago, where players went up into the stands and actually got involved in a fracas with fans.",
        "And there are other respects here - the league clearly would like to focus on what's going on on the court, on the great basketball that some teams are playing.",

        "You know what, Neal?",
        "I had a sick thought the other day, that the guy is really smiling as Tiger Woods, because it only took three weeks for that scandle to be off the front pages, although Tiger will be back."

        "And then just the lack of information as to how we got here and what these conditions came from - that - those are the troubling parts to me.",
