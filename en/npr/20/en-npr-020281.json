        "I understand the pilots have screening, medical screening, once or twice a year.",
        "Does that also include psychological screening?",
        "Well, pilots undergo medical evaluation either once or twice a year, depending on if you're a captain, first officer and sometimes even which aircraft you're assigned to.",
        "The evaluation doesn't include a psychological exam per se.",
        "But the doctor, who is FAA-certified, certainly can make a subjective evaluation of any pilot's psychological makeup and go from there.",
        "As a pilot, are you asked specifically in that screening: Are you seeing a therapist?",
        "Are you taking antidepressants, for example?",
        "Yes, you are asked those questions directly.",
        "And it is part of the form that you fill out every time you go for your annual or biannual evaluation.",
        "I saw in a statement from the FAA about their policy, this phrase: We depend on the honesty of pilots, along with their friends and family and co-workers, to get pilots the help they need.",
        "Does that seem sufficient to you?",
        "Does that seem like a reasonable approach?",
        "It's not a whole lot different from in any other profession and, indeed, safety-sensitive professions across the board.",
        "One issue I think that's important to raise here is, if for any reason a pilot becomes incapacitated, you know, there are always at least two fully qualified pilots on board if the captain is incapacitated.",
        "You know, the first officer - the co-pilot, if you will - is not just an apprentice.",
        "Co-pilots perform as many takeoffs and landings as captains do, and they're qualified to fly the airplane in all regimes of flight.",
        "I'm looking at the FAA policy on antidepressants, which changed a couple of years ago.",
        "And they are now allowing pilots to fly if they're taking four types of antidepressants.",
        "But as they begin that treatment, though, they're grounded for one year.",
        "And I wonder if that is a disincentive for people to self-report, to say I'm taking antidepressants, if they know they're not going to be able to fly for a year.",
        "I don't think so.",
        "I mean, I think airlines tend to be a lot more proactive about these sorts of things than people give them credit for.",
        "One corollary to this maybe is what's known as the HEMS program, which is a program where pilots who are having alcohol issues can voluntarily enter this program and get the situation straightened out.",
        "That program has a very, very good track record over the years."

        "Somewhat.",

        "But, yeah, it's come up over the past day and a half or so.",

        "I'm not surprised this story is in the news.",
        "It was an unusual incident.",

        "I mean, and those things are common if you're traversing cross-country for, you know, 30, 60 days, that makes sense.",

        "And, to me, that's not correct because throughout my career, as I say again, and working in different places going back to 2014, the agents were the ones who would bring diapers and food and water and bake cakes for the kids that were in our custody before the public was in this uproar about it.",
        "We were the ones that were caring for them - bringing bottled water and bottled milk to these kids.",

        "Is it clear to you how it's supposed to work?",
        "I mean, for example, there's this judicial ruling that bars children from being held in adult detention facilities for an extended amount of time.",
        "Have you gotten any new guidance on how this should work since this order was signed?",
        "For us, it will allow the families to stay together and be together throughout the process.",
        "Now, the question is - and it's going to have to be decided in the courts - is whether or not that can be longer than 20 days.",
        "Because that's what that decision said is that you can't hold minors in our detention facilities longer than 20 days.",
        "And, sometimes, that process takes longer than 20 days.",
        "So no one is quite clear on what will happen then.",
        "Will the family unit be released, or will they just continue to hold the entire family unit beyond that 20 days?",

        "OK.",
        "So let me ask you, though, what do you say to people who say to you you shouldn't be participating in it?",
        "What do you say?",
        "Then I would challenge them with the fact that we are taking in people that have risked rape, robbery, assault, murder, have spent their life savings and given it to a criminal cartel to get them to the United States.",
