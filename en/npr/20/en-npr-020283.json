        "Right.",
        "Well, in what ways are they similar?",
        "Well, the two big ways are, one, predictability--that is to say, Alito has a very, very well, very evolved and worked out jurisprudential theory.",
        "His philosophy is like Scalia's, so you sort of are not really surprised by his votes in cases.",
        "That stands in sharp contrast to Harriet Miers.",
        "But more profoundly that predictability tends to be in a very, very conservative direction, so you get cases in which he votes to strike down federal laws banning the possession of machine guns, votes from him expanding police search powers to include even such things as strip searches, and probably the most controversial decision we're going to hear a lot about is a vote in 1991 to uphold a Pennsylvania law that would have very, very severely restricted women's ability to get abortions, including a provision that would have required that they notify their spouse.",
        "That was later struck down by the US Supreme Court in its Casey decision, but Alito would have taken a much stronger position than the Supreme Court ultimately took against abortion.",
        "The 1991 case is indeed on the records.",
        "Staying with abortion here, are there other examples of situations where Judge Alito would differ from the court's position on Roe v.",
        "Wade, let's say?",
        "Well, the crucial thing in that 1991 case, Noah, was that there was a provision that said married women need to go to their husbands for their consent, and Alito wrote a rather shocking opinion where he said there's all sorts of reasons that the state could say that that's true and that the sort of alleged problem--I think he used the word `perceived' problems--that women can't go to their husbands would usually be resolved by discussing it.",
        "I think that shows a sort of shocking lack of understanding about a lot of the very, very difficult and fraught situations in which women can't go to their husbands and obtain their consent, and I think that is a real red flag for people who care a lot about abortion rights because it suggests to him that he'd be willing to go along with the state rationale even when that rationale sort of flies in the face of common sense."
