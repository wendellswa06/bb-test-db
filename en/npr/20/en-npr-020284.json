        "He says the story that follows the sisters and their grandmother, played by Shirley MacLaine, has universal appeal.",
        "We are encouraged to see them the way they see themselves.",
        "You know, Maggie is someone who's been able to cruise by in life based on what she looks like.",
        "Rose, on the other hand, her sister, is an overachiever.",
        "She's somebody who took on responsibility at a very early age and basically has denied herself the opportunity to discover who she is.",
        "Ella, their grandmother, is hiding from life, unable to care for herself.",
        "In this sense, what you have are three people who are uncomfortable in their own shoes, and it's that journey to become comfortable with who they are that the story is really about.",
        "The relationship and the chemistry between the two sisters, it would seem to be so important.",
        "So how is it that you found just the right actresses for this and how did you finally settle on Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette?",
        "Well, actually when the script was sent to me Cameron was already interested potentially in being in it.",
        "Who better than Cameron Diaz to play this character, who has been allowed to cruise by in life based on what she looks like?",
        "The question that I had: Was she fully prepared to go to the dark side of Maggie to play the fear and insecurity that lurked behind that beautiful image?",
        "And when she and I got together and talked about the character and the movie it could be, we found ourselves finishing each other's sentences and just decided to team up immediately.",
        "Toni Collette came next, and that involved getting Toni over here from Australia and putting her in a room with Cameron and just seeing how the two of them connected.",
        "And their...",
        "What happened when you put them in the room together?",
        "It was very interesting 'cause they didn't know each other.",
        "It started with a little bit of a discussion about the script, but then it very quickly evolved into a discussion about personal things.",
        "And it was as though I wasn't even there, which I liked.",
        "It was like being in the girls' locker room for--as a fly on the wall as these two were having this amazingly intimate conversation after only knowing each other literally a few minutes."

        "You are big in your talent.",
        "What would happen if you played this character who is hiding from life, who is small in every way?",
        "I could just see her eyes lighting up as she was not only absorbing what I was saying about Ella, the character, but she was also, I felt, taking what I was saying as a challenge.",

        "Women's participation in South Korean politics is low, but growing.",
        "Korean society was a Confucian society traditionally and women, although they are very active, bright and, you know, have great talent, there have been some implicit and hidden feeling."

        "And as you heard on Tuesday night, he said that Senator Obama is a young man buying into old liberal ideas.",

        "Back in February of '06, Obama and McCain were members of a task force across party lines that was trying to put together some legislation on ethics reform, disclosure, working with lobbyists, things that are bound to come up again because of the lobbyist issue inside the McCain campaign.",

        "He preferred the Democratic version and bought out of the deal.",

        "It was a rare public rebuke from one Senator to another.",
        "And the two really have been sort of icy towards each for some time - again, as compared to what has been a fairly good relationship between Hillary Clinton and John McCain.",

        "What exactly does that all mean?",
        "Well, it means that she retains control of her delegates to the convention.",
        "And this serves two purposes, Renee.",
        "One is it means that she has some control going into that first round of voting at the convention in Denver.",
        "And also potentially it would help her with the vice presidential bid, because you've got to come to her to play on many issues - platform issues to more - as the Obama camp tries to take control of the convention.",
        "And secondly, it might help her with fund raising going forward.",
        "Because she's still got to campaign and can say that she's raising money for her campaign.",
        "Well, Juan, does this allow the party to - as it wants to do - unite behind Senator Obama or does Senator McCain have a chance here to win some of Hillary Clinton's supporters?",
        "He's already working at winning those supporters, especially women.",
        "I don't know if you heard some of his comments over the last few days.",
