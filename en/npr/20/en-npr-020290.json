        "And once the parents were in jail, the children could not go with them, thus we had family separation.",

        "They say that the country could still have border security and immigration courts like we do now - immigration courts are civil proceedings - but without criminalizing the migrants and the asylum-seekers who are coming here and fleeing from violence.",
        "The moderates say there's a better way to get rid of family separation, and that is simply to get rid of President Trump.",
        "The moderates worry that decriminalizing border crossings would encourage more migrants to come, and I think they're worried about the political optics of this, as well, right?",
        "President Trump already says frequently that Democrats are for, quote, \"\"open borders,\"\" which Democrats deny.",

        "Well, there's the political reason, and then there's the sort of real policy issues.",
