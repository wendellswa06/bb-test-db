        "FINA, who are the international board for swimming - regulators for swimming, banned that suit, but they remained - the world record stood.",
        "However, what's happened this time round is that they've introduced a swim system, if you like.",
        "So that's a swimming costume and goggles and an integrated hat, which they've actually developed taking a 3-D scanned image of the athlete and produced sort of a tailor-made solution.",
        "And because they've been engaged with FINA early on in discussing how that's going to affect their performance, they've been allowed to use these suits within the London 2012 games.",
        "If you allow special swimsuits, and you allow special caps - and I mean this in all seriousness - won't we see some day when you can put swim fins on and use those also as assisted aids?",

        "So this will increase the speed of all athletes.",
        "Also you'll see changes in the helmet design to make that more aerodynamic.",
        "So that's been done through 3-D modeling and computational fluid dynamics to look at the flow of how the air goes over to ensure that you're getting that full potential from the athletes.",
        "And in reading about the things that are being changed, I was fascinated to learn that you design a swimming pool and to make the water faster.",
        "How do you make the water faster?",
        "(Unintelligible) said that you can make the water faster.",
        "There are various things that people can do to, say, change the density of the water so you can reduce the drag on the athlete.",
        "But also, you know, you can change (unintelligible) that was one of the issues with the Lazer swimsuit, which was why it was banned, because it was thought that a full-body swimsuit sort of held the swimmer in all the right places to make them more hydrodynamic, which is again why we say the athletes - the engineers have to work with the regulators to make sure that that's not happening.",

        "I believe that they are going to have that at 25-degree Celsius temperature rather than 20 degrees because that can increase the speed of the bike.",
        "So they think (unintelligible) an advantage of about 1.4 seconds over four kilometers.",
        "So - but I mean the thing about that is it benefits all athletes.",
        "If they are doing changes to the swimming pool, it is, again, something that will obviously affect all athletes and won't pick out particular athletes or benefit particular athletes.",
        "And as far 3-D printing, I hear that's made its way into the Olympics?"
