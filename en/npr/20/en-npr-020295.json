        "And actually, when I used to go home at about midday to sleep, everyone was in work still, so it was very quiet.",

        "One of the important qualities in baking that you talk about in this book is the importance of touch.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "I mean, in this world of health and safety, I remember - there's a lot of, you know, they try and encourage the bakers to wear gloves - rubber gloves when you're kneading bread.",
        "I mean, what?",
        "I mean, this is one of the oldest traditions in the world.",
        "And to get bakers to wrap up their hands so they can't feel the dough - it's that touch, which you cannot teach - it's something you have to practice, practice, practice and get used to.",

        "And my mum used to make them quite a lot actually, mainly over the weekend.",
        "But they were so delicious - a bit cookie-like.",
        "And what I mean by that is there's syrup in there, so it bakes fairly quickly and leaving moisture.",
        "So when you cook this mixture out in a pan - which is what you do to heat it up - and then you roll the little balls in your hand, flatten them down, bake them off - and they're absolutely delicious.",
        "So they're slightly crispy on the outside and a little bit chewy on the inside, so it's almost cookie-like.",
        "And they, really, were the first time I ever baked, certainly baked in my life with my mother as well.",
        "It was fantastic.",
        "My mother was very much a good - she was a very good pastry chef.",
        "My dad was a professional baker.",
        "So between the two of them, they had, you know, a lot of information they could pass on to me.",
        "But the initial baking - that's where it all started really - in the - with the ginger biscuits.",
        "And that, with a cup of tea, is very difficult to beat.",

        "And the ganache is basically just chocolate cream.",
        "Normally, when you're dealing in a plain chocolate, so you can do 50-50.",
        "So 50 percent cream, 50 percent chocolate and just leave it to melt - and then pour it all over a cake.",
        "It sets, and you get a beautiful shine.",
        "You've got to be careful when you're setting it, and that's where it came from.",
