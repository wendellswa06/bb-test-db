        "And I think the - a number of Republican, including Senator McCain, said they just put themselves in an impossible position by saying no on too many things.",

        "Yes.",

        "It was co-hosted both by Vice President Biden and Secretary Clinton.",
        "And Biden, in the beginning of his toast, said what is normal in these sorts of events, which is the importance of long-term relationship, how valuable it was for both countries to have these 40 years of interaction since Richard Nixon's opening, et cetera, et cetera.",
        "And then he spent the second half of his remarks giving a very detailed list of the concerns and complaints the United States have, ranging from China's veto with Russia of the Syrian resolution in the United Nations towards intellectual property theft and currency evaluation and things like that.",
        "In real time, Mr. Xi seems somewhat taken aback.",
        "He had his own prepared toast, which was anodyne and positive, although the next day, he did give a more substantive response about China's view on these same issues.",
        "But I think, in perspective, it was an indication of the constancy of U.S.-China relations, where the United States has tried to say that, on the one hand, it recognizes that it's better to be China's friend than its enemy.",
        "And it welcomes China's emergence.",
        "But on the other hand, there are a lot of areas where we really do deeply disagree.",
        "Let's touch just briefly on some sad news from this week, the death in Syria of The New York Times reporter Anthony Shadid.",
        "His colleagues were lining up to call him the most gifted foreign correspondent in a generation.",
        "I know him only through his work, not personally.",

        "One of the biggest issues in this year's presidential elections is going to be health care - who gets it, who uses it, and who pays for it.",
        "And we got some new numbers this week from the federal government to help us understand what's at stake.",
        "For example, we learned that America spent $2.6 trillion on health care in 2010.",
        "That's a little more than $8,000 per person.",
        "But we also learned, in a separate study, that people don't actually spend health-care dollars equally.",
        "In fact, half the population uses so little health care that they only account for about 3 percent of the nation's health-care spending.",
        "With us to help process all this, and what it might mean on the campaign trail, is NPR health policy correspondent Julie Rovner.",
        "Hello, Julie.",
        "Hey, Audie.",
        "So half the population uses almost no health care in any individual year.",
        "So where are all these dollars going?",
        "Well, they're going to do very sickest people.",
        "In 2009, the top 1 percent of the population accounted for just under 22 percent of all health-care spending.",
        "The top 5 percent of the population spent nearly half of all health-care dollars.",
        "So what do we actually know about those people, other than the fact that they have extremely high medical bills and are probably very sick?",
        "Well, this particular study looked at the people who've stayed in that top part of the spending curve in both 2008 and 2009.",
        "And it found that they were much more likely to be elderly, more likely to be women, more likely to be white, and more likely to have public health-insurance coverage.",
        "Conversely, those who spent the least were - not surprisingly - more likely to be in good or excellent health but also, younger people, Hispanics and African-Americans.",
        "So what does a study like this mean, politically?",
        "I guess, what are the implications there?",
        "Well, Jews were in Libya from at least the 1st century.",
        "They were under the Romans and under the Ottomans.",
        "In 1911, the Italians wrestled Libya from the Ottomans, and it became an Italian colony.",
        "Eventually, it was taken over by the British.",
        "And finally, it became an independent country in 1951."
