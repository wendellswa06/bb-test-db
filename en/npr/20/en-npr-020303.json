        "Hi.",
        "We've just heard about what's in the report.",
        "You've read this 24-page report from the House committee.",
        "What was your reaction when you saw what was in it?",
        "Well, it's bonker-balls (ph).",
        "Bonker-balls (laughter)...",
        "Yeah, to use a...",

        "No, it's an NPR term.",
        "But you know, I can't come up with a better word.",
        "It's one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.",
        "It's a half-baked, grandiose plan with all kinds of things that could go wrong in it and people screaming at them to stop.",
        "And they don't stop.",
        "Well, just to explain why this plan was so problematic - I mean, Saudi Arabia has signed on to a Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, meaning they've committed under international law to not developing nuclear weapons.",
        "So why is it so problematic?",
        "Why are there obstacles to the U.S.",
        "selling civilian nuclear energy technology to a country like Saudi Arabia?",
        "Well, you know, it really depends on the kind of technology.",
        "If you're just talking about a reactor that produces power, then you know, that's a normal thing, and that might make a lot of sense.",
        "But one of the things that the Obama administration was trying to push the Saudis on was to agree not to either enrich uranium or what's called reprocess the spent fuel.",
        "And those are basically the technologies that can be used in energy but are also used to build a bomb.",
        "So I think people are very concerned that that kind of technology might have gone through.",
        "When you look at what's described in this report, we've heard that it raises legal and ethical concerns.",
        "To you, are the primary concerns ethical, like this could be a bad idea, or legal, like this could actually be a crime?"

        "The U.S., Europe and Russia all appear to be willing to wait a little while longer, which may not be a weakness in this case, because, says Abbas Milani, the degree of confusion and disarray among Irans leaders is unprecedented.",

        "It doesn't matter if she's a poor black girl in the middle of the 'hood or one of the most famous and probably commercially successful artists on the planet.",
        "She's still a black girl and she's still responsible for every single thing that may happen to her in life.",
        "And so, she says, young black women tell themselves they're invincible, in spite of the data on domestic abuse.",
        "It's a bit of a contradiction or, to McCauley, a coping mechanism.",
        "If they admit that a young black woman like Rihanna, at the top of her game, can be abused, they have to admit it can happen to them.",
        "To not blame Rihanna is to acknowledge that they, as young girls, are vulnerable, too.",
        "McCauley says admitting they're at risk would shatter the myth of the strong black woman so many of these girls have come to internalize.",
        "But she says it's not all their fault.",
        "We don't have conversations with girls about violence.",

        "After what seemed like a promising start, international talks on Irans uranium stockpile have come to a halt.",
        "At the beginning of October, Iran agreed in principal to ship most of its low-grade enriched uranium to Russia and France for processing into nuclear fuel.",
        "That fuel was to be sent back to Iran for use in a reactor that produces medical isotopes.",
        "So it was a medical use.",
        "Since then, though, Irans government has been backpedaling on this deal.",
        "The U.S.",
        "and Europe have been patient, though, perhaps because Iran cannot acquire that reactor fuel without their help.",
        "NPR Newss Mike Shuster reports.",
        "The crucial meeting where the deal was set was in Geneva on October 1st.",
        "Irans top nuclear negotiator was there, along with European, Russian and Chinese diplomats.",
        "The U.S.",
        "was represented by an undersecretary of state.",
        "The problem facing the Iranians is their research reactor in Tehran, which produces isotopes used to treat cancer and is running out of fuel.",
        "So they agreed to an American proposal to ship more than a ton of their low-enriched uranium to Russia and France to be turned into more reactor fuel.",
        "As a benefit for the U.S.",
        "and its allies, doing this would remove most of Irans current enriched uranium stockpile as a possible route to acquiring a nuclear weapon.",
        "More meetings followed in Vienna, but, says Abbas Milani, director of Iran Studies at Stanford University, hardliners in Tehran have steadily chipped away at support for the deal.",
        "I think the Iranian regime is beginning serious backtracking and rethinking the agreements that they seem to have agreed to in Geneva."

        "Right now, though, Tehran appears to be resisting all the international pleas.",

        "He notes that Irans government has been under sharp political pressure internally since the disputed presidential election in June spawned an enormous and very determined opposition movement.",
        "At the same time, the international pressure over its nuclear program was threatening to bring about more economic sanctions.",
        "Dealing with both challenges simultaneously may be too much for Irans embattled leaders.",
        "To make matters worse for Irans government, it faces a technical problem it may not be able to overcome on its own.",
        "Although Iran does have a considerable amount of low-enriched uranium, Muhammad Sahimi points out it does not have the capability to turn it into fuel rods for the Tehran research reactor.",
        "Iran is not known to have any technology right now available in Iran that can produce the fuel rods.",
        "So Iran can delay or stall all it wants, but that simply gets them closer to the day when it will run out of the capacity to produce medical isotopes.",
        "This may be why Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Berlin earlier this week seemed so patient with Iran.",
        "We believe that this offer represents an important opportunity for Iran both to meet the medical and humanitarian needs that the Tehran research reactor fulfills and to begin to restore international confidence in their nuclear program."
