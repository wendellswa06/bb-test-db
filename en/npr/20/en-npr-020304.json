        "Jumping feet first into the digital world, Scholastic began working on technology-driven reading programs.",

        "David Pearson is a professor in the Graduate School of Education at UC Berkley who has published his own educational programs with a different company.",
        "Pearson says the education community is often critical of some of the commercial educational programs on the market because they feel they depend more on market research than educational research.",
        "But he says Scholastic's work is generally well received.",
        "Clearly, they are driven by market forces.",
        "But I think they also pay a lot of attention to the latest research, particularly in their field on language and literacy learning.",
        "But like any good entrepreneurial American company, they're out to make a buck.",
        "Scholastic may be out to make a buck but the company also says it is committed to worldwide literacy.",
        "It's a heady goal, which Dick Robinson says dovetails perfectly with the business of selling kids books.",
        "I don't think there is a conflict in any way between our mission and our business.",
        "In fact, they're united together in the necessity, really, of children acquiring reading skills, learning more about the world and learning more about themselves through reading.",
        "Robinson says Scholastic has hewed closely to his father's original goal, to help people understand society and how it works.",
        "He says his father wanted to do that more than he wanted make money.",
        "The fact that Scholastic is now worth billions is just an added bonus.",

        "When it does that, it makes a toxic compound.",
        "And so the plant has to detoxify it.",
