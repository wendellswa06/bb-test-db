        "Because Senator Kennedy, certainly, he's been in public life now for more than 40 years, and he's saying, hey, the guy looks good enough to me.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, here is someone who is the second-longest serving Democratic senator in history.",
        "This is someone who cannot be lightly swept aside as just having been caught up in an emotional moment.",
        "And the Clintons really, as we all know, fought against this.",
        "Here's a clip of Senator Kennedy speaking today.",
        "Every time I've been asked over the past year who I would support in the Democratic primary, my answer has always been the same.",
        "I'll support the candidate who inspires me, who inspires all of us, who can lift our vision and summon our hopes and renew our belief that our country's best days are still to come.",
        "That's Senator Kennedy speaking at the endorsement in Washington.",
        "Ron, you mentioned the effort of the Clintons to get the senator to stay neutral.",
        "I read about that in the papers today.",
        "I also read that Senator Kennedy was angry at President Bill Clinton and the way he's been campaigning on behalf of his wife.",
        "He's angry enough, I guess, to talk to the New York Times and the Washington Post about it.",
        "I mean, this is just coming out.",
        "It has been deeply disturbing to a lot of Democrats who had been big Bill Clinton supporters, and I would emphasize here particularly among many African-Americans.",
        "It's been a big deal for them the way the Clintons turned on Barack Obama after losing the Iowa caucuses.",
        "Now let me give you an example.",
        "On Saturday, when the results were coming in from South Carolina, Bill Clinton was asked a question by a reporter on another subject.",
        "And he came back with this answer: You know, Jesse Jackson won in South Carolina in 1984 and in 1988.",
        "Now, what was he trying to say?",
        "He was trying to say that in 1984 and 1988, Jesse Jackson, who went nowhere in the long run as far as getting the nomination, was able to win South Carolina, clearly because it's a state where there's a very strong black voting population.",
        "And that means it's a black thing; it may not really matter at all that much in the long run.",
        "He was shrugging it off, and he was shrugging it off in terms I don't think anyone could fail to find racial in their nature.",
        "And I hope, of course, that will disrupt their operations on the battlefield.",
        "Do you see any indication of that yet?",
        "Is there any way to gauge how thats playing out?",
        "And since our opponents in this presidential election seem to look down at that experience, let me explain to them what the job involves.",

        "The delegates here went wild last night.",

        "And so she reminded them what Obama had once said at a San Francisco fundraiser.",
        "I might add that in small towns we don't quite know what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working people when they're listening and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns when those people aren't listening.",

        "You know, we tend to prefer candidates who don't talk about us one way in Scranton and another way in San Francisco.",
        "(Soundbite of applause)",
        "Choosing Palin was a gamble; a sign that McCain is willing to move away from running on experience and compete directly with Obama for the mantle of change.",
        "Palin described herself as an outsider, saying I'm not a member of the permanent political establishment, and she talked about something that's been overwhelmed by the frenzy about her family: what she actually did as governor of Alaska.",
        "I came to office promising major ethics reform to end the culture of self-dealing, and today that ethics reform is the law.",
        "While I was at it, I got rid of a few things in the governor's office that I didn't believe our citizens should have to pay for.",
        "That luxury jet was over the top.",

        "But, she added, that's no excuse for doing nothing at all.",
        "Starting in January in a McCain/Palin administration, we're going to lay more pipelines and build more nuclear plants and create jobs with clean coal and move forward on solar, wind, geo-thermal and other alternative sources.",

        "We've all heard his dramatic speeches before devoted followers, and there is much to like and admire about our opponents.",
        "But listening to him speak, it's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or even a reform, not even in the state senate.",

        "But what's your take?",
        "This race appears to be a 30-30 race with everyone else trailing far behind; 30 percent for McCain; 27 percent for Romney, and Rudy Giuliani, believe it or not, barely clinging to a position in the teens at 13, ahead of Mike Huckabee at 11 percent.",

        "We know that in Florida hundreds of thousands of Republicans have already cast their ballots.",
        "They have a very liberal program for mailing in your ballot or voting early at certain designated places.",
