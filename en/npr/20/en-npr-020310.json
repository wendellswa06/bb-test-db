        "So I'm in Studio 3A, in Washington.",
        "Our guests will join us from the studios of KSTX in San Antonio, which is home to the Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston.",
        "Over the past 10 years, it's become an increasingly important center for military medicine.",
        "The specialties there include prosthetics - more on that later in the program - and burns, which can be among the most painful injuries and something very difficult to treat.",

        "How bad were your burns?",
        "Technical jargon, 18 percent total body surface area.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "It was six weeks later when I finally woke up.",
        "Whether that was from the narcotics or the traumatic brain injury is yet to be determined, but I still remember looking in the mirror for the first time, and my personality dictated what to do.",
        "And that was - my response was: I can live with that.",

        "Military operations in Marjah, for example, are ongoing, clearing out all the enemy fighters and the explosive devices they left behind will take months, McChrystal says.",
        "But he adds, doing things fast isnt the point.",
        "We couldve taken Marjah in the first night but the amount of damage and the number of casualties wouldve been much, much higher.",
        "And, in my view, that wouldve probably left us in a much worse position, maybe in a much, much worse position.",
        "Marjah has been billed as the biggest offensive since the war began back in 2001.",
        "And General McChrystal and Secretary Gates are already looking to it as a model for an even bigger fight: Kandahar.",
        "While Taliban fighters dont technically control the city, Kandahar is their spiritual home.",
        "At a briefing today at its headquarters here in Kabul, McChrystal said he expects to build up U.S.",

        "He wouldnt be specific about when the offensive might begin.",
        "He said unlike Marjah, the fight for Kandahar wont start with a sudden attack.",
        "So, there wont be a D-day that is climactic.",
        "It will be a rising tide of security as it comes.",
        "McChrystal and Gates hope is that Afghan security forces will increasingly take charge of that rising tide.",
        "Gates said as much today at a formal press conference in the palace of Afghan President Hamid Karzai.",
        "The room was packed and Gates message was phrased politely, but it was there all the same.",
        "Long-term success will ultimately be determined by how well the Afghan government, with the support of the international community, can respond to the citizens of Afghanistan and inspire their loyalty.",
        "Tomorrow, Gates plans to visit with troops outside Kabul.",
        "He says he wants to hear the ground truth about how they think the war effort is going.",
