        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "And I have to ask you, is the kind of attitude you heard from Sergeant Nelson, is that normal?",
        "For the most part, with our wounded warriors, many times.",
        "It's absolutely amazing how much the wounded warriors who've come through have inspired me to continue to do the work that I do, to continue to encourage other nurses to do the work that they do - to do everything we can to help these guys and gals endure the hardships of burn care and rehabilitation, to move on to their new normal.",
        "So, yeah, Todd actually is quite unique.",
        "He's an awesome, inspiring individual, but there's many folks like him.",
        "And the other thing I've known Todd to do is through his leadership, which are some of the skills he learned in the military, in helping to motivate other wounded warriors to drive on through their challenges secondary to their injuries, and to continue to try to look forward to their new life.",
        "So I think more so the norm than not.",
        "We want to hear from those who, men and women, who have suffered burns in the military, 800-989-8255.",
        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",
        "We want to hear your stories about your treatment and - well, how - your physical and mental scars.",
        "So please give us a call.",
        "But Lieutenant Colonel Serio-Melvin, I wonder, you talked about the difficulties of treatment.",
        "What's involved?",
        "Well, from a nursing perspective, a big part of what we do to care for these patients involves wound care and pain management.",
        "And we spend many, many hours with these patients, taking their dressings down, bringing them to the shower, cleaning their wounds, putting them in new dressings, and then helping get them back and forth to the operating room so that my colleague, Dr. Evan Renz, and his fellow burn surgeons can continue to do surgery on them.",
        "And then we will recover them from the anesthesia and continue to care for them post-operatively, doing everything we can to help their grafts heal and then continue to clean their wounds.",
        "We also spend a lot of time with the emotional support component.",
        "You know, the nurse is at the bedside from eight to 12 hours a day when he or she works.",
        "So we develop pretty close relationships with our patients and with their families.",
        "So sometimes, the first time that a person sees themselves in a mirror, it's when they're with the nurse.",
        "And you know, we're the person that they may confide in, or we may see tears because it's the first time that they've seen themselves, and that reality has kicked in after all that they've been through up to that point."

        "So I would say wound care, pain management, and a significant portion of that psychological, emotional support is a big, big part of what we do.",
        "And then from a critical care perspective, we're the eyes and the ears for the physicians as well.",
        "So we're monitoring these patients 24 hours a day, looking for any little, subtle signs and symptoms that something may be going right - or wrong, excuse me, and then letting the physicians know so that we can work together to help that patient out, to help them get better.",
        "And one of the main things that can go wrong is infection.",
        "And keeping the wounds clean, that has to be a never-ending task.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There are showers involved, hydrotherapy, I believe it's called?",
        "Yes, very much so.",
        "Sometimes we'll do what we call bed- bath, in the bed, especially in a critical care arena.",
        "But most times, as soon as we can possibly get them to the shower, they'll actually be put on a vertical shower cart, and we will bring them to a big shower room and put them in the shower, just as if you and I would take a shower.",
        "It's the same type of concept, except that the patient could be on the ventilator and be very ill, and they're on a monitor.",
        "So we make sure that their vital signs are OK, and we clean their wounds, and they're laying down at that same time.",
        "So we do that quite a bit.",
        "And that's been a very big key to our success in preventing burn wound infection.",
        "You also mentioned pain management.",
        "Burns can be excruciating.",
        "Doesn't that, doesn't water on them make it hurt even worse?",
        "Yes, it could, but you have to choose risk-benefit, as we say in the medical world.",
        "So if we don't clean their wounds and they get an infection, then they can die.",
        "So you have to bring them to the shower in order to clean those wounds.",
        "So what we try to do is give them an appropriate amount of medication to help the patient tolerate the pain, so they don't - and sometimes we can't make that pain go completely away, but we do all that we can through talking with them, providing that emotional support, and giving them the medications in order to help bring that pain down so they can at least tolerate the shower."

        "So some of the dressings that we use now were not available over a decade ago.",

        "So that's been a nice change in technology over time that's made a huge difference in burn care.",

        "And some of that at the beginning, then, is dealing with the extent of the injuries themselves?",
        "Most of our patients suffer from multiple injuries in addition to their burns because of the frequency that the extremities are injured.",
        "So it's not uncommon for a patient with severe burns from an explosion to also have - extremities to the lower extremities or their upper arms, etc.",
        "And the burns can be anywhere?",
        "Absolutely anywhere because the mechanism that we have seen since Iraq and Afghanistan started has involved, primarily, explosions.",
        "And therefore, we try, as a military, to provide good protection for the entire body.",

        "But if you can't, then how do you replace it?",
        "Well, that's one of the good news stories as far as advances in burn care over the last one or two decades, and that includes the ability to utilize materials such as biosynthetics or even cultured cells - which can be grown in the laboratory - to help close the wounds more rapidly, which until their development limited us to using either the patient's own skin, known as autograft, or we can use - temporarily, at least - cadaver skin or allograft.",
        "Allograft or - that's provided by people who donate their organs.",
