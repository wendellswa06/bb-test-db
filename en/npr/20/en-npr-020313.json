        "But he's doing fine, and he's back on active duty.",
        "But the staff and the surrounding community are tremendous.",
        "I was also able to go on a wounded warrior trip with my son, and the entire community turned out with parades and flags, and really did an awful lot to support these troops morally and emotionally.",
        "So thanks to the staff down there, and the community around Brooke Army Hospital - super people.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Kurt, and we wish your son the best of luck.",

        "All right.",
        "And Colonel Serio-Melvin, families play an important part in treatment, do they not?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "We spend a lot of energy supporting those family members because without a good support network, the success of that wounded warrior being able to accept their wounds and continue to move on through rehab and integrate into the community - if you don't have a strong family to help you with that, it makes that journey all the more difficult.",
        "And that first glimpse of somebody after they've come out of surgery from their family members, that's - you must have to prepare them for that sometimes."

        "They haven't seen them, many times, for months, sometimes almost a year, because their family member was deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF DRILL)",
        "They get that fearful phone call from whomever to let them know that their loved one was seriously injured, burned, and at the burn center in San Antonio.",
        "And the first time they come from the waiting room to walk into either the ICU or onto our acute care ward that we have, we spend a lot of time emotionally preparing them for what they are going to see.",
        "There's many instances of where you cannot recognize your loved one whatsoever, and they look very scary because of the extent of their injuries and the swelling that they will have as a consequences of the fluids they received to resuscitate them through the initial burn phase.",

        "And not feel too sorry for yourself.",
        "Yes, with a traumatic brain injury, unfortunately - or I guess fortunately - you cannot see the injury.",
        "So therefore, people look at you as though you should be normal, and you're not.",

        "It's very efficient.",
        "It's on 24 hours a day.",
        "And a provider deployed throughout the world can reach one of the consultant trauma surgeons pretty much instantly, to get either advice or just a comment about care.",
        "And oftentimes it's simply to coordinate the transfer of a patient back to one of the trauma centers.",
        "What's the most interesting question you've gotten by telemedicine?",
        "I can't really describe them as interesting.",
        "They - there are some that are more technically challenging, where oftentimes the provider who is asking the question has very good resources and that sometimes - the point where the question is beyond the capabilities..."

        "It made the biggest influence on my life.",

        "Colonel Serio-Melvin, I wonder: Does that sound like your first experience, too?",
        "Well, my first experience was a bit different because it was back in 1994, and we took care of mostly civilian emergencies back then; we didn't have a war going on.",
        "But I can tell you through my experience in 1994, when there was a big explosion at Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina - it's connected to Fort Bragg, North Carolina - and I took care of my first wounded warrior back then.",
        "And yes, absolutely, the esprit de corps among staff, the spirit - and again, the character, like what Todd had mentioned, of the individual soldiers who were burned is an experience you will not get anywhere else, in my personal opinion.",
