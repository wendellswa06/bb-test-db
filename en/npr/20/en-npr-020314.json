        "And everybody - from the person that shaved my leg for my first knee surgery, all the way to the recovery room - everybody treated me phenomenally, and I was really appreciative of it.",
        "And they do keep in touch with you about your follow-up.",
        "And I just can't commend or give as much, you know, praise to everybody that's in the medical field - enough, because of how they do treat everybody.",

        "Well, Neal, the construction has changed by leaps and bounds.",
        "The carbon fiber prosthetics, the components are significantly different than they were even 10 years ago.",
        "One point I'd like to bring up - I think is very important - is that it's - while we have substantial advances in technology, we've also made tremendous advances in the approach.",
        "And we use teams to do this.",
        "Those teams are - involve rehabilitative specialists.",
        "They're the trainers, the prosthetists who work side by side with the patients, so they're - really consider themselves clinicians, and more than technicians.",
        "They actually are able to make moment-by-moment changes in the fitting or the adjustment of these artificial limbs.",
        "And that really makes a difference for the patients as they adjust, and as they try to really achieve their greatest function.",
        "Well, somebody comes in and is going to need a prosthetic limb, how soon will the prosthetician start working with them?",
        "We do it as soon as we can get the injuries closed.",

        "Yes, sir.",

        "If some of these individuals have been laying in bed for - sometimes several weeks because of the very severe injuries, to get them out of bed takes energy.",
        "And so we start with, you know, with just transitions from the bed to crutches, even putting a socket on, to start with, before we have a foot that we attach to it.",
        "And these are, very often, very fit young men and women who are probably pretty eager to get back to what they were doing before.",
        "That's a great point, Neal.",
        "They have - they were, before their injury - and I think that's one of the points that makes it so inspiring to work with these young men and women because they, they - a few months or a few weeks or sometimes even a few days before we meet them, were in the peak of their health, in their young 20s.",
        "And now, they have a hard time adjusting to suddenly being in bed.",
        "And they're full of energy and full of passion to get that goal of being back up on their feet, or using their artificial hand again.",
        "And as you look at this, obviously, you don't want to get too far ahead of yourself.",
        "But on the other hand, young people can do amazing things."

        "And I'd like to - I think one of the points that she made that deserves highlighting is, it takes a lot of energy to use a prosthesis if you're an amputee.",
        "A lower-limb, below-the-knee amputation takes as much energy as it does to use crutches for us, for two-legged individuals.",
        "And so we really try to, when possible, salvage those limbs.",

        "Your husband has to work as hard and...",

        "And so, I mean, his legs are filled with stuff.",
        "And the - when he was younger, you know, you get something moving around and you get a little infection, and in a day or two it was gone, you know?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And now, you get little infection, and you might spend - he might sometimes has spent as long 12 weeks on PICC lines with really intensive antibiotics, and in wheelchairs.",
        "It's, you know, it's gotten pretty awful."
