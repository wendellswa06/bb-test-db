        "So that - those are kind of on the front of scientific advancement.",
        "It's - you know, it's something that happens as a result of necessity for these individuals.",
        "But you know, one of the points that we see with technology is that it's only applied as well as the people who not only create it, but place that on and train the individuals to use it, and then the individuals who give us, you know, inspiration because they're asking for more.",
        "Their goals are higher.",
        "Their expectations are to be normal.",

        "The idea that one's own brain can manipulate, well, prosthetic hands and prosthetic feet - is that all that far away?",
        "It's there now, for the hand.",
        "We - the normal electricity that makes your muscle work to close your hand is what our prosthetists use to control the fingers and thumb on a hand of a prosthesis.",
        "What we don't have yet is the ability to feel the - your foot or your fingers.",
        "And we're getting close to that.",
        "There are - some work around the country towards sensation, because that ability to feel is critical to - and really makes the critical difference between a prosthesis and your own hand or your own foot."

        "As we look ahead in some of the work that we're seeing right now, as we've said, the - if we're able to preserve a leg or a hand, that it doesn't hurt, that it can move, and it has that feeling that we don't yet have, we call that limb salvage or limb preservation.",
        "And in a young person, it's - they look for a life of increasing energy.",
        "And so I think that the most promising or the most hopeful development that we're seeing right now is the application of this high-technology socket prosthesis development towards using orthosis, or a limb salvage prosthesis, one that will give a stiff, painful foot the ability to run or to walk without having that pain every step.",
        "A dynamic brace is right around the corner.",
        "We're actually working with that now.",

        "Within the prosthesis, or the limb loss or the amputation area, one of the areas that we're most excited about is beginning to get that sensation back, or some more - called targeted muscle re-innervation, where the muscles can give feedback from the end of the prosthesis, and give sensation back.",
        "Of course, we all regret the terrible circumstances that caused this extensive practice and this extensive experience.",
