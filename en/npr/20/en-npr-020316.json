        "I knew there would be trouble.",
        "I was quite prepared to accept that.",
        "To me, it was more important that I recognize what I will call the Holy Spirit, and that I acted out of respect for that.",
        "And I would have more fear of disrespecting that than I would of causing difficulty for either myself or anyone else.",
        "I knew what to expect, and I knew what would happen, and I was perfectly willing to deal with the consequences.",
        "When you talk about the Holy Spirit, I mean, are you talking about the spirit of God, or the third part of the trinity?",
        "Ms.",
        "O'CONNOR: I get wary of the word God in a lot of ways because it can be misinterpreted.",
        "And also, I don't know that it's very descriptive.",

        "It's all the same spirit.",
        "But for me, the best way I can find to describe it is the Holy Spirit.",

        "Those involved in the cover-up have neither been fired nor prosecuted.",
        "It looks extremely bad that the pope hasn't fired them in outrage, for bringing him and the church into such disrepute.",
        "And lots of us in Ireland feel that we should be entitled to democratically elect who we think is fit to be pope, who we think is fit to run the Vatican.",
        "They need to come out of the 15th century into the 21st century, be transparent and responsible with it and hold to account, as any other organization is.",
        "There are these constant apologies for the abuse, but no acknowledgement or apology for the cover-up - and the present attempts to cover up the cover-up.",
        "So to me, the behavior of these people is as if they don't believe in God.",
        "They certainly don't seem to believe in a God that is watching them or what they're doing.",

        "O'CONNOR: Well, you know, a fantastic thing is and we in Ireland are very, very happy about this - is the fact that America has now joined the fight.",

        "You know, if you get something in America, it will do what it says on the tin, and I think that's how now the American people and the lawyers, etc., are really working very hard.",
