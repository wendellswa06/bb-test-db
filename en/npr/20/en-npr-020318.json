        "My obsolete skill is folding a nurse's cap.",
        "In the late 1950s, all nurses wore caps.",
        "Most of the caps had to be folded and each school's cap was unique.",
        "I attended Presbyterian Hospital's School of Nursing in Philadelphia.",
        "Six months after the start of our training, there was a capping service held in a church and filled with pomp and ceremony.",
        "From that day on, we were deemed to wear the cap.",
        "We were also responsible for folding the cap.",
        "The caps arrived from the hospital laundry clean and starch-stiff.",
        "Our cap arrived as a flat, stiff semicircle, and our job was to transform it to a three-dimensional hat.",
        "Ten straight pins with pearl ends were required for the job.",
        "The 10 pins represented the Ten Commandments.",
        "First, we folded the long flat side back on itself, then began folding 10 pleats, each one equidistant along the back of the cap.",
        "We stabbed fingers and refolded many caps before the skill was mastered.",
        "After graduation many of us stayed on to work at Presbyterian Hospital.",
        "We moved into shared apartments and quickly realized that the laundry no longer washed and starched our caps.",
        "We were on our own.",
        "An older nurse told us the best way to achieve the proper degree of stiffness was to wash the cap, dip it into starch and slap it onto the refrigerator door to drive.",
        "I cared for my caps this way for years.",
        "Caps eventually became passe.",
        "And mine lived for years in a dresser drawer until I was cast to play a nurse in a local community theater production.",
        "I washed and starched the cap, slapped it on to the refrigerator door, and when it was dry, I began to fold it.",
        "It took me three hours to accomplish the task that 30 years earlier had taken 15 minutes.",
        "During those three hours I realized that I missed the ritual of cap-folding and the young nurse who learned the skill.",
        "That is listener Fran Hill of Ephrata, Pennsylvania.",
        "She completed last week's homework assignment on obsolete skills.",
        "When we talked with her she gave us the idea for this week's assignment.",
        "She told us how nice the weather was in her part of Pennsylvania this month.",
        "And that got us to wondering, of course, whether March indeed still comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb.",
        "And that got us wondering about the fate of many of the other great old weather proverbs.",
        "And so for this week, we're asking you to update your favorites.",
        "Some may need a rethink because of climate change.",
        "This well, maybe they just got old.",
        "Send your new weather proverbs to homework@npr.org or call the Homework hotline; it's 202-408-5183 - 202-408-5183.",

        "Today what you can buy in one Florida county.",
        "Property values are soaring in the Sunshine State and that has developers racing to build more homes.",
        "NPR's Scott Horsley reports on what the Census Bureau called the nation's fastest-growing county.",
        "SCOTT HORSLEY reporting:",
        "The first thing you see when you visit the Flagler County, Florida, Web site is a guide to avoiding shark attacks.",
        "That's followed by a news release on the arrival of a mosquito-borne illness.",
        "But neither sharks nor bloodsucking insects have stopped families from flocking to the coastal county, between Daytona Beach and St. Augustine.",
        "From mid-2003 to 2004, Flagler County added homes at a 14 percent clip, nearly 10 times the pace of the rest of the country.",
        "County spokesman Carl Laundrie says there have been some growing pains in the area, which was originally planned as a retirement community.",
        "What happened was Grandma and Grandpa came here and then pretty soon the sons and daughters came with their family and schools are faced with building pretty much a school a year for the next 10 years to keep up with the growth."

        "This is unusual.",
        "President Trump's imprint on the federal bench will be felt for decades even after he leaves office.",
        "And that's by design.",
        "White House counsel Don McGahn, who's leaving his job soon, worked very closely with Senate Republicans to confirm Trump's judges - so closely that this week, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley basically tweeted, say it ain't so when he heard McGahn was leaving.",
        "And Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called McGahn the most impressive White House counsel he'd ever observed during his time in Washington.",
        "That's almost all due to the number of judges that McGahn has ushered through - as of this week, 26 federal appeals court judges, a record for this stage in a presidency, and more than 30 lower court judges.",
        "Plus, importantly, one Supreme Court justice, Neil Gorsuch, and another possibly on the way, Brett Kavanaugh.",
        "So, Carrie, the fact that there were that many vacancies - that's not an accident.",
        "Not an accident at all - in fact, a strategy by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell from Kentucky, a guy who wanted to keep those seats open for the next president, whom he hoped would be Republican.",
        "That strategy worked.",
        "McConnell, of course, didn't even have a hearing on President Obama's Supreme Court pick Merrick Garland and kept a number of other seats from being filled, so President Trump had an unusually high number of vacancies when he walked in the door of the White House.",
        "So let's talk about the kinds of people that the president has been choosing to serve on the federal courts.",
        "Tell us about them.",
        "Who are they?",
        "They're mostly white and male, far less diverse than President Obama's choices.",
        "In the last several months, though, Trump has identified more women, more Asian-Americans - overall, very few African-American and Latino judges.",
        "And these Trump judges are young - late 30s, early 40s, by and large.",
        "One candidate in his mid-50s told me he was considered to be too old to even apply for the job.",
        "These Trump picks are also very conservative.",
        "I recently took a look at a new judge named Jim Ho.",
        "He's not a household name, but he's already making a lot of waves on the U.S.",
        "Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.",
        "In his very short time in the bench, Ho's gone out of his way to stick his finger in the eye of liberals with opinions on abortion and gun rights and campaign finance.",
        "Many of these picks by Donald Trump have been previously vetted by elite conservative groups like the Federalist Society, the Heritage Foundation and the Susan B.",
        "Anthony List, which aims to limit abortion rights.",
        "One other goal, Michel, of the Trump administration is to usher in an era of deregulation - to crack down on what they call the administrative state - so these judges are largely pro-business types, too.",
        "I think people who have followed this have noted that a number of these nominees have been rated as unqualified by the American Bar Association.",
        "What's happening there?",
