        "I mean we can just go back to 1992, for example.",
        "And since that election - which was George H.W.",
        "Bush versus Bill Clinton - no candidate who wasn't a sitting president heading off to summits and things like that has, in the year of the election, traveled overseas.",
        "So what we're seeing is extremely unusual - unusual that it's happening at all, let alone how much of it we're seeing.",
        "Well, Barack Obama confirmed a trip to Iraq and Afghanistan this weekend.",
        "And that came after he was taunted by John McCain for not going to Iraq in a long time.",

        "Senator JOHN McCAIN (Republican, Arizona; Republican Presidential Candidate): I certainly was just a short time ago glad to hear that Senator Obama is now, quote, \"\"considering a trip to Iraq.\"\" It's long overdue.",

        "What do you think, Don?",
        "Did John McCain force Barack Obama to plan a trip to Iraq?",
        "The challenge was laid down.",
        "The Obama campaign would never acknowledge that their hand was forced here.",
        "And if we can update John McCain, he said it had been 871 days, well…",
        "Back in May, that was.",
        "…actually, it's now been 905 days.",
        "We know that because GOP.com has a handy little counter ticking off the days, hours, minutes and seconds.",
        "Well, what are the perceived benefits of all this travel abroad?",
        "First for Obama, what would he stand to gain by going overseas?",
        "Simply put: stature.",
        "The one thing that McCain campaign tries to hang on Barack Obama is that he just does not have the kind of experience - not only that John McCain has, but that an American president should have, that he had time in the Illinois State Senate, that he's had less than a full term in the United States Senate, that he just doesn't have the experience."

        "Those pictures can all be very helpful to him.",

        "You don't want to make a slip or a mistake and perhaps reveal that you don't have, you know, the experience, playing into the McCain campaign's hands.",
        "So he does have to be careful.",
        "The other thing about Senator Obama, he is adored overseas.",
        "And he has to be careful not to have that adulation be too great, lest it send a signal to Middle America that, hey, this is the guy that Europe wants - not necessarily a good thing.",
        "Now John McCain's trip to Colombia - what does he stand to gain by going there?",
        "And what can he say and what can't he say to his hosts when he's there as a candidate?",
        "He can't make policy, but he can talk about how important the issues are, and they are talking about trade.",
        "It gives him a chance to highlight the differences between himself and Senator Obama on the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, which Senator Obama opposes.",
        "Senator McCain is for it.",
        "They're also talking about immigration and drug trafficking and things like that.",

        "She told me that she really hopes that the school increases the number of armed police - public safety officers, rather - and also that they install metal detectors to prevent firearms from being carried into the school again.",
        "You know, after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., in February there were a lot of calls for more gun control from students.",

        "Oh, these are certainly not final positions, but there's a lot of jockeying to come.",

        "I think it was also totally predictable.",
        "I don't think that there's much opportunity right now for any real negotiations or any real progress on any side.",
        "I think the president is to be commended for - he recognizes how important this is that what we've got right now is simply unsustainable.",

        "I wonder with your fine eye what you noticed in the speech that may have escaped the rest of us.",

        "And that's where I think the Israel part fits in, which is to say that I think many people have grown very comfortable with the status quo, which is unpleasant but basically seen to be relatively stable.",
        "And what he was trying to say is that we've looked around the entire region and what looks like it's stable actually isn't.",

        "Did he catch the wave of history, if you please, with that speech, because there was criticism in the region that he certainly didn't say much about Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.",
        "Well, he did talk about Bahrain, and I think that that pleased many activists who didn't expect him to say that.",
        "But you're right, he didn't talk about Saudi Arabia.",
        "And many people noticed, for example, that he had a long stretch of discussion on women in the region but didn't mention Saudi Arabia, which is quite glaring.",
        "I actually think that if he had given this speech when they originally wanted to give it, shortly after the fall of President Mubarak and before things turned bloody in Syria, in Libya, in Yemen, in Bahrain, then I think you would have had more of that feel of catching the wave of history.",
        "The feel that it had now was of catching your breath and trying to make sense of what's been happening in this, you know, this crazy rush of events and trying to make sense, both for themselves and for the world and for the American people of what we're doing, why we're doing it and I think crucially why it matters to the American people.",
        "And I think it goes back to this notion of the United States has real interest in the region.",
        "It has real values at stake and this wasn't a choice that Obama made to throw the region into unrest.",
