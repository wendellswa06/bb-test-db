        "Obviously, the more sophisticated longer range ones many fewer than the Katyushas.",
        "Well, over the years they've stockpiled an enormous number of these things.",
        "As you said, most of them are the short range, with a range of less than ten miles.",
        "But it's reported that they have hundreds that would be able to reach a few dozen miles, possible dozens that would be able to reach a range even further than that.",
        "Even though the number of rockets that they've fired over the last few days is really unprecedented - it's just outside of our experience base - it only represents three percent of their reported stockpile.",
        "So you have to be concerned that we're much closer to the beginning of this thing than we are to the end of it.",
        "And very quickly, if you look at the range of these weapons down the road, if you're talking about operational security, how far back Israel might want to push various forces...",
        "It's going to be very difficult for them to get security against these longer range missiles simply by pushing Hezbollah a few miles away from the border the way they did back in the '90s.",

        "He was greeted by outgoing president Francois Hollande.",
        "The two shook hands warmly before disappearing together in a handover tete a tete where such secrets as the country's nuclear codes are passed from old president to new.",

        "He has taken the country by storm.",
        "Brand new to politics, Macron had no party apparatus behind him, but it didn't seem to matter.",

        "So in his inaugural address, Donald Trump spoke about American carnage in a speech that really took a lot of people aback for its deeply negative tone on an occasion that usually calls for the opposite.",
        "So what do you make of this talk of the American spirit now?",
        "I'm not sure what to make of it.",
        "You know, Sean Spicer, the press secretary, said in addition to laying out his vision, Trump will also talk about what he's accomplished already.",
        "That I understand because Trump routinely says he's done more than any other president in American history.",
        "But Trump's aides told us before the inaugural speech that it was going to be about unity, but it turned out it wasn't at all.",
        "It was very dark and dystopian, as you said.",
        "It sounded like the blow torch was being passed to a new generation, as some journalists quipped.",
        "So I don't know when they preview a kind of more optimistic Sunday speech if it's going to turn out to be exactly that.",
        "Well, if they are saying or if they're suggesting that the address will be optimistic, does this indicate an acknowledgement that the tone of the inaugural address, perhaps, did not strike the right tone, that perhaps the president needs to strike a more positive or optimistic tone?",
        "There are definitely people who think that he needs to do that.",
        "His approval rating is very low, and they believe, especially Republicans in Congress, that if he's going to ask members of Congress to cast tough votes, it's going to be harder and harder if his approval rating continues to be low."

        "So that's the rationale to be more positive and more inclusive because so far, Trump has mostly spoken to his base - might have succeeded in getting his base to be even more loyal and enthusiastic about him, but there's no doubt he has shrunk his support.",
        "He won with 46 percent and now he's hovering anywhere from 38 to 42.",
        "And that's historically low, by the way.",
        "No president has ever dropped during their first month or gotten this low.",
        "So tell us - remind us if you would about what the purposes of a speech like this - it is tradition.",
        "It is tradition, and traditionally the president comes new - brand new president to give policy direction to Congress, to tell his members of Congress, Republican members what he wants them to do as they try to craft tax reform and health care reform.",
        "And the problem is that Republicans have put themselves inside a kind of a Rubik's cube because they have to repeal Obamacare first in order to get the money to pay for those huge tax cuts.",
        "They could make Medicaid less generous to get some money for tax cuts or they could scrap subsidies.",
        "The problem is that Donald Trump hasn't provided them with a lot of guidance about what he wants for Obamacare beyond what the White House said this morning which is that the goal is that no one loses coverage.",
        "The problem is that Obamacare is getting more popular by the day, and Republicans still haven't figured out if they repeal it what do they want to replace it with.",
        "Well, aside from health care, you've also mentioned the other big priority is tax reform.",
        "We've heard House Speaker Paul Ryan and the president have been actually split on their approaches.",
        "So where does that sit?",
        "Well, the big split was about something called a border adjustment tax, basically a tax on imports not exports.",
        "That's something that House Republicans want.",
        "In the past, the president has described the border adjustment tax as being too complicated.",
        "But last week for the first time, he said in a Reuters interview it could lead to a lot more jobs in the U.S.",
        "And Paul Ryan took that as a quasi-endorsement.",
        "And the reason why this is important for Republicans is the border adjustment tax generates a lot of money.",
        "And that could help pay for tax cuts, but it splits the Republican's business coalition because businesses that import goods don't like it at all, like retailers.",
        "Businesses that export like it, and the other big question that I'm looking for Donald Trump to answer on Tuesday night is does he just want tax cuts or does he want tax reform?",
        "Tax reform is where you lower rates, but you also get rid of a lot of deductions, so rich people, for instance, end up paying pretty much the same even though they're paying a lower rate.",
        "And we don't know if Donald Trump is a tax cutter or a tax reformer.",
        "Before we let you go, Mara, we have to ask about how we think Democrats are going to respond to this event Tuesday night.",
        "I think they're going to be quiet and sullen, and they're going to be bringing a lot of guests who represent groups they believe the president threatens.",
        "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says she's going to bring a dreamer, the mother of a victim of gun violence and someone she says is going to be a symbol of freedom of the press.",
        "There's also going to be a Democratic response to the speech which is interesting.",
        "Two people are going to respond - the first former Kentucky governor Steven Beshear.",
        "Kentucky is a place where there are a lot of those white working-class voters, a lot of coal miners.",
        "And Kentucky has a very popular Obamacare program called Kynect.",
        "And the second Democratic response is going to be delivered in Spanish from Astrid Silva who is a dreamer and an immigrant's rights advocate.",
        "So you've got that contrast teed up pretty clearly."
