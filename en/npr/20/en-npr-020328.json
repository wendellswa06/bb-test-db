        "On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators will release their long awaited justice proposal.",
        "Sources tell NPR the plan will include a pathway for well-behaved inmates to earn credit to leave prison early, an idea favored by leading Republicans and a way that gives judges more discretion to lower the sentences of new criminal offenders, an approach supported by several Democrats.",
        "The Obama Justice Department has been pushing that idea in part because paying for federal prisons now eats up about a third of the budget.",
        "Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates...",
        "These costs are swallowing up funds that would otherwise be available for state and local law enforcement, for victims of crime and for prevention and reentry programs.",
        "How much money the new plan could save and how many prisoners the changes will touch are still unclear, as is the fate of the legislation in a Congress about to be consumed by the presidential election.",

        "As of yesterday, Bitcoins could be used to purchase merchandise sold in the team shop at the Sleep Train Arena.",
        "Fans will be able to make online purchases, including game tickets, with Bitcoins by March 1st.",
        "Americans settled Western Colorado one canyon at a time.",
        "Rivers and streams were the original highways.",
        "Roads, when they came, followed rivers, often on narrow shelves of rock at the foot of canyon walls.",
        "And when floods hit Colorado, many roads washed away.",
        "In recent days, Colorado resident Mark Benjamin has helped to build a zip line to get supplies to neighbors cut off by flooding.",
        "I got 250 feet of cable 30 years ago I've been dragging around with me.",
        "And we took her down to the river, and we tied a rock to a rope and threw it across the creek, and my son caught it.",
        "And then we dragged the zip line across, and put it up in some trees.",
        "If we could get it higher, the sag would still allow a person to go across without dragging their butt in the water.",
        "Mark Benjamin lives in Bellevue, Colorado.",
        "Drought and forest fires swept through the area a few years ago, thinning out the vegetation, which made it harder for the earth to absorb the rains.",
        "We called to ask about the flood damage to nearby roads and what it will take to repair them."

        "Starting about a quarter-mile down from our driveway, there's four major breeches where the creek crossed the road.",

        "The road is gone on the curves.",
        "I want to make it clear: When you say the road is gone in places where the river and the road curve, you don't mean the road is underwater.",

        "Again, as was already said, if he wasn't fit for Ways and Means, then what is the difference with this committee?",
        "So I think he certainly can do the people's business, but I don't think it makes much sense to put your neck out on the line and put the Democrats' neck on the line for somebody at this point that we don't know whether the are clean or dirty.",
        "And on top of that, I'm a little concerned why this investigation, either they have something or they don't.",
        "I think at some point, too, they need to decide what they're going to do with Jefferson.",
        "I don't think it is fair to him or his constituents to let this thing drag on for the long term without some type with determination.",
        "If they're going to indict him, indict him and let's move forward with that so he can have the opportunity to answer the charges.",
        "But if they don't have enough, they need to, you know, deal with that and resolve it in some way that his name is, at least for the time being, somewhat clear so he can move forward."

        "I mean the presidential kit, well not necessarily national politics, but local politics.",
        "I suspect, Tony, that the delay is because maybe Congressman Jefferson is going to find a way to say that he'll, you know, maybe he will come forward in just suggest that perhaps he'll defer this appointment until this is resolved on behalf of the people of Louisiana.",
        "You know, the interesting about this is that the Louisiana, the House of Representatives are planning on voting present.",

        "Louisiana is tending toward Republican for the first time in a long time.",
        "And so the Republicans may be thinking more along those lines as opposed to whether or not they're really concerned about Jefferson's ethical behavior.",

        "Now we are finding that that information might have been embellished just a little bit.",
        "Research showing that black men living under those guiles and claiming to be straight while having sex with men in secret did, in fact, not increase the spread of HIV.",
        "So Yvonne, how important is this revelation?",
        "I think it's very important from the standpoint that it seems that when we deal with black Americans that we take a kernel of information, and rather than look and be clear about getting accurate facts, that we just run with assumptions."

        "Joe Davidson's answer was to my question as to whether or not he thought, and I'll put the same question to you, that we in the black press tended to - and that including this show on NPR, which obviously is not the black press - but whether or not we were irresponsible in going with this story in the way that we did initially.",
