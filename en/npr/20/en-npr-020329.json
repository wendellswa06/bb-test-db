        "I'll come back to you, Joe, since you got cut off before.",
        "What's the greater good in a situation like this, because the court has to decide if the police acted properly or improperly?",
        "You know, many police departments around the country have decided that the greater good is the safety of the public, and therefore a number of police departments have curtailed high-speed chases.",
        "Because high-speed chases often result in injury, or injury to the public, property damage when these cars crash.",
        "And not because a police car has rammed the getaway car, but simply because when you're driving around the streets at a very high speed, you're much more likely to have an accident.",
        "So I found it surprising, frankly, that some police departments allow a police car to ram the getaway car.",
