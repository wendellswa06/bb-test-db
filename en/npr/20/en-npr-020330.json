        "That's exactly right, and there could be you know, as much recrimination and bad feelings that we saw in the waning days of the campaign, you're going to probably see the lame duck because Republicans are going to say, well, wait a second.",
        "We cleaned up on November 2nd, and here we have Democrats in charge in the lame duck.",
        "So it'll be - it probably will be a lot of acrimony.",
        "Well, let's bring some an analyst in on the conversation.",

        "I think we can.",
        "I think Republicans did very, very well, better than many people expected.",
        "They didn't quite win the Senate, but I think their numbers have increased enough that they're going to be able to stop the Democrats from some of the mischief that they've been up to over the last two years, which the voters didn't agree with.",
        "And one of those things of mischief, as you would describe it, I'm sure, is denying the extension of the tax cuts to those making over $250,000 a year.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "I think you will see a broad-base tax cut - at least an extension, maybe it will be one year, maybe it'll be longer - of the Bush tax cuts.",
        "I think most economists believe that you don't raise taxes, even on the rich, during a recession.",
        "And so I think you're likely to see that come through - if not in the lame duck, it will certainly come through as an item of business early in the new session.",
        "Keli Goff is a political analyst and author, a contributor to TheLoop21.com, and she's with us here in Studio 3A.",
        "Nice to have you back on the program.",
        "Great to be back.",

        "Right.",
        "Is any of this going to be moving ahead?",

        "But, of course, we know that the House is incredibly important when it comes to actually getting things through.",
        "So that's a very long-winded way to say that I hate to break it to progressives, but I don't think that the next two years are going to be looking a lot better than the last two years.",
        "So if you weren't happy with those, good news, the sequel's worse.",
        "You know, I will quote Bill Cosby here, though.",
        "He once said that if you're making everyone happy, you're doing something wrong.",
        "So the good news for the president is he must be doing a lot of stuff right, because progressives are unhappy, conservatives are unhappy, and apparently, according to yesterday, independents aren't so happy, either.",
        "So I guess in terms of his legacy in getting stuff done, he's, you know, doing something right in that light.",
        "We saw a fascinating poll published in the New York Times, just at the end of the campaign, about the Obama coalition.",
        "And among those who came out very strongly, of course, to support him last time around, Hispanics from - African-Americans and, of course, young people.",
        "And from what we're gathering so far in terms of what it looked like, Latinos did come out and vote yesterday.",
        "Young people, not so much.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "You know, I've read about this group quite a bit.",
        "And so here's what's fascinating.",
        "I like to say that the Democrats had two major, major problems yesterday.",
        "Major problem number one was a candidate whose name wasn't even on the ballot, and that's Barack Obama, because there are a lot of voters who, to put it diplomatically, just are not fans of the president right now.",
        "And we're talking particularly older voters, older white voters, and they vote.",
        "They're not like young people who vote sometimes and not others.",
        "The second biggest problem the Democrats faced is the fact that Barack Obama's name wasn't on the ballot, and that's because there are a lot of voters part of the Democratic base, younger voters and voters of color, who are extremely loyal to President Obama, but his name wasn't on the ballot.",
        "And it's really hard to be a Democrat in a conservative district who looks at a black voter and says, come on, a vote for me is a vote for the president's agenda, when you're then turning around and criticizing the president's agenda to try to win older, white voters.",
        "And I think that's what ultimately proved to be a problem with those two groups, black voters and younger voters."

        "Neal, I'd just like to say that there is a little bit of a cloud hanging over the Republican victory last night - and it's one you won't hear about from a lot of Republican analysts - and that has to do with Latino voters.",
        "It was a very interesting night last evening.",
        "You had a huge victory for Republican Latino candidates, two governorships and a Senate seat won by Republican Hispanics.",
        "On the other hand, Hispanics may very well have been the decisive vote that deprived the Republicans of defeating Harry Reid.",
        "You had Sharron Angle, who decided to get off-message, not to talk about the expansion of government, not to talk about things like health care, but to start anti-immigrant bashing.",
        "And frankly, she got less - 60,000 votes less than Brian Sandoval, the Republican candidate for governor.",
        "And so that may have actually been as a result of Hispanic turnout.",
        "And I think you could also point to the loss of the Senate seat in the state of Colorado as perhaps owing to the fact that you had a very large anti-Republican vote among Hispanics because of Tom Tancredo's presence on the gubernatorial race.",
        "And that may actually have, again, sort of ironically hurt Ken Buck, who was running for Senate.",
        "But Linda, you also saw in Arizona, for example, Jan Brewer, who signed the controversial anti-immigrant law, won overwhelming re-election - actually, election, because this is the first time she's run.",
        "And we saw two Democrat incumbents in Arizona get knocked out - Ann Kirkpatrick and Harry Mitchell - also because of the immigration issue.",
        "Well, I think that's right, but I think that Arizona is a sort of a special case.",
        "I mean, it is the frontlines in the immigration wars.",
        "I think Republicans ought to consider seriously whether or not they ought to sort of get ahead of the wave and perhaps consider supporting legal immigration reform.",
        "We're talking today about the results and what they mean going forward for Republicans and Democrats in Congress and for the White House.",
        "What change do you expect as a result of yesterday's elections?",
        "I think the difficult issue is what do about the 12 million or so illegal immigrants who are here.",
        "But frankly, I think the country as a whole is very much in favor of moving forward with changes in legal immigration laws that would make it easier to allow people to come here legally to work.",
        "And I think the Republicans, if they want to be the majority party for the future, they're going to have to figure out a way to win larger numbers of Hispanic votes."
