        "All right, Keli Goff, do you think the president is going to move to the center?",
        "I actually hope that the White House is listening, because I think that and the new heads of Congress, because I think that that caller just encapsulates exactly what a lot of voters feel, the frustration on both sides.",
        "And so I think it's incredibly important that we not have what happened back in '95, in which we ended up having a government shutdown because both sides didn't want to work together.",
        "And I think that's the cautionary tale for the White House.",
        "The last thing I say is I wrote a piece criticizing - saying that it's actually better for Obama to possibly lose one of the houses because it would push him to the center like Clinton did, which got Clinton re-elected.",
        "And Linda Chavez, are Republicans going to be willing to work with him if he does move?",
        "I think Republicans do not want to have a government shutdown.",
        "I think that was a bit of overreaching back in the mid-'90s, and I think it did not help Republicans.",
        "So I think they do want to get some things done.",
        "It's just a different set of things that they're going to want to get done than the Obama administration.",
        "What is not clear to me, though, Neal, is whether or not Barack Obama really is Bill Clinton.",
        "Bill Clinton, after all, was part of the Democratic Leadership Council.",
        "He was a much more centrist, much more moderate Democrat.",
        "I think Barack Obama is, in fact, a committed progressive.",
        "He is about trying to change this nation, moving it more to be much more similar to some of the social democracies in Western Europe, and I think he's quite ideological.",
        "So it's not clear to me that he is going to be able to bring himself to do what Bill Clinton did, and only time will tell."

        "It's going to be difficult, having said that, to when you face something like the debt limit.",
        "I mean, we're spending - we're borrowing 41 cents on the dollar right now.",
        "To be able to eliminate that in one year, or in the next few months before we have to raise the debt ceiling, is probably not going to be possible.",
        "So we're going to be faced with a dilemma here: How do we convince people that we're serious about moving ahead on spending when we haven't been too good in the past?",

        "You never you didn't like the kind of establishment, the way the Republican leadership did their thing.",
        "And that's one of the reasons Republicans were defeated in 2006 and 2008.",

        "And so I think I'm curious as to what your panel thinks about what's going to happen in Texas, and Texas tends to be sort of a bellwether for the nation.",
        "When things start to change in Texas, they start to change elsewhere.",
        "How do we deal with, you know, a huge budget deficit without working with the federal government - our leadership has said they'll take no federal funds and maintain jobs and employment without social services and education in Texas?",

        "Well, yes, that's true.",
        "But, I mean, as gubernatorial candidate White, the former mayor of Dallas, tried to Houston - tried to make the case that Rick Perry overstayed his welcome, that there are problems that the Republicans and the Republican leadership are ignoring, Rick Perry being governor longer than anybody else in history, it was a referendum on the Republican rule.",
        "And yet according to the numbers, people in Texas were pretty happy with what they had."
