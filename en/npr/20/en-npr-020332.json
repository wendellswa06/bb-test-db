        "And Jeff Flake, let me put this to you, as well: One of the things the Obama administration did in its second - if you want to describe it that way, they wouldn't - stimulus package was to send money to the states to hire teachers and policemen and firemen and that sort of thing.",
        "Is that going to be possible in this next part of Congress?",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "I think that's well, first, coming from Arizona, I think we'd gladly trade places with Texas right now in terms of our own budget problems.",

        "What hopefully the states can look for is some relief on future expenses.",
        "And if the health care bill was implemented as planned, I can tell you that will put states like Arizona, Texas - you name it, just about every state - in deficit to the tune of, in Arizona's case, more than a billion dollars a year in addition to everything that's going on.",
        "So I think the best states can hope for is some kind of relief from future expenses.",
        "The speaker-to-be, John Boehner, called health care a monstrosity, said it needs to be repealed and replaced.",
        "The president said: Let's not spend the next two years fighting over the legislative acts of the last two years.",
        "Is health care reform going to be as much a part of the next two years as it was the last two years?",
        "I think it has to be.",
        "You can put all the questions about, you know, individual mandates and whatever else at the federal level or the individual level aside and just realize that at the state level, we simply can't afford this.",
        "The maintenance-of-effort requirements, the matching funds that'll have to be provided will put already strapped state legislatures over the brink.",
        "And so it would be all well and good to put those discussions aside, but we can't - fiscally, we simply can't.",
        "Congressman Flake, thanks very much for your time today.",

        "As you look ahead, though, one of the mandates, if you will, that seemed to come across yesterday at certainly some of Tea Party candidates was for clean amendment, for no more earmarks, plenty of time for members to read legislation before they vote.",
        "The rules committee obviously plays a large part in all of those things.",
        "Rep: DREIER: Those are all priorities that I have, Neal.",

        "We've gone through this entire Congress without a single bill in the House of Representatives being considered under an open amendment process.",
        "And that meant that Democrats and Republicans, alike, have been denied the opportunity to participate."

        "And certainly, I mean if we have open rule, we will have had more than we've had in this past Congress.",
        "But, you know, we want to move ahead and we want to make sure that there is, in fact, an opportunity for members to read the bill, as you said, Neal, so there's an opportunity for us to have the kind of free flowing debate that the American people deserve, rather than having this process closed down.",
        "We're talking with Congressman David Dreier, who represents the 20 - is it the 26th District of California?",
