        "So when a refinery needs a pollution permit to operate, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality pays attention.",
        "In fact, says Assistant Secretary Chuck Carr Brown, the state has developed new rules that allow refineries and others to expedite permits - for a fee.",

        "They are so high that if they put out what they were permitted to put out, you couldn't breathe in the area.",
        "So these levels are fiction.",
        "Though Ford and his activist neighbors have won legal battles against Exxon Mobil in the last year, the plant's now operating as permitted under federal law.",
        "Air is difficult to test and so it's hard to know when a refinery's actually polluting.",
        "And even though Louisiana has 44 monitoring sites, pinpointing the source of pollutants and the levels people are exposed to is tricky.",
        "And permits are complicated because refineries are complicated with dozens of values, stacks and gas-emitting parts.",
        "The intricate paperwork can run hundreds of pages and so compliance is time consuming."

        "They might encourage people actually under some of our old rules to not go forward with things that would have reduced their emissions.",
        "And so I do think that what we've been trying to do has improved the program and yet at the same time to still be sure that we're getting the environmental benefit out of the program.",

        "As we know, it was a zigzag week on Wall Street, at times reminiscent of the financial crisis of late 2008.",
        "Yesterday, the U.S.",
        "stock market closed on a high note, despite days of record-setting swings caused by investor concerns about the global economy.",
        "Coming up, we'll hear about the economic troubles across parts of Europe.",

        "markets.",
        "He's a senior writer for Bloomberg Business Week, and he joins us from New York.",
        "Welcome to the program, Roben.",

        "What didn't happen, I mean, short of Godzilla marching up and down Wall Street?",
        "I mean, this was a period coming off of that rather blindsiding downgrade of the U.S.'s credit rating on Friday, and people didn't want to make of it come Monday.",
        "They had a long weekend to stew over it.",
        "And then you suddenly have things coming unhinged in Europe, rumors back and forth, and before you know it, the Dow is down 7 percent on Monday and it feels like 2008 all over again.",
        "But the Dow then snaps back 5 percent on Tuesday, plunges again on Wednesday and ends the week, I think, down one-and-a-half percent.",
        "So, really people don't know what to make of it.",
        "It's almost a battle for the soul of the market.",
        "Yeah, Godzilla or maybe Spiderman should show up, because yesterday a report showed that U.S.",
        "consumer confidence is at its lowest point in three decades, and yet investors seem to dismiss this.",
        "Why was that?",
        "Because there is really a bifurcation between what's going on in corporate America right now with record cash on balance sheets and consumer sentiment, which, of course, we know is in the dumps because unemployment is horrific.",
        "There's still these lingering after-effects of the financial crisis and credit is still tight to get.",
        "And yet companies out there, especially multinational companies, just are sitting on a record cash hoard.",
        "So, it's very binary; it's either you sell on the news or you buy on the news.",
        "Certainly, it's becoming extremely difficult, prohibitively difficult, to sit on cash.",
        "The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates down near zero since December of 2008 and came out this week and telegraphed that we're probably going to have pretty much more of the same for the next two years.",
        "So what are you going to do?",
        "So, do you think that the swings are going to continue or do you think it might settle down a bit?",
        "I think the swings are going to continue.",
        "I think we're very much beholden to headlines, headlines coming out.",

        "Yesterday, it was retail sales.",
        "I mean, figure that out.",
        "I don't get it.",
        "But then there's this other news that reminds us that we're still in the later innings of the financial crisis.",
        "If institutions were failing in the United States in 2008 and 2009, now we're at the risk of entire countries defaulting on their debt, and so we don't know how that's going to ripple across the pond and affect us.",

        "Congressman Davis spoke with NPR's Farai Chideya before the House voted.",
        "He explained why he was willing to put his political clout on the line to keep Hope VI alive.",
        "Well, Hope VI has been an enormously important program for renovating inner-city communities and for bringing vitality and health back to a lot of those communities over the last 15 or 16 years.",
        "It was initially a bipartisan project.",
        "It was started under Bush 41.",

        "And the last two years the president was unsuccessful.",
        "The president proposed no new money for Hope VI.",
        "Congress restored funding the last two years.",
        "This year, the president, for the third time, has tried to do away with Hope VI, and the Transportation, Treasury and Housing Appropriations bill does not contain any provision for Hope VI.",
        "That's a big disappointment to those of us who care about economic development in the inner city and that's why we played a major role in leading this fight.",
        "My district alone has three Hope VI projects that we've gotten in the last six years.",

        "The people who live there are given the first opportunity to stay.",
        "But they're physically renovated so they look like more conventional, modern town homes, which draws young professionals, which draws families back into the community, and which also creates a basis for businesses to relocate near the area.",
        "So what you get from a Hope VI project is an area that's often been blighted and neglected is physically transformed into a vibrant center of city life.",
        "We think it's important to get Hope VI funded at some level so that we keep the program going and that we get additional projects in the pipeline.",
        "Let's turn a little bit to some of your background and history.",
        "You grew up in a family where you didn't have a ton of money, ended up going to Harvard, going into private practice, and then, when you were elected, you beat out a fairly traditional, old-school African-American Democrat, the first Democratic African-American representative since Reconstruction.",

        "Oh, I don't think that we burned any bridges with the voters in our district.",

        "The district is still in very strong Democratic hands, and I think the district has a representative in myself who's committed to issues at the core of the Democratic Party: lifting up the conditions of people who've been left behind; giving people help when they need it; giving them a fair shot at opportunity in this society.",

        "Well, make no mistake, it's been a very, very difficult task for those of us who have a certain set of values for America to prevail in the last couple sessions of Congress.",
        "The Republican majority in Congress has a very different vision of America, and Hope VI is a good example of that.",

        "We managed to get Congress to expand the child tax credit for working-class families.",
        "So I'm a very strong believer that if you find some issues that you can press, and you can challenge Republicans on their own rhetoric, if you can challenge them to make their votes and their rhetoric catch up, you can make a difference every now and then.",
        "But, obviously, this has been a long and difficult fight for Democrats.",
        "Let's talk a little bit more about the Democratic Party.",
        "You are often grouped with a new generation of African-American leadership, including Harold Ford and Barack Obama, that try to promote a big-tent theory of how the Democrats should reach out to America as opposed to perhaps a more traditionally partisan one.",
        "Do you agree with that assessment, and is it a strength or a weakness in a highly partisan atmosphere to try to be a centrist?",
        "Well, I reject a little bit the generational argument because I think that the generational divide--you can find younger politicians who embrace inclusive politics, you can find younger politicians who don't embrace the politics of inclusion, and the same with politicians who are on the other side of the generational divide.",
        "I think the real division is not so much whether or not you're born after 1960 or after 1965; the real division is what your experiences have been and how you can use those experiences to serve the people that you represent.",
        "I'm a very strong believer that for Democrats to regain the House and Senate, to take the White House back, we've obviously got to find out how we can reach out to people who have not been voting for Democrats.",
        "That's self-evident.",
        "And we can't just be a party that bashes what the Republicans do without having some constructive alternative to put on the table.",
        "We have to have our own compelling vision of what this country ought to be and I think we've gotten one.",
        "We're a party that believes that if you work in this country, you ought to have a shot at opportunity, you ought to have a shot at health care, you ought to have a shot at being able to take care of your family and send your kids to college, and we understand that government can play a role in making those things happen.",
        "Final point that I'll make is that those of us who are trying to push the Democratic Party forward recognize that we have to be a commonsense party.",
        "We have to be a party that speaks to people's basic sense of values and their basic sense of what our country ought to be.",
        "We're a country that believes in fair play for people.",
        "We're a country that believes if you work hard, you ought to be rewarded for that.",
        "We're not a country that believes in government of the privileged, by the privileged and for the privileged, and that's what we've had the last four years.",
        "But we have to be direct about those things, and we have to paint this picture for the American people if we're going to be successful.",
        "Before we let you go, I want to do two things.",
        "First of all, want to ask you about some of the other legislation you've been involved in, or the votes.",

        "What do those decisions say about how you operate in this highly partisan world of left and right?",

        "Well, I voted against the flag-burning amendment, which is not a popular vote with everyone in the state of Alabama, but this is the reality.",
