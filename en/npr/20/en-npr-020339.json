        "There are limitations to a big church role in Cuba.",
        "Catholicism is not yet as popular as church leaders there hoped it would become after the first papal visit - or the second, by Benedict XVI in 2012.",
        "Evangelical denominations do better, as does Santeria, the Afro-Caribbean religious practice.",
        "Another factor, Cuban authorities haven't been willing to cede much authority to the church as an institution outside their direct control.",

        "I think it has to fear, with the church as with everything else, that if it gives an inch, it may be losing much more.",
        "They have gotten used to a very vertical system of control.",
        "And so for them to cede anything is to cede too much.",

        "We have had frightening and uncertain periods in our country where we faced what we call a constitutional crisis.",

        "Well, let me clarify just a little further.",
        "The poverty rate - a hundred and eighty-five percent or less of poverty - adds up to a monthly income of less than about $1500 for a family of three in 1989.",
        "What our study showed is that there has been a steady increase in many places across the nation, but especially in the South, in the concentration of low income students in public education institutions.",
        "In 2003, the South had approximately 48 percent low income students in the public schools.",
        "In 2006, our study shows that we have 53.89 or almost 54 percent of all the students in the public schools are poor.",
        "Our report has a breakdown by states of those where the heavily concentrated poor students are located.",
        "But particularly in the South: Alabama has 54 percent; Arkansas, 53; Florida, 62; Georgia, 52; Kentucky, 50; Louisiana, 84 percent; Maryland, 31; Mississippi, 75 percent; North Carolina, 49 percent; South Carolina, 52 percent.",
        "In the…",
        "Lynn, let me jump in for a second.",
        "Do you see any reason why this concentration has gone up or is it that the concentration of poor students has gone up or that other students have left the system?",
        "We believe that it is that the concentration of low income students has gone up.",
        "And our report indicates that there are three primary factors for this: The first is that the South itself has concentrated poverty.",
        "About 40 percent of all poor people in the United States live in the South, and there has not been, in recent years, any significant anti-poverty program either at the state or local level in many Southern states.",
        "Secondly, there are high rates of underemployment in many Southern states and high rates of unemployment, so there's been a decline in the real value of wages and family income over the last few years; and that has fueled an increase in the number of low income students.",
        "And finally, we have differential birth rates with low income people tending, as a group, to have more children than more affluent people.",
        "We also have in the South, as well as other parts of the nation, a significant increase in Latino children, many of whom are from low income backgrounds and, as well, low income people, particularly Latinos and African-Americans, tend to have a differentially high birth rate compared to other student groups.",
        "Well, Lynn, we have a link to your study on our Web site which is nprnewsandnotes.org.",
        "I want to turn to Joseph now.",
        "You are a teacher at Kipp Ways Academy in Atlanta.",
        "What kind of demographic do you have in terms of income?",
        "Well, in income, we have about 83 percent free or reduced lunch which basically means that we're talking about a school with a majority of low income students.",
        "We're also dealing with the school of 99 percent African-Americans.",
        "So when you look at your student body, do you consider them segregated - segregated, not just racially, but economically?",
        "A clip from the new movie \"\"The Kite Runner.\"\" The film's release was delayed due to controversy over a rape scene crucial to the storyline but would spark fears of reprisals against the Afghan boys in the scene.",

        "It just shows that.",
        "And that's pretty much true to what Kabul was before the Soviet invasion.",
        "I mean, I've read guidebooks about Kabul and they were written in the '60s and people talk about how men basically wore Western-style suits, women wore, you know, the kinds of things that you might wear in Paris or, obviously, that was perhaps the elite.",
        "But nonetheless, that completely disappeared under the Taliban.",
        "And really, it still really hasn't come back.",
        "I mean, the Taliban imported the burka for everybody, of course, in Afghanistan, and particularly in Kabul.",
        "And that has not, you know, really changed that dramatically even six years after the fall of the Taliban.",
        "Amir's father, also an important character in the movie, says at one point before the Soviet invasion, the mullahs want to save our souls.",
        "The communist tell us we don't have one.",
        "Right.",
        "And of course, you know, Afghanistan has suffered, you know, very greatly as a result of that dispute - whether it was the communist killing a million Afghans and then, of course, the Taliban who imposed their own brutal regime."
