        "Hi.",
        "Thanks, Neal.",
        "Sure.",
        "I certainly think you may have sort of addressed what I was going to say, which is that I loved the book, but I found the scenes, particularly when he returns to Afghanistan with the whole child exploitation just two much.",
        "And it felt to me like the author was trying to demonize the Taliban when they really did need to be demonized to that degree.",
        "Well, I mean, you know, the Taliban were undoubtedly not the world's greatest bunch of people, but they weren't the Khmer Rouge.",
        "And so if -on that scale of whether the Khmer Rouge killed, you know, 30 percent of their own population, the Taliban - they, you know, they did a lot of bad things.",
        "The movie, I think, is a desolation of some things that are true, but if a viewer went to the movie thinking that that explained everything about the Taliban, that would be wrong, because the one thing they did bring to Afghanistan was peace and security, which was one of the reasons they were quite popular when they first emerged.",
        "Also, they suppressed the growth of poppies.",
        "Indeed.",
        "And the drug trade.",
        "Thanks very much, Amanda.",

        "The boy is portrayed as a Hazara.",
        "Tell us who that is and is that depiction accurate of him as a sort of a second-class citizen?",
        "Well, it think that depiction, it was quite accurate.",
        "The Hazaras have long been discriminated against in Afghanistan because: A, they are Shia and they are sorts of rather small minority; B, they appear as a kid in the film Hassan, looks - he looks Asiatic.",
        "The Hazaras actually look very different from those Afghans.",
        "They've been long discriminated against and actually, they are one of the - in the post-Taliban era, they are one of the good news stories in Afghanistan, Neal, is the Hazara have done pretty well.",
        "They've gone from being, you know, not second-class citizens, but fifth-class citizens to really enjoying more equal rights.",
        "The only female governor of Afghanistan, interestingly, is a Hazara in the area where mostly Hazaras live in Bamiyan."

        "I certainly agree with the general proposition, but it's a more nuanced picture of Afghanistan than we often see in the media.",
        "However, I mean, as Neal mentioned earlier, the fact that these two kids have actually had to be taken out of the country because they may well face reprisals because of the ethnic tensions in Afghanistan, and it's a movie, it's not true.",

        "Fiction.",
        "It's fiction.",
        "But the fact that they - the producers actually does in a very responsible way, I think, delayed the release of the movie for several weeks because of this issue, I mean, I think that speaks as some of the kind of contemporary truce in Afghanistan.",
        "The ethnic tensions are much lower than they used to be, but they continue to exist.",
        "Prishant, let me ask you, are you an Afghan?",
