        "People can become completely adapted to overnight work, but most do not, even if they work permanent night shifts.",
        "And the reason for that is that on their days off they typically flip back into trying to function during the daytime and sleeping at night.",
        "And...",
        "On the weekends and that type thing.",
        "But nonetheless, most nightshift workers never fully adapt to their schedules, and hence it is more difficult for them to sustain alertness and performance when they're working at night.",

        "They are allowed to smoke cigarettes while they're being paid, during a break.",
        "But they're not allowed to do the one thing that would help prepare them for work when they're on break, which would be to take a brief nap.",
        "And in your view, would that help?",
        "Studies done by NASA for the FAA in relationship to pilots have shown that a brief, 20-minute nap greatly increases the ability to sustain alertness during the remainder of a flight.",
        "And yet, FAA regulations do not allow pilots to nap in the cockpit.",
        "So on one out of 10 trans-Atlantic flights, the pilots are nodding off in the cockpit, but it's not scheduled or controlled in any way.",
        "It would be far better to recognize that it's going to happen, to schedule it and to ensure that it doesn't happen at unscheduled times than to simply ban it and pretend that it's going to go away.",
