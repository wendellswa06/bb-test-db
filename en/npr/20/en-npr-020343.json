        "After that plane and its passengers were detained for some hours, they were allowed to continue on to Damascus, but Turkish aircraft have been warned away from Syrian airspace in fear of, I guess, a tit-for-tat response.",
        "Has there been any response from Damascus?",
        "Nothing that we've heard yet.",
        "Most of the response has come - well, sorry.",
        "There was a - the transport minister did say that this was air piracy, and he said this was in contravention of a number of civil aviation treaties.",
        "Whether they pursue that complaint, remains to be seen.",
        "Before he can act the part, he needs the technique.",
        "As for retaliation, Turkish aircraft were told, have been pretty much avoiding Syria airspace already, not anywhere that they really want to go.",
        "Of course you remember in June, a Turkish fighter jet was shot down after straying into Syrian airspace.",
        "So the civilian aircraft from Turkey tend to go around Syria anyway, but yes, they have been warned to be very careful now.",
        "Is there any appetite that you can discern on either side to escalate even further?",
        "I wouldn't call it an appetite, but I would also say that no one is putting the brakes on, either.",
        "We're hearing a lot of rhetoric now, the nationalist nature on both sides and the chief of the general staff, the top military person, was down here on the Turkish side of the border very recently, and he made a point of saying if this happens again - which I take to mean another mortar that kills people, like the one last Wednesday - then the response will be even stronger.",
        "So you can tell from that that it really doesn't take much to ratchet up the tensions, and some point it could, of course, get out of control.",
        "We're talking with NPR foreign correspondent Peter Kenyon, who's on the Turkish side of the Syrian border.",
        "If you have questions about the rising tensions on Syria's borders, give us a call, 800-989-8255.",

        "Turkey is a member of NATO.",
        "I believe according to the agreements among various NATO members that if one nation or one member of NATO is attacked or threatened, the other nations come to that one party's aid.",
        "And the implications are very, very serious now, I believe, especially when you think that Turkey is on one side of the Black Sea, and Russia's on the other.",
        "Peter Kenyon, she's absolutely right.",
        "She's referring to Article V of the NATO treaty, an attack on one is an attack on all.",
        "Yes, yes, and Mr. Rasmussen, I believe his name is, from NATO has said quite clearly that Turkey can count on NATO to help defend it if it is attacked.",
        "Now what constitutes an attack and what kind of defense would be offered, that may be subject to further negotiation depending on how things play out.",
        "But clearly, that is one added danger.",
        "If a NATO members gets engaged in an open conflict here with Syria, what does that mean for other NATO members, including the U.S.? That's something that people here have been thinking quite a bit about.",
        "And Nancy, in part to answer your question, this is a clip of tape from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, yesterday, at the National Press Club, who said, quote, I think Syria is probably the most complex issue of all to arise from the Arab Spring.",
        "But he also showed there is no indication of any kind that intervention is imminent.",
        "We continue to plan for a number of contingencies.",
        "We're prepared to provide options if those options are required, and that's not just options internal to the United States.",
        "As you know, Syria is bordered on the north by Turkey, a very close NATO partner, and so we're working through NATO, as well, to understand, to try to clarify and to try to collaborate on planning that ultimately might be useful.",
        "But the military instrument of power at this point is not the prominent instrument of power that should be applied in Syria.",
        "Nancy, thanks very much for that call.",
        "And Peter, as we're talking about the situation on the border, fighting of course continues in Syria, including reports of bitter fighting in Azamarin, near the Turkish border.",
        "What's the latest on that?",
        "Well, that's very close to a town here in Turkey called Haji Pasha, and reporters have been down in Haji Pasha today and could hear that fighting and could see the results, which was a fairly substantial spike in the number of refugees coming across.",
        "There's a river there that small boats have been ferrying people across, and they wind up either in homes here or in camps."

        "There's also been reports of very heavy shelling in the southern suburbs of Idlib, which is the big city in the north here other than Aleppo, and one report that I don't have any details on yet but of a very large explosion, at least according to opposition activists, shook the capital, Damascus.",
        "So we're waiting for details on that.",
        "And of course the tension on the borders is not isolated to Turkey, though there has been military fire across that frontier.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "There's been people killed and wounded severely on the Lebanese side, and Jordan has seen a tremendous influx of refugees, and also in Iraq there's been problems.",
        "So yeah, all of the neighbors have some story to tell and some variation on the fear that this could spill over into a wider regional conflict, absolutely.",
        "And continuing concerns about the depth of the humanitarian crisis as more and more refugees pour across the borders.",
        "Yes, international aid officials are increasingly concerned about the will to keep up the amount of aid and getting the aid to the people who need it most, and mainly, of course, they're focused on the neighbors, the people outside.",
        "Possibly the worst crisis might be the internally displaced people because of course many Syrians when they are mortared or bombed or shot out of their town, or they flee because they're afraid of that happening, they try and seek shelter inside the country, and they wind up displaced, sometimes with family but sometimes just on their own, and their situations can be quite desperate.",
        "And getting aid into those areas is much, much harder.",
        "And given the Turkish military's presence on the frontier, is there in fact a de facto strip inside Syria that is in the hands of the Syrian rebels?",
        "I wouldn't go quite that far.",
        "I would say that as these artillery barrages have come across from Turkey, there have been withdrawals of troops from certain areas on the Syrian side, which had created in part a de facto buffer zone, but it only would be for a matter of hours, say, and it would move back and forth.",
        "I wouldn't say there's anything that you could count on, day in, day out, day and night, 24/7, as being a safe zone.",
        "Unidentified Man: Ludakris, ladies and gentleman.",
        "Ludakris!",
        "The army has chosen not to go right up to the edge of the border, probably trying to be prudent and not have things spill out of control.",
        "But there was fierce fighting in a town called Khirbet al-Jouz, which is really just one valley over from the Turkish border.",
        "That was just happening a few days ago.",

        "It is a dangerous game indeed, and I think most observers have been perplexed, because at first there was some question about whether this was a mistake the mortar fire across the border, or possibly the opposition.",
        "But it's been repeated several times, and what's probably - you know, some people suspect that what's happening is that Syria is trying to stir up trouble in Turkey because as this situation has drawn out, there's been a rising chorus of criticism against Erdogan, the Turkish prime minister.",
        "There are demonstrations in the capital and other places.",
        "People are fed up.",
        "There are almost 200,000 Syrian refugees in camps in the south of Turkey along the 550-mile border with Syria.",
        "And one's wondering: What is Turkey doing leading the charge and giving home to this insurgency, letting jihadists - many people have been critical in saying, and especially the secular Turks, saying why are you letting all these foreign jihadists go through Turkey into Syria.",
        "Some of them are al-Qaida, and we're turning into a supporter of these Islamist groups.",
        "We don't want to be there.",

        "So Turks are very anxious about where this is leading them, and they don't want to get sucked into a possible Vietnam on their border.",
        "So Assad, in a sense, could be trying to stick his finger in this beehive and stir up opposition to Erdogan in Turkey and letting Turkey know there's a price.",
        "You lead the insurgency in Syria, we can hurt you back again, and don't think this is going to be for free.",
        "And so the world is worrying about the international repercussions, and it could just spill over into Lebanon and Jordan and Turkey.",
        "And Assad, in a sense, has a reason to let the neighbors know don't mess with us, don't help the insurgency, it will spill over.",
        "There is also this incident of the plane, which seems to be on a different level.",
        "The Russians in rejecting any allegations that there was military equipment aboard that plane said look, we continue to ship supplies to Syria, our ally, but we do so through regular channels.",
        "We would not do it this way.",
        "If, as Prime Minister says, there was missile parts and other kinds of equipment on the cargo section of that passenger plane that was forced down in Ankara yesterday, that smacks of some desperation.",
        "These are things badly needed in Damascus.",
        "They are badly needed, but it's also - Erdogan is taking the Syrian bait, to a certain degree.",
        "He can't allow the Syrians to stir up problems in his country, and what he's doing is, in a sense, by meeting this will full force and saying this is a national - tantamount to an invasion of Turkey, he's beating the war drums himself in order to galvanize the nation.",
        "This could backfire severely on Assad, because if Turkey - if Turks close ranks and say, you know, we're not going to stand by as Syria does this sort of thing, it could backfire badly.",
        "And I think Erdogan is trying to use - he's rattling the saber a little bit, to close ranks.",
