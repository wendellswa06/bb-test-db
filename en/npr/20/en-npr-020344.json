        "And I wanted to ask if Joshua Landis' analysis, if that matches your appreciation of the situation.",
        "Look, I think one way of looking at this is that Assad has to win and defeat the rebels and the uprising, otherwise he'll most likely die.",
        "So he's going to use any tool and instrument available to him to make sure that international opposition to him does not build up to lead to intervention in support of the rebels to oust the Assad regime.",
        "How you doing?",
        "Black people make some noise!",
        "Where ya'll at?",
        "This is how it goes: A lot of the areas controlled by the Free Syrian Army rebels are in northern Syria, literally in some cases just yards away from Turkish border.",
        "And Assad is shelling these areas, and this requires precision artillery shelling.",
        "It's part of the military that requires highly developed skills.",
        "The Syrian army is not known necessarily for its strength in precision targeting with artillery, and they use Russian weapons, which are not the best suited for precision targeting.",
        "So they might have as well overshoot into Turkish territory and killed Turkish citizen, but that absolutely broadened Turkish reaction because there's a government in Ankara which has to react to public pressure, and you cannot just sit and watch when shells fall into your territory and kill people.",
        "So Turkey's reaction, whether or not Assad meant it, I think was not unexpected, and we could anticipate that in the future if Assad decides whether his aim is to provoke Turkey or that his troops inadvertently shell Turkish territory, Turkey's going to respond in kind and proportionally.",
        "Therefore even if these news from the Turkish-Syrian frontier disappear for a few days that we don't hear anymore shelling, it's not unexpected that we'll see such incidences in the future.",
        "And the question is, next time there's another shelling of Turkish territory, accidental or not, what if it kills even more people?",
        "What is Turkey going to do then?",
        "It will probably react with even stronger force, and you're going to see further escalation on the border.",
        "And as Joshua Landis pointed out, this is not universally popular in Turkey, far from it.",
        "Prime Minister Erdogan has to look to his own base.",
        "Absolutely, and I think Turkey's policy, which has made Ankara the spearhead of international opposition to Assad's policies and his crackdown and his slaughter of civilians, has put Turkey, sort of, in a dangerous place because Ankara does not want to be too exposed to the crisis.",
        "That's why I think Turkey is really trying to make sure that it has NATO and the United States backing it and that it's not left on its own should the conflict escalate further.",
        "Then there's the whole issue of the terror attacks conducted by the PKK.",
        "It's not a coincidence in my view, and this is how a lot of Turks see it, as well, that there's been a spike in PKK attacks against Turkey, and that spike pretty much coincides with the time Turkey's Syria flipped.",
        "So around the same time Turkey decided to confront Assad back in August last year, 2011, suddenly you saw a rise in PKK attacks against Turkey."

        "In the last 14 months, these attacks have caused 700 casualties inside Turkey.",
        "That's a big toll for any democratically elected government.",
        "So people are probably saying, in Turkey, that because Turkey confronted the regime and because Assad's regime's chief regional protector and patron, Tehran, is encouraging the PKK to attack Turkey, so Turkey is having what is called a boomerang effect of its policy.",
        "It's not Syria, but it's Syria's regional patron Iran that's encouraging these attacks, which is causing casualties, which is leading the public to say well, what are we going to do about this.",
        "And I think that's why the government reacted to the shelling, also to placate some of these public concerns that Turkey's talking a lot but not doing enough.",
        "So now the public is probably saying, or feeling relieved that the government has responded to the latest shelling.",
        "Let's get a caller in on the conversation.",
        "Chase(ph) is on with us from Cowtown, New Jersey.",
        "My question: you guys started talking about the Kurdish minority.",
        "Are they hoping to oust Assad, or are they hoping to keep that as a regional instability?",
        "Because I know that they want, you know, their own corner of the world for their own country.",
        "Are they working with the rebels, or are they, kind of, biding their time and seeing what happens?",
        "Joshua Landis, the Kurds of Syria are located in the northeastern corner of that country that borders both Turkey and then onto Iraq.",
        "From what we understand, they've established something of an autonomous zone there.",
        "They have indeed, and the Syrian government, some people suggest, have helped them do that.",
        "And when Syria got caught in Aleppo, with bad fighting in Aleppo, it had to withdraw many of its troops from the northeast, which is the heavily Kurdish area.",
        "About 10 percent of Syria are Kurds.",
        "And in withdrawing its troops, it's handed power without any shots over to the PKK.",
        "The Kurds inside Syria have been divided between two major groups.",
        "The PKK seems to be more aligned with the Syrian government.",
        "It's anti-Turkish.",
        "The Kurdish National Council, this, sort of, an umbrella group of different Kurdish parties, has been allied more with the Syrian rebels, the Free Syrian Army and the Turks.",
        "So Syria handed it off to Turkey's enemies, the PKK, and this is has helped to hurt Sunni-Arabs in Syria, the common enemy.",
        "And so in a way, you could say the answer to the question here, is that the Kurds who are against Assad have been very quiet, and they've stood outside of this conflict, taking a neutral position.",
        "But Assad has helped the more radical elements of the Kurdish opposition because they're anti-Turkish, and they're anti-Free Syrian Army.",
        "And so in a sense, there is a complicit - an alliance, if you would, between, at least, a dominant Kurdish group in the northeast and the Assad regime.",
        "And, Soner Cagaptay, there's another player here, and that is the autonomous Kurdish zone in Iraq.",
        "True.",
        "And in fact, the Iraqi Kurds are actually working on a different level.",
        "They're working with Turkey because they've realized that they need Turkey to balance off against Iraq's Shiite-dominated centralized government in Baghdad.",
        "And ironically, believe it or not, Turks and Iraqi Kurds are best friends today, compared to only a few years ago where a lot of people were concerned about tense relations between Iraqi Kurds and Ankara.",
        "So the Iraqi Kurds are telling Ankara that they can help Ankara in the region, for instance, by unifying the Syrian Kurds.",
        "And they have tried to extend to bring the PKK-supporting Kurds to Syria into an agreement so that this group is now saying it will not target Turkey."

        "Of course, we'll have to wait and see how long that deal holds.",
        "I think the Syrian Kurds are basically sitting on a fence.",
        "They don't want to bear the brunt of the uprising.",
        "They're letting the Sunni-Arabs take care of that or bear that burden, but they're also waiting for the collapse of the regime before they can really rise up.",
        "And for the time being, I think they're just taking control over territory in northeast Syria and also pockets in the northwest near Aleppo, in anticipation of a collapse of the regime.",

        "So that means that Assad's fall is not going to necessarily bring quick stability to Syria, because you're going to see tensions between ethnic Arabs and ethnic Kurds in that country.",
        "And the Iraqi Kurds are obviously promising to unify the Kurdish opposition, and I think they're just telling the Syrian Kurds to be quiet.",
        "But we also know that the Iraqi Kurds are training Syrian Kurds, so this is probably in anticipation of the day after Assad.",

        "What I'm curious though - my question is, from our perspective, whether it's military or our government, what something, whether it's spillover into another country, what is that kind of one thing that we really don't want to happen?",
        "Is it spilling over, or is it, you know, is it - I know it's kind of a loaded question.",

        "It's not supplying Stinger missiles or ground-to-air missiles, which is what the Syrian opposition needs to neutralize the Syrian air force.",
