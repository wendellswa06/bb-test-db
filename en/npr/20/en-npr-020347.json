        "Peter Balakian, the preeminent scholar of the genocide and co-translator of a new widely-lauded family memoir called \"\"Armenian Golgotha: A Memoir of the Armenian Genocide,\"\" told us this week he admires President Obama for telling Turkish leaders that confronting the past and restoring good relations with Armenia is important.",
        "But he believes that Turkey's campaign against acknowledging its genocide raises questions about their reliability.",
        "Mr. Balakian told us a country that spends millions of dollars a year in an effort to stop the facts about the Armenian genocide from being known and that persecutes and prosecutes its own citizens for speaking truthfully about the extermination of the Armenians is hardly a government to trust to broker honest and just foreign policy.",
        "In a way, the president's choice to say killings in front of his host may just remind us it might be wise to regard what any politician says as the words of a suitor who coos I love you during courtship.",
