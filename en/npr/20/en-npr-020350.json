        "And is it going to continue to be a big story in 2008 and beyond?",
        "Most certainly, on two levels.",
        "It's had an incredible effect both on Wall Street and on Main Street.",
        "On the Wall Street level, how much worse is it going to get?",
        "I mean, Wall Street banks have already written off billions of dollars in mortgage paper that they held.",

        "Nobody knows how bad it's going to be.",

        "Is this the end of the Greenspan era?",
        "Mr. Greenspan has been defending himself lately against what he admits were some missteps, I suppose, failure to regulate?",
        "In Alan Greenspan's world, all the missteps appear to have been made by other people.",
        "His record is not very good on this issue.",
        "He could have done things earlier.",
        "He could have tried to tighten standards.",
        "He could have, at least used his bully pulpit to raise alarms about subprime and he did none of that.",
        "The most telling fact is that the current Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, is behind the Federal Reserve effort, which will do exactly what Greenspan didn't do, which is tighten lending standards and make it harder to give loans to people who can't afford to pay them back.",
        "Let's move on to China, which was another big business story in 2007.",
        "I think most of us focused on the recalls of defective and dangerous toys.",
        "Do you think that everybody looking at China as we think about the Beijing Olympics?",
        "Will we see China change?",
        "I do think China will change on this issue, but not necessarily because of the Olympics.",
        "If you're going to have globalization, everybody has to be able to play by the same rules, and everybody has to be able to count on the other party to do what they're supposed to do.",
        "So what's really going to happen is economics is going to solve this problem.",
        "It's a good lesson for the Chinese that contracts, global rules are there for a reason, and you renege on them or ignore them at your economic peril.",

        "And one of the big rumors for 2008 is that Google will get into the cell phone business and begin to not just make mobile software but basically cell phones.",
        "So can Google keep doing this, just pushing and pushing - the sky is the limit?",

        "Let's get a little more specific in terms of your character Eddie Sutton and how much, if any, of Eddie Sutton is Russell?",
        "I've created the character based on two family members of mine who work in law enforcement and government in the Roxbury section of Boston, Massachusetts.",
        "Two uncles of mine, Franklin and Edward Red(ph) - one is a judge and the other is a constable.",

        "And that is what I wanted to focus on, that Eddie, he physically left, but his spirit was always there.",
        "That really came through for me in the scene where, in this robbery, where you - your character, Eddie Sutton, had to shoot and kill - well, you shoot and kill the kid who he was trying..."
