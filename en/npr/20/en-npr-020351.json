        "But the whole issue then becomes, again, the White House now versus Republicans and Democrats in Congress who feel that the president has overstepped his bounds on claims of executive privilege, especially when it comes to the firing of the prosecutors, and you come to people like Sarah Taylor, who was the political director under Karl Rove, why she can't testify people are perplexed, and when she did testify recently and claimed the executive privilege direction from the president not to say anything, she then went on to give some answers and so totally bollixed and confused the issue.",

        "That's what caused Obama then to strike back, and Obama feels that he is getting to Mrs. Clinton's left, which is where he wants to be for the base of the party in a primary election.",
        "And again, he's emphasizing that he's different, that he is not the same as Mrs. Clinton.",
