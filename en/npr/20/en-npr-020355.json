        "And tell us, one of the most controversial aspects of this federal shield law are exemptions for national security.",
        "What kind of exemptions would be required?",
        "Well, first of all, the proposed bill would allow reporters to protect sources only if they were reporting about a leak that - about an incident that happened in the past where they, for example, uncovered a government mistake or misconduct and there's no tangible, no imminent threat that - of any kind of a harm to national security.",
        "Then...",
        "So this would cover that so-called ticking time bomb case if the reporter has information - the information is vital to uncover some case?",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, if a reporter had information that something was going to blow up, then obviously that reporter would have to turn over that information.",
        "It would be very, very difficult for the reporter not to do so.",
        "And that's the case now, Neal.",
        "There's no such protection existing at this moment.",
        "Well, there are broader protections.",
        "In this case, some reporters' protective groups have said, wait a minute, we're not - we think these exemptions go a little too far.",
        "For example, in your reporting on the anthrax case, would you have been protected?",
        "Well, no, probably not at the trial court level because of the way that Judge Walton looked at the case.",
        "In his opinion, anything and everything that was written about Dr. Hatfill violated Dr. Hatfill's Privacy Act rights.",
        "It's a different ballgame.",
        "We were talking about Privacy Act in the Hatfill case, and national security is a completely different ballgame.",
        "So I see.",
        "This case is wending its way through Congress.",
        "What is different is that there is president of the United States, Barack Obama, who has said that he will, if it's passed, sign it.",
