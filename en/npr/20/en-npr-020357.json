        "But in kind of - and not to downplay my own profession, but in more serious journalism, where you're coming up upon people who, whether you're talking about a crime story or, as the previous caller mentioned, political stories where people are speaking from within the organization on the condition of anonymity, or where you see something that says, you know, by somebody -this quote was given by somebody who wanted to remain anonymous, given the gravity of the situation or the seriousness of the case, how can you then be -how can that source be relied upon from within the organization?",
        "Or is that not a concern of us as journalists?",

        "There's - I think that there's a certain - I think that there's a certain concern when you're dealing with your sources who are giving you this inside information that you're not supposed to have.",
        "What's our responsibility as journalists to say, yes, we have a duty to (unintelligible) to serve the public and present information to the public.",
        "But it's kind of also essential -if this information is supposed to be classified or it's so important that the information is not revealed by this particular source, how can we count on that information as reliable and count on that source as reliable?",
        "Well, I think what you have to do as a reporter - at least what I did when I was a reporter - was that I - you have to weigh the importance of the information.",
        "Is this something that the public should know?",
        "And if you answer that yes, then you go forward with publishing the information.",

        "That's Democrat Gavin Newsom, who will be on the ballot this November running for governor of California.",

        "What happened?",
        "What happened is the Democrats, as you said, were in danger of being shut out because California uses a top-two primary system - the top two vote-getters go on to the general election - could be two Democrats, two Republicans.",
        "But because Democrats had so many candidates running, they were worried that they would split the Democratic vote and two Republicans would get through and go on to the general election.",
        "That didn't happen.",
        "There are seven competitive districts held by Republicans in California.",
        "The Democrats think they have a chance to flip.",

        "They spent a tremendous amount of money, and they managed to get a Democrat on the general election ballot in every one of these races.",
        "And those seven seats would go a long way towards the 23 that Democrats need to regain control of the House."
