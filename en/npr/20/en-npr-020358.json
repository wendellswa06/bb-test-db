        "Yeah, the big advantage here is that Facebook has everybody in the tent already.",
        "You could launch a new messenger app today and nobody would use it, unless you got really lucky.",
        "What Facebook can do is, they can get in front of a parade.",
        "They don't have to start a parade.",
        "So they could put this in front of 750 or 800 million registered users right now, and get immediate uptake of some significant degree.",
        "Here's what I don't understand.",
        "If Verizon makes money from my texting when I use ordinary messaging, how is it that Facebook can deliver the same service without getting any money for it?",
        "Well, what Facebook is doing is, they're rolling the message through a different network.",
        "They are rolling it over the Web through their own platform.",
        "They're rolling it through Facebook, basically.",
        "So they are re-creating a channel that is just like the texting you're using on SMS, but it's through a Facebook server.",
        "And so they are taking a side road around - not really cutting out the middleman, but taking a different route to get the message there.",
        "But I assume, then, that if I were a mobile carrier manning the tollbooth on the main highway, I'd be pretty upset about these detours going on.",
        "Yes.",
        "As I look at an app like this, I see the carriers perhaps having some pushback.",
        "They obviously want you to use as much data on your plan as possible.",
        "Because if they're lucky, you'll use more data than you're currently paying for and either get stuck with an overage charge at the end of the month or you'll say OK, that didn't feel good.",
        "I'm going to raise my plan.",
        "What are some potential downsides, though, to Facebook?",
        "Well, when you install anything from Facebook, you get that sort of - that tinge of invasiveness.",
        "That's something where Facebook is a, let's say a contentious entity.",
        "Whereas most of us will look at email and texting and we'll see that as, yeah, those are just generic utilities - I don't feel like there's anybody in there promoting it or bringing it to me in a way where they want something, where they have an ulterior motive.",
        "When you look at Facebook, you say OK, what do they want?",
        "All users pretty much realize now: They want my information.",
        "They want to have their fingers in my communications so they can better tune advertising to me.",
        "And a lot of people are uncomfortable with that.",

        "That was the year that, for those who didn't immediately pick up on it, is Thomas Hobbes wrote \"\"Leviathan.\"\" And Thomas Hobbes was talking all about how man is in a state of nature, and we are at war with each other all the time, 24/7.",
        "Then you put your character in the dentist's office, give them a toothache, and you keep on with your story.",

        "Yeah, well, there's the conscious self, the conscious self that was creating the story, thinking of the story, remembering the story.",
        "And then there's this unconscious self where ideas and notions, thoughts, ideas, they just appear inside the text.",

        "Well, I mean all art, the first draft, the first thing that you do, it's going to be flawed.",
        "It might not be really bad, but it's not going to be good enough to, you know, to hang in a gallery, to be published by some publisher.",
        "You have to work at it.",
        "You have to work and rework and rework.",
