        "And, you know, you repeat that again when you're talking about dialogue, that the dialogue needs to be pedestrian.",
        "Why would you tell writers to make their characters speak like ordinary people?",
        "Because people look for themselves in novels.",
        "People look for themselves, and then they look for some kind of transcendence.",
        "And so first you have to find yourself in the book.",
        "A guy who talks like you or somebody you know, or a woman who talks like you or somebody you know in a situation, maybe scrambling eggs, maybe falling down and skinning their knee and, you know, and having trouble walking for a couple of chapters in the novel.",
        "This makes a real character that the reader can identify with.",
        "And so once the reader understands and identifies with this main character, then we can bring them to a further level.",
        "If you start off on the whole level that, you know, that's, you know, above human experience, the novel doesn't really touch your humanity.",
        "You also write about, you know, that the novel is in the details.",
        "Yet you also advise that you can get lost in details.",
        "Well, there are so many details in life.",
        "If you just look around the room you're sitting in, in order to write down every detail of the room that you're in - the physical details, maybe other people doing things in the room, the history of the room, possibly - you'd write hundreds and hundreds of pages.",
        "And so you only have to pick out the major details.",
        "And those details either have to do with the story, the development of the story, the characters, how those characters are feeling and how those characters are interacting.",
        "Those are the only details that you can really afford to put in your novel.",
        "Once you understand that, choosing details becomes a very simple thing.",

        "Writing a novel, the temptation is to emphasize the thinking rather than the actions of characters.",
        "Please comment on this.",

        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I think that we live in very physical worlds and novels are very physical things.",
        "We're talking about how people move forward and how their movement affects their emotional life.",
        "Because the novel is about the psyche, and the psyche is, I think, a little bit more emotional than it is intellectual.",
        "There's a lot that the characters don't understand, don't know.",
        "Maybe the reader understands about the character, but the characters themselves may not understand very much about themselves at all.",
        "I think novels are very, very physical, and that the more physical you can make a book, the more powerful that book will be emotionally.",
        "Every book, you say, no matter what time period in which you set it, every book is about today.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...you're addressing this world today.",
        "So, you know, when Bradbury writes \"\"Fahrenheit 451,\"\" he's not talking about some far future where people are burning up books.",
        "He's talking about our minds and our lives today.",
        "And that's why sometimes you read certainly old science fiction or old period pieces and they just feel old.",
        "Yeah, because - well, any book that you read that, you know, comes from another time is about that time.",
        "There are also universal qualities to novels.",
        "I mean, if you're very good or maybe unconsciously very good, your book may speak to people 10,000 years from now.",
        "But that's really not what a novelist should be worrying about.",
        "It's hard enough just to tell that story, to develop those characters in a language which is interesting and engaging which unfolds in a way where the reader says I wonder what happens next and they keep turning the page."

        "Why do so many writers who claim to love writing, like myself, procrastinate getting their butt into the chair to tackle their story?",
