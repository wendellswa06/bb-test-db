        "Hello, thank you for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",

        "Yeah, Hobbes gave being nasty, brutish and short a bad name.",
        "I have 13 boxes - my mother's journals, and she was a great unpublished writer.",
        "She has a very interesting kind of tragic life.",
        "She had a lot of things unsaid and undone when she died.",
        "And what I'd like to do is take - I'm going through them, and it's very painful.",
        "She was very poetic and very erudite.",
        "And how do I take her journal and write the conversation that I would have liked to have had with her...",
        "That's a very difficult question.",
        "...as a response to her journals?",
        "Well, I think the response is what's important.",
        "I mean, the journals, you know, the journals are written.",
        "They exist.",
        "And, you know, it may be, you know, for other reasons you're going to read through all those journals and know all those things.",
        "But the response, that's from you.",
        "And if it's a novel, then you might take bits and pieces from the journal.",
        "But what you'll discover is that most of the information in your novel, which is a response to these journals that exists, will be unique and will be yours.",
        "It won't be hers."

        "How do you manage to edit a novel-length piece scene by scene and still maintain an all-encompassing view of the novel?",
        "Well, a novel's a lot easier to write than either short stories or poems.",
        "As E.M.",

        "You comb, and you comb, and you comb.",

        "You know when you're done when there's nothing you can do that can make the book better.",
        "It's never going to be perfect.",
        "But when no matter what you do, what you've written is the closest you can get to that story you're trying to tell, that's when you're done."

        "How do you get your novel published?",
        "You know, a writer is the least likely person to have that information.",
        "This is an interesting thing, because everybody thinks we do have it, but we all came to it from different ways.",
        "It's interesting to join a writing workshop, not so much for hearing what people have to say about your writing, but to meet other people who are writing and are interested in writing or teaching writing.",
        "These people have, you know, connections and know different people.",

        "So I finally ended up getting a, like, digital voice recorder.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And, you know, I'm essentially telling the story to myself in the car, and then, you know, it might even be two or three days later where I revisit the recording and then kind of, you know, write it down at that point.",
        "I was just kind of wondering what your thoughts on that were.",
        "And also just suggesting that to other people who may be busy in their lives to get a little digital voice recorder - you know, you might just have this fleeting thought that's really brilliant and then it goes away, you know.",
        "Walter Mosley, I think the response is going to be you violate the first rule, which is to write every day.",
        "But go ahead, Walter.",
        "Yeah, well, that's it.",
        "I have nothing against digital recorders.",
        "As a matter of fact, if somebody wants to write a novel by speaking it, I have nothing against that.",
        "I think that's a perfectly fine way to go about writing your novel.",
        "But I do think that you need to write every day.",
        "I'm less interested in genius and brilliance and more interested in depth and discovery.",
        "What happens is that if you write today and tomorrow and the next day, 65 days out, you're so much deeper into yourself than you were on that first day.",
        "But if any time along that way, you take more than two or three days off of it, you're going to be as far away from it as you were on the first day.",
        "And so I -the idea of a conscious moment of brilliance is - well, yeah, I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying that, for me, it's less important than that, you know, digging and digging and digging deeper and deeper every day until the novel has an absolute structure to itself which is both pedestrian and transcendent."
