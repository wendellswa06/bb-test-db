        "Yeah, Anbar's really become kind of the poster child for the security benefits that accrue through this so-called awakening movement, or as they're known now in Iraq, as the Sons of Iraq, which is thousands of primarily Sunnis who've aligned themselves with the Americans and receive a modest payment and have done so primarily because they wanted to stop the violence that al-Qaeda in Iraq was carrying out against them, and the kidnapping, and just - well, just all sorts of fundamentalist Islamic creed that they're imposing on them.",
        "So, you see that in Anbar, but largely as a consequence of the surge the Anbar awakening spread from Anbar to Diyala to Arab Jabour to other areas of Iraq.",
        "You don't see much of it in the Shia areas, but you see there is a significant amount in the Sunni areas, and that's a double-edged sword.",

        "And so, you can't make generalizations about Baghdad, per se.",
        "But I would say in Sadr City in late March, it was an exceedingly violent place in to early April.",
        "I would say now, it's much better.",
        "However, there's sporadic acts of violence.",
        "There was recently a bombing carried out, which killed a guy from a provincial reconstruction team.",
        "But I think the security is really much improved, and you have to recall that in Sadr City, the American forces are really restricted to the two southern most neighborhoods in Sadr City, Jamila and Thawra.",
        "And the rest of Sadr City is occupied solely by Iraqi forces.",
        "So, I would say it's not so bad right now.",
        "So most of the violence is from IEDs and roadside bombs, and such.",
        "I mean, is there fighting going on there?",
        "Well, there's always some fighting going on, but the major threat to American forces in Iraq for a long time and still is these roadside bombs, and in the Sadr City area, there are a particular type of roadside bomb called an EFP, that American intelligence believes is provided by Iran, essentially, and that's the principle threat.",
        "Are those the armor-piercing?",
        "They're armor-piercing, but what I will say is I went with Iraq clearance team that did a story for the New York Times that finds these things, and they're extremely acciduice (ph).",
        "They go out there and look at every square inch of a road and try to find them before they go off, and they have a pretty high success rate, and also these new M-wrapped vehicles that the American military is introducing also are a vast improvement over the armored Humvees.",
        "Well, that's good to know.",
        "It still doesn't keep me from worrying, but...",

        "We've looked very closely at whether or not Iraq is spending its own money for reconstruction purposes, to help its own people.",
        "We looked at their entire budget for 2007, and we found that of about the roughly 16, 17 billion dollars that they set aside, they've only been spending about 20 percent.",
        "Where's the rest of that money going to?",
        "Well, they're not spending it, and they are having surpluses.",
        "There are predictions that they could have a surplus of anywhere between seven and 10 billion dollars this year alone.",
        "And Michael Gordon, that money, and how it's distributed, well, that's at the heart of a lot of the political problems in Iraq.",
        "Well, the way I look at it is, the regime in Iraq, Prime Minister Maliki and the governing apparatus around him, is stronger politically then it was a few months ago by virtue of his successful operation in Basra and Sadr City, and one shouldn't take away to much from that.",
        "I mean, most people would have thought it was beyond the capabilities of the government to reestablish order there.",
        "That said, he's not really presiding over a functioning state, and when I was in Sadr City, the trash collection that was going on was organized by the American military.",
        "There was no work going on, in terms of restoring the electricity, and yet the Iraqi government had promised 100 million dollars for Sadr City and other conflict areas.",

        "First of all, how would you measure it?",
        "And some of the things that, you know, that have come up would be community service, traffic court, are courts functioning, all of the things that we, in America here, kind of take for granted.",

        "Agency for International Development, Corps of Engineers, but nothing has really integrated.",

        "Michael?",
        "I think the Iraqis are making progress politically, but in their own way, which doesn't always follow our script.",
