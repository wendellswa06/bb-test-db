        "I don't know the specifics on that, but Iran has provided the Iraqi government with a billion-dollar loan, and they are focusing on electrical-generation projects throughout Iraq.",

        "Yes.",
        "Well, apparently, Iran is helping build this thing.",

        "They have programs of economic kind of assistance, essentially, and loans.",
        "They have diplomatic representation.",
        "They're trying to exert their influence in a lot of way, and they have a covert program of lethal assistance to Shiite militant groups.",
        "So there's a struggle for influence in Iraq.",
        "Iran is trying to pursue that, just as the United States is.",

        "Oh, well, I mean, that's a big point of contention right now between the Kurdistan regional government and the central government.",
        "The Kurds have already put in place about 25 contracts with international oil firms that the central government objects to, believing that it would be against any laws that would be finalized on the hydrocarbon legislation.",
        "So that is the number one reason why oil legislation is not progressing in Iraq.",
        "Well, it's not so much a sectarian thing.",
        "It's also a matter of who gets the profits, can the profits be taken out of the country, what is the division of profits, and all that kind of stuff.",
        "Sure, absolutely.",
        "That - oil legislation not only defines who gets what in Iraq, but it defines terms and conditions of foreign investors.",
        "They want to be reassured that their investments aren't going to be in jeopardy, and they want everything in law.",
        "Pair, thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "Good question.",
        "Yes.",
        "And Michael, this goes to some of the questions about the operation that the government staged in Basra.",
        "Again, very important to take that town back from militias, and not just the Sadr army - the Mahdi army, excuse me.",
        "But some people suspect - well, first of all, I guess the Sunnis were pleased the government was taking on the Shia militia, not just the Sunni militias.",
        "But then some of the Sunnis were concerned that this was just trying to pave the way for the creation of a Shia super state, regional power in southern Iraq.",
        "The Basra operation, Charge of the Knights, I think, was the official name for it, was very important in a lot of respects.",
        "One was that the Iraqi government did not ask the Americans' permission to do this operation.",
        "It notified the American ambassador, Ryan Crocker, and essentially General Petraeus that it planned to do this, and they did it in a matter of days after this notification.",
        "So, I think that was interesting just as a demonstration of their capacity, or desire to act sometimes in ways that we don't always - or find inconvenient.",
        "The initial part of the operation was extremely confused.",
        "There were all sorts of logistical difficulties, which got ironed out and the Americans helped support it.",
        "But it was really necessary to assert their control over Basra.",
        "Basra was a lawless enclave of militias and fundamentalists.",
        "The British had essentially pulled their forces out of the city.",
        "It was a chaotic region.",
        "There were all sorts of human rights abuses there.",
        "So there were legitimate security reasons for the prime minister to assert his authority there.",
        "That said, the operation also had the effect of diminishing the political influence of the Sadrists in that region of Iraq.",
        "So it sort of served a dual purpose.",
        "It was a legitimate, I think, operation to assert control over a region that militias were dominating, and it helped strengthen Maliki's political position vis-a-vis his potential opponents in the upcoming provincial elections.",
        "And his strength was demonstrated by, some say, his willingness to buck the United States on the Status of Forces Agreement, which is also being negotiated at the moment."

        "Well, there was a bit of a nationalism in Iraq, which I think is understandable, and there is this negotiation over the Status of Forces Agreement, and just what sort of rights and leeway the Americans will have.",
        "And how many bases, and for how long, and that sort of thing?",
        "Yeah, I - my guess would be it'll get ironed out certainly before the end of the year, because when it comes down to it, the Iraqi government wants the American forces in Iraq, and they want them to be effective in Iraq.",
        "And I think there will be a mechanism to resolve these outstanding issues.",
        "And Joseph Christoff, let me ask you a question.",
        "When your report says that the numbers the administration is using to measure progress in Iraq, that some of them are incorrect and others are more mixed than the administration would have us believe, is this a case of the administration looking at glasses as all half full, just being rosy?",
        "Or are they cooking the books?",
        "Well, I think it's what they choose to focus on in the data.",
        "For example, let's go back to the readiness of Iraqi security forces.",
        "The administration likes to put forth a 70-percent number.",
        "Seventy percent of Iraqi army battalions are, quote, unquote, \"\"in the lead.\"\" But one of the original benchmarks was to try to increase the number of Iraqi forces that are independent.",
        "That's ten percent.",
        "So it's a matter of what you're focusing on.",
        "All right, Mark.",

        "Have a great day.",

        "You know, from my perspective at GAO, people ask if we're the half-glass-empty crowd and they're the half-full crowd.",
        "I want to just make sure the Congress knows what's in the glass, and I think that's what we try to serve in providing good information so the Congress and the American people can evaluate objectively.",

        "The huge problem has been Iraqi civilian kidnappings.",
        "And some of these - I think a large percentage of these are fairly criminal, as opposed to political.",
        "Is that what you're asking about, Francis?",
        "Exactly.",
        "I think it's a good gauge of sort of the range and trend in general criminality.",
        "Much of the violence there, even during the major war effort, has been related to criminality specifically and not the insurgency.",
        "Any way to measure the number of kidnappings that go on?",
        "Some of them are not reported.",
        "Of course, there are payments made quietly, people are recovered.",
        "Any idea?",
        "You know, the DOD tracks statistics on so many different items, sometimes it's overwhelming.",
        "But you know, that's really interesting about criminality.",
        "I remember from three years ago, I wanted to try to get some information from DOD to separate out the criminality part, and it was difficult to do.",
        "It was difficult to discern a lot of that information about the extent of crime within Iraq, although it's known that it is an important part, particularly with extortions and its associations with militias.",
        "Michael, do you have...",
        "Well, I think the information probably is obtainable, and it's probably obtainable from the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior, because they do tabulate these sorts of statistics on crime.",
        "And when I was out in Baghdad recently I saw, for example, the murder statistics, and what was striking was that murders were down significantly over the past year, which was a measure of that some of the criminal activity was getting under control and some of the sectarian activity was also down.",
        "At the same time, the violence was up, in terms of the fighting with the Mahdi army and the American and the Iraqi forces.",
        "So I think the information is important, and I think it's, in principle, probably obtainable, but probably from Iraqi government sources.",
        "And my guess would be that to the extent the Americans have it, they're getting it from the Iraqi government, particularly from the Interior Ministry.",
        "Francis, thank you."
