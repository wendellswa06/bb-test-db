        "And the electricity, you'd have it on and off.",
        "But at nighttime, since I went in the winter, we had a fairly, like, steady supply at night, which was, you know, when it mattered, because during the day it would be warm, but at night it would be fairly cold.",
        "And in general, are you encouraged or are you optimistic?",

        "I think there's a definite change.",
        "And outside of Baghdad, I was in Diwaniya, Kut, Najaf, Karbala, and I also sensed an improvement.",
