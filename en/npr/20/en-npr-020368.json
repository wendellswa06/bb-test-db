        "But when they did get the questions, the ranking member - Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania asked him about an e-mail that he wrote, Mr. Sampson wrote, that describes a meeting to discuss the dismissals that was attended by the attorney general, an e-mail that contradicts what the attorney general said in public.",
        "I don't think the attorney general's statement that he was not involved in any discussions about U.S.",

        "So he was involved in discussions, contrary to the statement he made in his news conference on March 13th?",
        "I believe - yes, sir.",
        "And this of course catches the attorney general on the horns of his own press conferences.",
        "Yes.",
        "That remains one of the very perplexing aspects of this whole thing, that he would come out and say to the cameras I was not involved in any meetings, any discussions.",
        "And he was involved in meetings and presumably said something at the meetings.",
        "I take it his view is that I wasn't involved in actually picking who was to be fired, I just signed off on it, and therefore I wasn't involved in the discussion.",
        "Tactical discussion.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There's another point at which Sampson contradicted his former boss.",
        "Mr. Gonzales said at that news conference that inaccurate testimony before Congress happened because his chief of staff, Mr. Sampson, did not properly brief the officials who were going to testify.",

        "Correct?",
        "Senator, as I look back on that process, the problem was that we were focused on other questions.",

        "Now, in terms of Mr. Gonzales, does any of this approximate a smoking gun?",

        "So it's very hard to figure out what role Gonzales played in this other than that he's tried to distance himself for some reason from this set of decisions.",
        "So I assume it means that the committee is definitely going to have to hear from him, and he will have to try to answer those questions.",

        "And that's - and so what we still don't know in the end is why were these eight people chosen.",
        "Was it performance, the way Carl Sampson says - like they didn't bring enough immigration charges - or was it that Karl Rove's office heard a lot about -from Republicans in their states who were not happy with these prosecutors and Rove in effect planted the seed for firing these people.",
        "And that raises the question: In Mr. Sampson's testimony today, was Karl Rove in any way implicated?",
        "Did he have any new information about Karl Rove?",
        "Very little.",
        "He knew that - from e-mails we know that Rove was interested in this and was sort of sounding off at times.",

        "And this was the key, I think.",
        "Yes, and the Patriot Act should be revised to require Senate confirmation, 81 percent.",
        "That tends to reflect - I mean notwithstanding all the jokes about the left coast and San Francisco being lefter than thou and everything, there's a lot of anti-Bush sentiment, this is a Democratic bastion in terms of Democratic Party.",

        "In other words, lying and, as they see it, being out of - the way an attorney general's supposed to behave.",
