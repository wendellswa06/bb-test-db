        "E.J., you've written this week about this fault line in the election of the class divide.",
        "And you actually wrote that the rise of Sanders and Trump, in a way, are revealing, quote, \"\"the discontent of Americans who been left out in our return to prosperity\"\".",
        "Right, and you saw that especially in the Michigan primary.",
        "I think, so far, that was the most dramatic case of that.",
        "And you have a very odd circumstance in the country, which is, on the one hand, President Obama has a 53 percent approval rating, which is quite high.",
        "That's the highest it's been in three years.",
        "We had a very good jobs report again today.",
        "And yet, there were a lot of people being left behind, two groups in particular - working-class white men - white people in general, and white men in particular - and a lot of inner-city folks who've been very hurt by the deindustrialization that's gone on.",
        "They've been divided from each other in politics, but their interests are in common.",
        "Trump is speaking to white working-class voters, although he doesn't talk about many specifics.",
        "Bernie is trying to bring those two groups together, but African-Americans have, so far, been quite loyal to Hillary Clinton.",
        "And if she pulls out a victory in New York, which is now critical since they've - the Clinton folks have pretty much given up on Wisconsin, ceding it to Sanders - they're going to be an important part of that.",
        "I want to talk about that for a second.",
        "Yeah, Sanders has been very confident.",
        "Before I get to you, David, I want to play this clip of Sanders on \"\"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\"\" last night.",
        "Colbert asks Sanders why he believes the party's superdelegates should switch from supporting Clinton if he wins additional states.",

        "We have won six out of the last seven caucuses, most of them by landslide victories.",
        "(APPLAUSE)",
        "And I think that superdelegates should listen to the will of their people.",
        "If you get 60, 70, 80 percent of the vote in a state, you know what?",
        "I think superdelegates should vote for us.",
        "(APPLAUSE)",
        "David, there's been so much focus on delegates going into the Republican convention, but what about Democrats?",
        "Has Sanders sort of made a case, right, to the party, right - all of these sort of party higher-ups - that he should be given a second look?",
        "Well, first, Democrats have superdelegates.",
        "And those delegates were designed - the system was designed to favor somebody like Hillary Clinton, and I expect they'll stay there.",
        "Clinton has weakness as a candidate, as we heard just even in the clips just in the last 10 minutes.",
        "She's sort of a paint-by-numbers Democrat.",
        "There's no creativity, no imagination, no new message there.",
        "She's a major political figure with negative approval ratings.",
        "That doesn't happen very often.",
        "If Donald Trump wasn't around, this would be the big story of the campaign.",
        "Nonetheless, Sanders really hasn't moved outside his people.",
        "He's got a clear demographic.",
        "He touches them very deeply, but he hasn't been able to expand outside.",
        "And unless he can pull off a win in New York and California, which I still think is very unlikely, Hillary Clinton looks to be set."

        "Legitimate - listen, he hasn't thought very deeply, and he's cruel to those who are weak, and so both of those factors came up.",

        "The metaphor of a war on terror has been used since 9/11, and it's been sort of an organizing principle of the Bush administration.",
        "If it's not that, what do we call it?",
        "Well, the comparison I like much more than war is disease.",
        "It's a scourge.",
        "It's part of modern life, as I suggested.",
        "There's things you can do to reduce it.",
        "There's things you can do to protect yourself from it.",
        "But it's something that you can't eliminate it.",
        "And I think that's why the disease metaphor, for example, is much closer than the military metaphor."

        "And the division you've got to make is between existing and potential terrorists.",
        "Existing terrorists, you've got to stop them.",
        "That means killing them or using law enforcement to arrest them, and unfortunately if and when they succeed, you've got to take steps that hopefully reduce the consequences.",

        "Essentially, we want to, again, limit the scope of the challenge we face here.",
        "Well, one of the answers proposed by the Bush administration has been the promotion of democracy.",
        "Well, the problem with democracy is that it's awfully hard to promote.",
        "At best, it will take decades or even longer.",
        "And in the meantime, we've got this problem on our hands.",
        "Plus, as we've seen in places like Iraq, you can have elements of democracy, but you also create an environment in which terrorism flourishes - which is exactly what we're seeing, say, on the streets of Baghdad.",
        "Or going back to your previous conversation, you have groups like Hezbollah or Hamas, which do relatively well at the polls and then carry out acts of terrorism.",
        "So maybe over the course of 50 or 100 years, countries or societies which become mature, full-fledged democracies will not carry out acts of terror, but that's not going to help us during that period of transition.",
        "We need a counter-terrorism policy in the meantime, and one that does not depend upon democratic transformation.",
        "And one of the things you point out - even in mature, democratic societies - like Britain - this doesn't always answer the questions.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "I think that's in some ways the most worrisome development we've seen.",
        "And it's the lack of integration of small numbers of individuals in full-fledged, mature, modern democracies.",
        "And that's not something that you can solve by closing your borders.",
        "It's not something you can solve by beefing up your military.",
        "This, then, becomes a challenge to host governments, ways of trying to find them through law enforcement - how to do that, though, in a way that doesn't unduly compromise civil liberties, but it also becomes a challenge for religious leaders.",
        "And one of the things I call for in my own writing is a culture of shaming, a culture of de-legitimizing such individuals.",
        "And we're never going to win this struggle - whatever you want to call it -until the vast majority of Arab leaders, until the vast majority of Muslim leaders will stand up publicly and say people who commit these violent acts, people who take life - innocent life - in the name of some political cause are acting in ways that are contrary to Islam."

        "And again, if you get to the point where you've got to use military force, you're awfully far down the road.",
