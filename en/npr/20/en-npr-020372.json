        "Hi, yes.",
        "I am a Muslim, and I am in the medical field, so I really like your guest's analogy of disease, because terrorism is a disease, and it has a lot of root causes.",
        "And what we see -like a bomb exploding - is a symptom of the disease.",
        "And also, I do agree with him that we cannot win the war on terrorism until all the Muslim scholars and the Muslims agree that this is a bad thing.",
        "A lot of Muslims (unintelligible), but 90 -maybe 99 percent of the Muslim scholars have condemned terrorism.",
        "But what happens, like what happened in Lebanon, is that there's a lot of Muslims who are being - Muslim civilians who are being killed.",
        "This actually cuts the legs right from underneath the Muslim scholars and Muslim Madras who would go to argue against the recruitment of these terrorists that killing innocent civilians is wrong.",
        "It actually (unintelligible) - defeats all their efforts.",
        "And you know about Mike Shire(ph), who has actually been writing in his books and saying in his interviews that the number one cause of terrorism is our unconditional support for Israel.",
        "And the second is about oil and support for states like Saudi Arabia and Egypt and so on.",
        "So unless we really talk about and debate about the cause of terrorism and our government's support for such actions as Lebanon, it is really hurting us, and it's not helping us on war on terrorism.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Tom, thanks very much for your call.",
        "Richard Haass, this calls for a fundamental change in foreign policy.",
        "Well, I think we've got to be selective about it, but let me say where I agree with the caller.",
        "There are aspects of U.S.",
        "or international policy which do help bring about an environment which alienates or radicalizes.",
        "Again, I mentioned Lebanon.",
        "I mentioned the lack of progress, say, on a Palestinian problem.",
        "One thing the United States could usefully do is spell out some of its ideas about what a Palestinian state would look like, how you somehow square commitments to Israel and commitments to Palestinians.",
        "I think that would be helpful.",
        "There might be one other thing we could usefully do right now.",
        "Lebanon has really been destroyed badly.",
        "I believe there ought to be an extremely public U.S.",
        "effort through the Lebanese government to help the people of Lebanon.",
        "We learned in places like Indonesia after the tsunami.",
        "We learned in places like Pakistan after the earthquake that tangible, visible aspects or elements of U.S.",
        "aid - getting relief supplies to innocent men, women, and children - could have a tremendous impact.",
        "People could see the American people and the U.S.",
        "government doing concrete things to help them.",
        "I would suggest that both privately and publicly, we ought to see an overwhelming response from the American people and from the U.S.",
        "government in Lebanon.",
        "Richard Haass, thanks very much for your time today.",
        "We appreciate it."

        "And all of the games this year out of market are going to be only on satellite instead of cable.",
        "So about - I think baseball estimated that 300,000 homes will not be able to watch the games.",
        "Is this such a good deal economically, it's worth the sacrifice of audience?",
        "What baseball is doing is that they're trying to pressure the cable companies into making a better deal, because baseball is launching its own network in 2009.",
        "So what you have here is, you've got a leverage deal.",
        "You've got these two sides trying to force each other to make a favorable deal, and the person who loses, as always, is the consumer, because if you have cable, you can't watch a baseball game unless it's on ESPN or unless it's a game that's already in your market.",
