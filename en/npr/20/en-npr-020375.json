        "So why did the president sound so confident today?",
        "Well, the White House actually has a lot of power on national security and a lot of power at the border.",
        "That authority comes not just from the Constitution but also federal immigration law that allows the president to ban entire classes of people who may be detrimental to American interests.",
        "The problem, Kelly, is that Donald Trump's lawyers argued in court he has a virtual blank check.",
        "Most judges aren't buying it.",
        "They say there has to be some ability to review these executive branch actions.",
        "So in this ruling, this three-judge panel seemed to say Trump's justice department did not present evidence that there is a real national security threat from these travelers, right?",
        "Yeah, the Justice Department did not have much of an answer for whether there are specific cases where travelers or refugees have attacked on American soil.",
        "In fact, today, in a related case in Virginia, a federal judge there said, quote, \"\"the courts have been begging you to provide some evidence, and you're not.\"\" Instead, almost every judge who's considered this travel ban has concluded that travelers - people separated from their families, from their jobs at state universities and hospitals - are the ones suffering real harm here.",

        "Even if the White House makes clear once and for all that green card holders - these legal permanent residents - are not affected by the travel ban, it doesn't fix the problem because thousands of people - we don't know how many because the Justice Department has still not provided a list - were barred from coming into the U.S.",

        "He said they're waiting to see the new executive order, but he thinks there's still likely a basis for a case here.",
        "No ban is directed at one religion or benefits a religion is going to be constitutional in our view.",
        "That's simply antithetical to the First Amendment and equal protection and antithetical to American values.",
