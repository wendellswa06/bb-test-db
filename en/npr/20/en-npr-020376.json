        "I take it four times a day until the bottle was gone.",
        "And it worked.",
        "His red lumps disappeared, so Landry assumed his treatment was complete.",

        "Davis and her colleague, Michael Wolf, of the Northwestern University, say what's needed is better communication, using more precise terms."
