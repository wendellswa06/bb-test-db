        "Recently, since they began talking tough about inflation, these surveys of inflation expectations or the market measures of inflation expectations, have sort of improved a little bit, and the Fed has to decide, well, have we done enough with our rhetoric, or do we have to raise interest rates once or twice more to convince people that we're really not going to let it get out of control?"
