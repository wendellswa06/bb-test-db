        "The crowd is actually quite varied: a lot of pensioners and retirees who are speaking very strongly about Russia, a lot of young guys who look a little bit tough, and as I found out when I came here to Donetsk, a couple of Russians, as well.",
        "These are people who are based in Moscow.",
        "They are Russians.",
        "They live in Russia, and they come over to watch and maybe to give some advice.",

        "It was very sudden.",
        "They're fairly well-organized, and there are a lot of rumors about people being bussed in across the border, as well.",
        "It sort of raises the question, at least, of how much these are being coordinated or inspired by Moscow.",
        "They certainly play very strongly into this idea that Russia needs to come in and protect ethnic Russian minorities from the new government in Kiev.",

        "And he was the person who scaled the building and put the flag up.",
        "And afterwards, he wrote a blog post about it, and he said: I was happy to raise the flag over that building.",
        "This is a person who also has a history of being part of a pro-Kremlin youth group in Russia.",
        "And that image of him raising the flag is another really important part of the narrative for Moscow, in this case.",
        "Otherwise, I mean, during that same protest, a hundred people were beaten in the streets, in the main square of that city, pro-Western demonstrators who were already in the administration building, and they were sort of dragged out and beaten.",
        "If it hadn't been for that flag being raised, you could see this more as a lynch mob, rather than an expression of ethnic Russians asking for Russia to help them.",
        "And I think that a lot of them would just like to be left alone.",
        "I mean, does this tell us that there might not be as much support for Russia as we've come to think so far?",
