        "Greg, let me bring you in because even just today in the USA Today column by Christine Brennan, she interviewed the baseball commissioner Bud Selig and he's talking about trying to suspend A-Rod.",
        "Well, Bud Selig as commissioner has always been, in my opinion, one who goes with the wind.",
        "He should have, if he really wanted to attack or penalize these players, which he cannot do now based on their bargaining - collective bargaining agreement.",
        "He should have done that a few years ago.",

        "He's hearing what's going on with A-Rod, so now he wants to act like he's a commissioner and wants to do something and it's too late.",
        "Not only is he talking about potentially suspending A-Rod, he's talking about going into the Hall of Fame and putting asterisks behind names of everybody who was playing during that time who's numbers could be brought up in a question, Chad.",
        "Yeah, I really don't know what to make about that.",
        "I'm guessing if any more names come out, it would be appropriate to go wholesale on this, but I don't know.",
        "With A-Rod, you might want to look at what he does from here on out, but you have to judge the whole body of work.",
        "So I don't know, it would probably have to be on a case by case basis, but I could definitely see that happening, whether or not I agree it.",
