        "In the past, before I learned about the Ponseti Method, guaranteed, I would've had to - literally - do a surgical operation to take apart and put back together the entire foot.",
        "That surgery usually had to be repeated several times, causing a buildup of scar tissue that can lead to arthritis and pain.",
        "The Ponseti Method, on the other hand, is pretty much painless, with just a small incision to clip a tendon.",
        "And most kids easily adapt to the boots because they start wearing them so early.",
        "The method was developed by Dr. Ignacio Ponseti at the University of Iowa, in the 1950s.",
        "He spent his career tirelessly trying to get other doctors to accept it.",
        "He died in 2009.",
        "Here's Dr. Herzenberg again.",
        "People, you know, were just falling over themselves to do fancy, invasive surgery.",
        "And this one strange, old guy who speaks softly with a Spanish accent, in Iowa, was getting sort of ignored by the drumbeats of the people who were in favor of surgery.",
        "Surgeons are trained to operate, explains Herzenberg, and usually that's the way they make money.",
        "The Ponseti Method brings in a lot less for orthopedists.",
        "So for about 50 years, the technique mostly stayed in Iowa.",
        "But then, something new came along - the Internet.",
        "Clubfoot is a real prototype for how the Internet has changed medicine and how parents have been the driving force, in many ways.",
        "Jennifer Trevillian was one of those parents.",
        "When her daughter was born with clubfoot in 2000, she started researching the condition on her new dial-up connection.",
        "There wasn't much.",
        "But she did find a few other parents talking about another option on iVillage, and a Yahoo support group called NoSurgery4ClubFoot.",
        "A few days later, she was on her way from Michigan to Iowa, to see Dr. Ponseti.",
        "In the amount of time that we would have just been waiting for her to be big enough to tolerate the anesthesia for the reconstructive surgery she was supposed to have, Dr. Ponseti completely corrected her foot.",
        "Trevillian joined the small but growing group of parents evangelizing about the Ponseti Method online.",
        "When you find good treatment, you become passionate about helping other families who are in the same situation."

        "Trevillian built a few websites herself, telling her daughter's story; and she stayed active on the fast-growing Yahoo group.",
        "Other parents started traveling long distances to find a Ponseti practitioner.",
        "The way that the clubfoot treatment pendulum has swung is really a classic example of supply and demand because once parents found out about it, they demanded it for their kids.",
        "And compelled orthopedists to learn how to do it.",
        "Today, the nonsurgical method is almost always the treatment of choice for clubfoot, and it's recommended by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.",
        "It's important to find an expert at the technique because if it's done wrong, the child could end up needing surgery anyway.",
        "But when done correctly, 95 percent of kids born with clubfoot will never need a major surgery.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Jenny Gold.",
        "The civil war in Syria has left four million people dependent on food aid.",
        "That's what Muhannad Hadi, the World Food Program's emergency coordinator for Syria, told us on the program last week, and he expects that number to grow to seven million by the end of this year.",
        "In the same way that we all teach our children about fire safety, to 'stop, drop and roll', it was the first time that we realized we had to do the same type of safety training for our son with regards to what happens when you hear gunshots.",

        "Sitting on the steps in front of his apartment, 14-year-old Trevor Watson says the popping sounds of gunfire sometimes keep him up at night.",
        "To deal with it, he tries to ignore it.",
        "I see stuff like that so often it doesn't even affect me anymore.",
        "But that stoic facade drops when a kid walks into the courtyard in front of Watson's apartment.",
        "He's holding something under his shirt.",
        "Watson leans in and whispers into my producer's microphone."
