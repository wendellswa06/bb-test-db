        "So we know that the EU wants hard limits on migrants.",
        "What does Turkey want from these talks?",
        "Well, they'd like a little more help dealing with all of these people.",
        "I mean, they look at around at 2.7 million Syrians here, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and others, then they look at these 28 countries in the EU with about a third as many migrants, and those countries are saying sorry, no vacancy, go back.",
        "Turks don't find that very realistic nor very in line with the humanitarian traditions Europe's always talking about.",
        "Are there some developments today that make that point?",
        "Well, just today we're hearing Macedonia has declared several cities inside Syria and Iraq to be safe areas, including Damascus and Baghdad, so they won't accept any Syrians or Iraqis from their respective capitals.",

        "For its part, Turkey wouldn't object when Greece sends back Syrians and other migrants across Aegean Sea, and Greece has already started doing that.",
        "So the bottom line seems to be whatever they can do to end this dangerous dash to Europe.",
        "Well, is the European position sort of that these migrants should just stay in Turkey, or do they really expect them to stay in these conflict areas?",
        "I mean, is their point of view realistic?",
        "It doesn't seem sustainable.",
        "I mean, this idea of cities inside Syria being safe is very hard to defend, and in Iraq as well.",
        "And Turkey is not an ideal place because it had unusual asylum rules.",
        "None of these Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans can seek asylum here.",
        "They can stay as guests.",

        "Things are getting tense, and it's just getting more dangerous all around.",
        "Peter, before we let you go, we've focused a lot on Syrians, of course, but what other migrants - Iraqis, Afghans, North Africans?",
        "Well, exactly.",
        "I mean, this kind of resentment as they get shoved to the back of the line really has been popping up - well, since last summer even.",
        "You see fights in camps, and it's usually Afghans or Iraqis grumbling and venting their frustration because Syrians are now being given pride of place.",
        "And that gets to this really difficult question of who's a refugee fleeing danger, and who's an economic migrant just looking for a better life?"

        "It became one of 22 agencies, encompassing everything from the Coast Guard to Disaster Recovery, that were thrown together in response to the terrorist strike.",
        "Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent, says the Services' morale problems can be traced back to that day.",
        "In the 13 years that I was with the Secret Service, there has been a progressive down-slide of morale.",
        "As Secret Service has integrated further into the DHS culture, you have seen a correlation in the decline of morale.",
        "Now, moving an agency from one part of the governmental organizational chart to another might not seem like such a big deal, but the Service was an elite unit when it was part of the relatively small Treasury Department.",
        "And when it became part of the sprawling bureaucracy that is Homeland Security, the Secret Service found itself competing with a lot of other folks, says Wackrow.",
        "We have to fight internally for money and resources against issues of immigration, issues that arise with the Coast Guard and other Homeland Security issues.",
        "So for us to try to have a voice in that sea of confusion, sometimes it's very difficult for our managers.",
        "Like other federal agencies, the department lost part of its funding due to the sequester of the operating budget last year.",
        "Former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano vowed those cuts would not be taken from the protective side of the Services' budget.",
        "In fact Congress gave the Service more money than it asked for last year because lawmakers felt the Obama administration underfunded the agency.",
        "But former Assistant Secret Service Director Mickey Nelson agrees there has been a lot more scrambling for resources since the service became part of Homeland Security.",
        "The Secret Service mission pretty much stayed the same unlike some of the other agencies that were brought over.",
        "Now, what has happened over the period of time of course, you've got quite a few components within DHS fighting for what seems to be an increasingly smaller budget.",

        "Instead, the doubters say it was Ye's dramatic improvement in the personal best time that raises red flags, not however, for Lord Sebastian Coe.",
