        "Istanbul is, after all, one of those places like Rome, Athens, or Jerusalem where this kind of thing tends to happen a lot.",
        "But local frustrations were soon overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of what was being so carefully lifted from the mud along the Sea of Marmara: millions of pottery shards, animal bones - horses, elephants - 60 species in all.",
        "And many other remnants of the booming trade done here in the Middle Ages, when this dog-eared Istanbul neighborhood was the glorious port of Theodosius.",
        "To here, the world's rarities arrived at Constantinople, the eastern flank of the Roman Empire.",
        "For archaeologist Ufuk Kocabas, from Istanbul University, it's the find of a lifetime.",

        "I can say, you know, their protection status, wonderful.",
        "With the transit projects back on track behind him after years of delay, Kocabas shows the visitors the timbers from the Byzantine vessels, now resting in huge tanks where freshwater is slowly circulating, leaching the salt from the ancient wood.",
        "It's a process that will take years, during which time Kocabas says the wood must be protected from new enemies, such as bacteria and mosquito larvae.",
        "That's why we are adding some biocides inside.",
        "Also, we are using goldfish.",
        "They are really efficient to larvae of mosquito.",

        "The Istanbul Archaeological Museum is in overall charge of the project, with Kocabas and his colleagues taking care of the ships.",
        "They range from small cargo boats to mighty Byzantine naval vessels that helped break two Arab sieges and repelled other would-be conquerors.",
        "Yeah, in that time, their navy was really strong because they invented Greek fire; a kind of - how can I say - fire bomb, you know?",
        "And it was a secret."
