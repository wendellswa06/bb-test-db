        "Now, California and New York are states that at times have really been concerned about these negotiations, in part because they're saying that the banks could potentially get too much immunity in exchange for this deal.",
        "And is that still an issue here?",
        "Yes, but that difference is narrowing and banks would still get pretty broad immunity with the settlement.",
        "If all the states sign on, banks will not face suits about how they originated these loans - any sort of subprime or predatory lending practices.",
        "And also, this would cover them against any suits regarding that robo-signing issue, where mortgage companies signed false affidavits in order to speed up the foreclosure process, which was what started this whole process in the first place.",
        "OK, Yuki.",

        "A lot of these states weren't happy with the entire process.",
        "They said they wanted to do full investigations to gauge the full extent of the possible fraud, before even starting negotiating a settlement.",
        "But now they worry that the settlement could tie their hands.",
        "Some have cases pending against the banks already, under various state laws, and they want to make sure this doesn't shortchange that.",
        "California is, of course, big and they have a lot of clout.",
        "And right now, that state is pushing for more ability to enforce the provisions in this settlement.",
        "At root, if you had to boil it down, the criticism of this settlement is this: It doesn't demand a structural change in how the banks handle troubled mortgages.",
        "And banks will still get to call a lot of the shots.",
        "So then, is the settlement actually expected to solve the country's mortgage problems in any way?"
