        "Well, this was story I think the people really had forgotten.",
        "No one really remembers how Margaret Mitchell died, I think.",
        "And the initial response was sort of horror.",
        "Here was a guy, it turned out, who was a taxi driver who had 22 previous arrests for driving violations - speeding, drunk driving, various things like that, and he had never gone to jail.",
        "He'd only been fined.",
        "So he basically was given slaps on the wrist.",
        "And then one night, when Margaret Mitchell and her husband crossed the street, here he came speeding on the wrong side of the road and hit and killed Margaret Mitchell, and the initial response of the public was horror, but then, interestingly over time, things shifted and there started to be more sympathy for the driver than Margaret Mitchell.",
        "How did that happen?",
        "Why did the public sympathy turn, do you think?",
        "Talks between the producers' league and the stagehands' union broke off late last night.",
        "They had spent all day Saturday and Sunday talking when producers told the union that its offer wasn't, quote, \"\"good enough.\"\" No further talks had been scheduled, so the League of American Theaters and Producers announced it's canceling this week's performances.",
        "I'm going to fan them out so that you can see I did not palm the card out.",
        "Commentator Julie Zickefoose rescues birds in distress as a licensed wildlife rehabilitator, and that may seem like a low-tech pastime.",
        "Here's her story of what happened when a pair of wrens met one of the most popular high-tech gadgets.",
        "When a cascade of twigs, leaves and rootlets appeared on the elbow of our downspout, I watched to see a little brown wren trying to make a great wad of nesting materials stay on the slippery metal.",
        "I caught the bird's eye.",
        "Wait right here.",
        "I'm going to help you.",
        "I ran to the garage, grabbed a little copper bucket, some wire and a step ladder.",
        "I climbed the ladder, wired the bucket up under the eave, placed the nesting material in the little pale, and climbed down the ladder.",
        "The wren perched on the gutter, just a few feet away, watching.",
        "Before I got the ladder folded, the wren appeared with a bill full of moss and put it in its new home.",
        "By nightfall, the nest was nearly complete.",
        "Since that day five years ago, 30 or more baby Carolina wrens have been raised in the copper pale.",
        "And we've watched the fledglings flutter out time and time again, adding motion and music to our lives.",
        "There were five nestlings this summer, and they lined up on the downspout before making their first stuttering flights into the world - well, four of them did.",
        "When Carolina wrens leave the nest, they don't mess around.",
        "One minute, everything's quiet.",
        "The next minute, baby birds are shooting out of the nest like popcorn.",
        "The parent birds work in shifts, calling and encouraging the young to hop and flutter to the nearest deep cover.",
        "Somehow, the adult birds keep them all together and feed them for the next three weeks as their wings strengthen and foraging skills develop.",
        "So I was alarmed to find one baby wren, all bright eyes and yellow clown lips, still perched by the bucket after its four siblings had gained the safety of the woods.",
        "Surely, a parent would return for it.",
        "One hour, then two went by, and the fledgling was hungry, chirping constantly for help.",
        "Oh, dear.",
        "I did not want to be a teenage wren's mother for the next three weeks.",
        "I listened - nothing from the silent woods.",
        "By now, the family could be hundreds of yards away.",
        "What to do?",
        "It was time for a little technology.",
        "I grabbed my iPod, which is fully loaded with the songs and calls of nearly every North American bird.",
        "I ran to edge of our woods and dialed up the song of the Carolina wren.",
        "Please, please, let this work.",
        "I played it at full volume -no response.",
        "Desperate, I dialed up the alarm call of the wren and blasted it down into the silent tangle of raspberry and sumac.",
        "Danger, danger the recording shrilled in wren-speak.",
        "An adult wren shot right past my head, flying straight toward the forgotten baby in the copper bucket.",
        "The recalcitrant fledgling buzzed out to meet it."

        "What I saw was a generation of Garifuna people who no longer knew how to speak our language, in such a way that nobody under the age of 50 was able to communicate with me in our language.",
        "And music, being the thing that I love most, I decided to use music as a medium for culture preservation.",
        "At least, we'd be able to use the language in songs and keep them alive.",

        "For years and years, back in that era, people who were killed or victimized by a drunk driver were seen as being in the wrong place at the wrong time - that these things happen.",
        "And that was very much the case with Margaret Mitchell.",
        "After the initial sort of outrage, people started to say, well, it was her time to go.",
        "I read so many stories like that and every one was almost more shocking than the next - that we could have had a society that was so passive to a crime that was killing 25,000 people a year for so long."

        "And how much of a shift has there been since then, do you think?",
        "We're down to about 10 or 11,000 alcohol-related deaths a year in crashes, from 25,000.",
        "So there's been a lot of progress, and I wouldn't want to minimize that at all.",
        "But I saw a recent statistic put out by the CDC that suggested that there are at least 110 million instances of drunk driving in this country still a year.",

        "There are lots of forces in this country that don't want to see the blood alcohol level dropped further for safe driving.",
        "So I am thinking about technologies that can help.",
        "Breathalyzers that are installed in cars, they're known as ignition interlocks, that you have to breathe into before your car can start.",
        "Many states are using those for people who have multiple DWI convictions, and some states are using them for people with only one.",
        "I would be much more in favor of those becoming widespread.",
        "And then the next possibility, although this is gonna generate a lot opposition from the Libertarian types, is a technology - an infrared technology that would allow people's blood alcohol levels to be determined once they put their hands on the steering wheel.",
        "And if there was an alcohol level, the car would stop, or would not be able to start.",
        "That's something that will be very tough to both fund in this country, and to get across politically, but to my mind, when I want to drive home at night, I don't people driving in my direction that have been drinking.",
        "Have you changed your own patterns of driving and drinking, if you do, after doing this book?",
        "Well, I was never much of a drinker, you know, it's nice to have a drink or two at a party, but there's ways you can do it more safely than other ways, and one thing you can do is when you get to the party, and you have a drink or two and then you have dinner, is to stop drinking at that point.",
        "And indeed, if you have enough food in your stomach and you're drinking relatively early in the evening, by the time you get in your car, your blood alcohol level is going to be extremely low, and it's gonna be legal.",
        "I think where people run into trouble is they either don't eat or they continue to drink all night and then they decide to get in their car.",
        "I think we're never gonna get to a point in this country where people are gonna say, you know what, I'm not gonna drink and drive.",
        "I think we need to get people to do so in a manner that is safe and reflects the scientific knowledge about what we know.",
        "And then, of course, the other thing is designated drivers.",
        "I mean, the fact is, other countries use designated drivers incredibly enthusiastically, and we still sort of look down on it, and people aren't willing to go to a party and be the designated driver because they think they can't enjoy themselves and that's really a pity."
