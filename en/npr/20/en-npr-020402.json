        "Is it fairly easy for you to do that or do you sort of struggle with ideas and expressions that might not always translate back and forth?",
        "I don't translate to English when I write.",
        "So I write I start with English.",
        "It's often harder, I think, when I speak because then I have to be, you know, on the fly, so to speak.",

        "But I think, you know, this is partly what this story is about and not the narrator's character but Vuk's character.",
        "Even the piece itself, there's something kind of sharp about the tone that I don't have in my speaking voice but I do have in my writing, and it's kind of a desire to have sort of seamless language."
