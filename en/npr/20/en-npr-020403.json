        "And he said, oh yes, yes.",

        "And they said, if anybody would know, there's a guy here named Snaky Davis(ph).",
        "That's Dai Vernon.",
        "He was nearly 90 years old when he talked to a group of magicians about his quest in this 1982 interview.",

        "Three years ago, the court said police must wait 15 to 20 seconds.",
        "But yesterday, a bitterly divided court ruled that if police violate that rule without a good reason, the traditional penalty of disallowing the seized evidence at trial will not apply.",
        "The evidence can come in.",
        "The five-to-four decision seems to signal a new aggressiveness by the court's conservative majority, a majority now enhanced by two new Bush appointees, and it illustrates the pivotal role of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who joined the majority but wrote separately to say that he would not go along with any wholesale abandonment of the century-old rule that bars illegally obtained evidence from being used at trial.",

        "I think you certainly can.",
