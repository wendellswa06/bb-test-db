        "But the title was so captivating.",
        "I heard in, I guess it was 1996, when he first said it, and just thought this, this has to be a piece of music.",
        "That famous expression of Mr. Greenspan's was used, at the time, to suggest the tech stock boom of the '90s...",
        "Right.",
        "...was possibly a bubble.",
        "Were you thinking bubble?",
        "I, I think I was.",
        "I think the kind of mentality that he was trying to describe of a whole society of people blithely investing themselves in something that might be very short-lived seemed to kind of capture a sort of spirit that I might want to express into music.",

        "Not so much, you know, there was an article that suggested that the second section was the gloom that came afterwards.",
        "I didn't really intend gloom at all in the piece.",
        "We, of course, know Greenspan for the famous Greenspan-speak.",
        "Of course, he's thinking in numbers, and he's thinking in terms of the economy as a fairly cold thing that he's meant to analyze.",
        "Well, of course, numbers and music are related.",
        "Maybe not the hard, cold numbers of the stock market.",
        "But proportions and relations, certainly, and even in rhythm.",
        "And that's very much a mathematical aspect of music.",
        "Life Delirious is the last of the five sections of this overture.",
        "This section was supposed to have water-like images, waves.",
        "And then it ends in the state of mind well before the 2001 crash.",
        "Not to press this, the analogy, but there it sounds like, something like an opening bell, or an opening triangle.",
        "Could be opening bell, or a very, closing bell on a great day.",
        "Thank you, Robert Pound for talking to us about your piece of music."
