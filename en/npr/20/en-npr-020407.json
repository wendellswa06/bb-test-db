        "And the point that he made was this, someone had it in personally for A-Rod because A-Rod's name was the only one of these 104 that was released, and that the 103 others on that list are probably shaking in their boots.",
        "Yeah, I could see that and really in terms of the case of A-Rod, perhaps that person who released it is probably a Yankees fan, and you know how some Yankees fans are that it's a privilege to wear pin stripes, and he's making a $252 million and he hasn't produced a thing for us.",
        "And not only he's gotten traded to the Yankees, he also got a second contract out of the Yankees when he became a free agent last year so, and he's been kind of fraudulent.",

        "I mean, I listened to the press conference yesterday and I really heard a man who is at peace with his decision.",
