        "What about...",
        "That's my opinion.",
        "All right, now one foot - one other football note up in your area, Greg, what about Matt Cassel, where is he going to be?",
        "Well, the Patriots, they hold the ball, they really want to see what's the mark out there for Matt Cassel and also keep him as a - insurance just in case Tom Brady won't be able to make it back from the preps at the beginning of the season and hold on to Cassel.",
        "But at the same time, if they do keep Cassel, that's $29 million tied into two players on - at the same position and that's not the Patriot's way.",
        "So I think they're giving themselves some time to look at the market and see if they can get a first round - first and third round pick, maybe a first or the second round pick.",
        "But they could deal or could just sit tight and see, making sure that Tom Brady's ready to go next year.",
        "All right, let's talk about basketball for a moment, and before we get to the NBA All Star game that's coming up, here's a story that's really still developing here in Los Angeles involving NBA Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor who was with the Lakers all those years, but for the last two decades has been in the front office of the woeful Los Angeles Clippers.",
        "And now he is suing them, claiming that they had racist attitudes toward players, and that they mistreated him, and there's some disagreement, I suppose would be an understatement to say, over his compensation in terms of how he left.",
        "This is sort of a sad thing to hear, isn't it, Chad?",
        "It absolutely is.",
        "You're talking about a guy named Elgin Baylor who really gave his heart and soul to the Clippers, a floundering team with the exception of the 2006 season where they ended up going - where they end up going to the playoffs almost to the Western conference finals.",
        "But it's a shame.",
        "There's no other way to know about it.",
        "I just heard about it this afternoon.",
        "But it doesn't sound good.",
        "Well, one of the things that the Clipper organization says, well, look, you know, we had a losing team for 22 years and we kept him so that ought to say something about whether or not we were discriminatory, Greg.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, I would say this, if he was beat - the one thing that he should understand, he worked for Donald Sterling who for years had made a lot of money being cheap with the Clippers.",
        "He didn't care about the product that was out there, and one of the things about his products that was - that was cheap was his GM.",
        "He was paying his GM $350,000 and if Elgin Baylor thought that he was being mistreated, well, I would have left after 10 years or 15 years because a lot of his colleagues are making way more than $350,000.",
        "So if he was really feeling that bad about it - but he should have left, at the same time, he should also realize who his owner is, Donald Sterling, so...",
        "True."

        "Well, I guess you got a point there.",
        "And speaking of people being unhappy, there are a lot of people in the NBA right now who feel that they should be in Phoenix, Arizona playing in that game on Sunday, and they are not going to be there because they were not selected, not elected by the fans nor selected by the coaches to be on the team.",
        "What do you think of this, Chad?",
        "Who's the angriest, and who has the best case?",

        "Well, the one thing that - until a couple of injuries happened, the biggest one, the biggest problem was the Cleveland Cavaliers until this - until a couple of days ago, only had one representative and they have one of the best records in the league this year.",
        "They only had until two days ago, LeBron James representing the Cavaliers and now they had more wins, before it was only him, and then the Orlando Magic who is just really coming up this year got three candidates on there.",
        "But then there's Danny Granger who was selected on the team ahead of Mo Williams, who is having an excellent season averaging over 25 points a game, but the problem is he's in a losing team.",
        "So there's always going to be snubs in any type of All Star selection, you know, football, baseball, basketball and - you know, Carmelo Anthony's not even in the All Star game.",
        "He was hurt for, you know, about 10 games..."

        "I think Kobe looks like he - Kobe and the Lakers look like they're on the way to do it, and unlike Shaq, you know, you're doing well down in Phoenix but let's see if you can - you and Nash can get along on the court.",

        "Yeah, I mean, Shaq, you know, Kobe does really recognize that Shaq helped him to get three titles and Shaq got another title on his own without Kobe, but at the end of the day, both of them realized that they missed out on opportunities to do something special and - you know, when you're a little bit younger, you're a little bit immature and then when you get old and wiser, you reflect on things that would've - could have happened.",
        "So that's what it's about, not what it is about right now, is that they're reflecting that they could have had six or seven titles end of the day if they would've stayed together.",
        "Now with even all that bickering, three straight championships is nothing to sneeze at.",
        "No, it's nothing to sneeze at at all and Kobe, he is dying to have another championship which he liked to have without Shaq just to show that he was right with what he was saying before.",
