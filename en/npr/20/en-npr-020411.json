        "The California Board of Education was lobbied by Hindu activist groups who claim that the real story of Hinduism isn't told in history textbooks.",

        "He says it would be a mistake to look at ancient Indian society through the prism of modern concerns.",
        "To read modern concerns of inequality and equality into ancient society is not advisable, because it distorts the study of our ancient society, their value systems, and their worldview.",
        "This kind of debate isn't new.",
        "School boards in California and elsewhere have become embroiled in similar controversies over history instruction as it relates to various ethnic, religious, and cultural groups."

        "Which actually brings me to my next question - how equipped do you think this administration is?",
        "That is what I'm very worried about.",
        "The real risk, as I see it right now, is that we will have a badly mismanaged recession because, right now, this administration has made pretty clear that it doesn't have a plan.",
        "It never had a plan.",
        "In fact, colleagues of mine from The Washington Post on the news side - I'm on the opinion side to clarify - reported earlier this week that administration officials have done no planning for any possible recession because they don't want to feed a negative narrative.",

        "Historically, going back to about the early '90s, the executive branch, the White House in particular, has made a concerted effort to never comment on monetary policy because you need the central bank to be independent both in practice and in perception in order for its actions to be credible.",
        "And if people start questioning whether the Fed is making choices about interest rates, that undermines their ability to make those decisions and for those decisions to have their intended effect.",

        "For example, he says, 50 years ago, a history of the west would probably say nothing about women, Latinos, or environmental degradation.",
        "Now, Starr says, as newer groups assert themselves, they will make demands the state school board will have to negotiate.",

        "The dispute over how Hinduism will be depicted is now in the hands of a sub-committee of the State Board of Education, which is withholding comment until this controversy is resolved.",
