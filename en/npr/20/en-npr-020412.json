        "Nobody--many people wouldn't even bother going to the police because it was extra headache.",

        "No, I mean, I think like everybody else, when I first approached the story, I wondered why things happened the way they happened.",
        "And the more time I spent on that farm and the more time I spent talking to people who were there that night, the more clear it became that there really wasn't any other option here.",

        "And he said no. You know, decision, in fact, is the wrong word, that it's not like he had an array of options in front of him, and he picked this one.",
        "This was the only way out.",
        "Well, why couldn't, some would say - why couldn't the sheriff's office have fired tranquilizer darts and captured these animals?",
        "I understand that question, and again, I had the same notion as I drove to Zanesville.",
        "First of all, nobody has, on hand, no small-town sheriff's department, is going to have enough tranquilizer to put down 50 animals.",
        "The other thing I think is that, maybe from film or I'm not sure why exactly, but people think you shoot a dart into an animal, and it falls asleep.",
        "Tranquilizers are very tricky to use.",
        "Darts don't behave like bullets.",
        "You need different amounts of tranquilizer depending on the animal, depending on the size of the animal, depending on whether the animal has eaten recently.",
        "If you give them too much tranquilizer, you kill them; if you give them not enough, you enrage them.",
        "And on top of all of that, it still takes 10 or 15 minutes for the animal to fall asleep.",
        "And when the sheriff arrived - I mean, these animals were leaving the farm.",
        "I think sometimes people think that they were sort of in their cages still.",
        "They were out of the fence and going down the road.",
        "And we played a clip at the beginning of the program from Jay Lawhorn(ph), a former Marine who participated, he's a sheriff's deputy, and witnessed a veterinarian fire a dart at the last of the tigers to be alive, and they hoped that that tiger could be saved.",
        "Exactly, yeah.",
        "The following morning, the day after the bulk of the incident, they found one more tiger in the woods.",
        "And they called in a vet, and she fired the tranquilizer and did everything correctly, and it was one of those moments - in a lot of ways, the story is very cinematic.",
        "She fires the tranquilizer.",
        "She stays very still.",
        "Someone who is with her, one of the officers or one of the caretakers, said you got him, I saw you got him because he jolted.",
        "And as soon as that voice rang out through the trees, the tiger got up and charged.",
        "And the vet was caught in thorns.",
        "She's trying to back away, and they ended up shooting that tiger, as well.",
        "And these were - there were many encounters - not just with that veterinarian - but many encounters of people, neighbors, who all of a sudden noticed a lion in the yard."

        "And I think people, sort of, smiled at it in some ways.",
        "But when you actually go to that farm, and you actually talk to the neighbors or the officers who were there, I mean, it was a terrifying night.",
        "I mean, the way I put it to people is you can imagine in D.C., for instance, if one tiger was loose what kind of story that would be.",
        "And here in Zanesville, just because it's a small town, but there are 50 animals on the loose, 18 tigers, 17 lions.",

        "It's just one of those unreal stories.",
        "And again, the impression some people may have had was this was a bunch of small-town sheriff's deputies, off on a safari, having a great time.",
        "Yeah, oh for sure, and the officers were very clear, like, they have heard that.",
        "You know, the day after this incident, the dispatchers said they received a constant barrage of calls.",
        "I talked to one dispatcher who worked an eight-hour shift, and she said in that time, the phone never stopped ringing, and only once was it a call for help.",
        "Every other call was someone either from somewhere else in the States or overseas, England, Australia, just screaming invective at them, that they should be shot, that why had they destroyed these animals.",
        "They were very - either all these officers were incredibly good actors with me, or they really, really did not enjoy what happened that night.",
        "You know, several of them told me it was the worst call of their life.",
        "They described scenes - Sergeant Steve Blake(ph), one of the officers talked about seeing a tiger caught in the headlights of his truck, and one minute it's standing there, and then the officers in the back of the truck shoot, and this patch of fur, like a leaf of paper, just blows off its back.",
        "And for an instant there, he could see the tiger's spine in his headlights.",
        "He could see the white of its spine.",
        "And he said, you know, as you would, he said I've just never seen anything like it in my life.",
        "And he's - in particular he's a guy who really loves animals.",
        "And he said these are just such beautiful animals.",
        "You know, you see a tiger in the headlights of your truck, it stops you, but - and then when it falls down, after it's been shot, it stops you again.",
        "There was one incident, a group of local - I think it's fair to call them idiots - poker players who decided to go out and rustle up a trophy."
