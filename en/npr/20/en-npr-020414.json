        "And you're probably asking the question, real quick - I know – you can get another caller here if you want to - why were the animals laid out up there?",
        "Because if you read the stories that have been written, that are correct, the animals are laid out because you're getting different numbers.",
        "Someone said there were only 15 tigers - I think it was 19.",
        "I don't have my numbers in front of me.",
        "There were only 10 lions.",
        "Well, they're more than that.",
        "In other words, we were getting numbers up there where animals were still out there, see.",
        "So what are we to do?",
        "That's why we had to keep them out there.",
        "Even somebody came up there that night and tried to steal the body of one of the lions, by the way, that was already shot.",
        "And that's why we had to, you know, shut the whole thing down up there.",
        "And that's when the sheriff and I decided we're going to dig a hole 40 feet deep and put those animals there."
