        "I can only give you the best information that I have, and that's my understanding.",

        "David, good to see in person.",

        "They are.",
        "They're not crazy about it in some ways.",
        "Some are saying - some of the organizers in particular say that at least it's bringing some attention to the issue and to some of the events that they have going on.",
        "In fact, one of the organizers I talked to said that the more that this Infrastructure Week joke goes around, the more people signed up to participate in some of the real Infrastructure Week events, the more groups that got engaged to participate elsewhere around the country, not just here in Washington, D.C.",
        "So they do feel like there's a little bit more momentum behind the issue to some degree, but some also worry that the joke kind of lessens the urgency to address real infrastructure need.",
        "And, honestly, this is an urgency we've been hearing about for years, long before President Trump.",
        "What are some of the biggest needs that the industry leaders you're talking to point to?",
        "If they do take the money, they will stand far distance from you - stretch their hand.",
        "Well, the American Society of Civil Engineers rates overall our infrastructure a D-plus and says it will cost $2 trillion more than we have allocated to fix and get everything up to snuff, up to just a passing grade or an average grade level.",
        "So we're not even talking about the best airports in the world.",
        "We're just talking about a bridge that won't collapse.",
        "Right - 55,000 structurally deficient bridges around the country.",
        "We have all kinds of crowded airports.",
        "Water systems are in bad shape.",
        "In fact, there are several boil water orders every day in this country because there's been some contamination in the system.",
        "You look at the locks and dams on the Mississippi.",
        "We could go on and on.",
        "There are all kinds of decrepit conditions, roads that are tearing up tires and trucking companies that go through tires and other equipment more quickly than they used to just because the roads are tearing them up.",
        "It's pretty abysmal out there."

        "We've heard President Trump talk about these problems a fair amount.",
        "Has the administration actually done much to address them?",
        "Well, they haven't done much.",
        "I mean, the president did promise an infrastructure bill within his first 100 days in office.",
        "It took over a year for him to introduce an infrastructure funding plan, and that's gone nowhere in Congress - just did not have enough federal funding, and it didn't identify a funding source for it at all.",
        "There was an omnibus spending bill that included about $20 billion for infrastructure, which was a lot better than many people expected.",
        "But to be clear, that was a move that Congress made, and it overrode some of the budget cuts that the president was proposing.",

        "A lot of frustration.",
        "I mean, mayors are upset because they've gone to their taxpayers and raised local taxes to fund infrastructure projects.",
        "State leaders have done the same.",
        "We're now at 30 or more states that have raised their own gas taxes to better fund infrastructure needs to fix their roads and bridges.",
        "But they need federal help.",

        "Thank you, gentlemen, so much for joining us.",

        "We've got US consumer prices--a one month jump.",
        "It's the highest in 14 years.",
        "Is the US economy going to hell in a handbasket, as my grandmother would say, Greg Price?",
        "Probably not.",
        "Let me just give you historical perspective on this here.",
        "In 1992, after Hurricane Andrew, also in September, the following month jobs fell by 100,000, but then in October they increased again by 173,000 jobs.",
        "So by historical standards, the US economy seems to have a strong resilience in recovering from these natural disasters.",
        "So if the past is a guide to the future, I would say that, no, we're probably not going to hell in a handbasket overall.",
        "Bernard?",
        "I think that the economic performance in recent months has been mixed, and it does appear to be worsening.",
        "The Gross Domestic Product is growing at about 3 percent.",
        "The September employment report showed a decline of 35,000 jobs, but the two previous months showed an increase of about 240,000 jobs.",
        "The budget deficit is worsening; it's now nearly $600 million.",
        "Productivity is slowing.",
        "The trade deficit is worsening, mainly because of the increase in oil prices.",
        "And consumer spending, while still high, appears to--beginning to decline.",
        "And the Federal Reserve is continuing to raise interest rates.",
        "And so when I look at the statistics, I conclude that the economic picture is very mixed, but it does appear to be worsening.",
        "So, Bernard, just to follow up, it sounds like what you just painted a picture of is a broad look at many different factors.",
        "And if the US economy is slowing--put it in terms of labor.",
        "You were assistant secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.",
        "What is this going to mean for jobs, particularly for people who don't have, say, a lot of skills?",
        "Some of the people who were displaced by Katrina, for example, don't necessarily have college educations and won't be able to make their skills portable to some new communities that they've moved into.",
        "Ellis herself never got sick.",
        "She's long past the 21 days it takes to know if someone exposed to an Ebola patient has contracted the disease themselves.",
        "But now she's facing fear and rejection.",
        "Her neighbors want nothing to do with her.",
        "If you say Ebola, everybody will run.",
        "The Flip star certainly burned brightly, but it was more like flash paper.",
        "I have long said, Farai, that African-Americans have a relationship with the economy like the caboose on the train.",
        "When the train speeds up, the caboose speeds up.",
        "When the train slows down, the caboose slows down.",
        "And in the natural order of things, the caboose never catches up with the engine, and so it is.",
        "The unemployment rate of African-Americans increased over the past year, but so did the unemployment rate of whites.",
        "The rate of unemployment continues to be twice in the African-American community than in the white community.",
        "That is a persistent disparity that we've seen for many, many years, and it isn't getting any better.",
        "The black youth unemployment rate today is 32 percent.",
        "And so to the extent that economic performance moves in the direction of slowing down, it means hard times for African-Americans, in particular, in the immediate months ahead."

        "And, Greg, let me follow up with you.",
        "What do you find--you're director of the Mississippi Urban Research Center.",
        "Mississippi, of course, has some of the same mixes of issues with fallout from Katrina and also issues of high-skilled work being hard to find.",
        "What are you finding in your work as director of the center?",
        "Well, just to follow up on what Bernard said about the case of African-Americans, the southern part of Mississippi, of course, was--we were hit pretty hard by Katrina.",
        "And if you look at--going back to the national picture, if you look at the job losses, the biggest component of job losses were in the leisure and hospitality industry.",
        "It fell by 120,000 nationally.",
        "In southern Mississippi, a disproportionate amount of the employment is in tourism-leisure, and it's fair to assume that typically minorities, black Americans, are disproportionately employed in those industries.",
        "So the unemployment affects down in southern Mississippi and along the Gulf Coast are going to be disproportionately borne by black Americans.",
        "There's no doubt about that.",
        "So we're going to see large--higher levels of unemployment.",
        "To the extent that these workers were in low-wage jobs, a lot of minorities in that area will probably be pushed into poverty as a result of job loss.",
        "Let me ask you something that...",
        "I should add, though, that one of the industries in which employment did increase last month is health care.",
        "I think the increase was about 40,000 jobs, and that is an industry in which a significant number of African-Americans, especially those in urban areas, have jobs, albeit somewhat low-paying jobs.",
        "Well, let me just follow up on one thing with you, Greg.",
        "You were just talking about the leisure and hospitality industries in Mississippi really taking a hit as a result of Katrina.",
        "Are you finding in Mississippi that it's similar to New Orleans in that people have just moved other places who were displaced, or are people really sticking around in Mississippi trying to find whatever jobs are left?",
        "Well, yeah, here in the Jackson area we've seen a large influx of evacuees.",
        "But, you know, down on the coast, particularly in areas like Waveland, I mean, the place was just devastated, so it's going to be a while before large sections of the population moves back.",
        "I mean, there are FEMA trailers down there, but it's going to take a while to recover, to rebuild.",
        "I mean, the southern coast of Mississippi was hit pretty bad.",
        "The infrastructure was just wiped out--roads.",
        "A lot of the casinos were basically literally destroyed.",
        "It looks like a nuclear attack down there, essentially.",
        "So it will be a while.",
        "It'll take a while.",
        "And the labor market effects are going to be quite significant for those individuals who were typically employed in those sectors.",
        "Bernard, let me go back to you.",
        "We're talking about the labor issues.",
        "We've been framing it in the (technical difficulties), you know.",
        "But now I want to really broaden it out.",
        "You were talking earlier, really, about the big picture of the economy.",
        "What is it going to take, given that the economy seems in some ways to be slowing down, to ensure that not just people displaced by Katrina but many of America's low-skill, low-wage workers have something to do?",
        "There is this persistent unemployment you were really talking about, some of the high unemployment rates, particularly among African-American youth.",
        "What is it going to take to really put folks to work who may not have the same pathways to success as people who are more educated?",
        "One of the things we must understand is that there is a structural transformation taking place in the American economy.",
        "We have seen over the past decade and even beyond that a continuing decline in manufacturing jobs.",
        "We have seen a continuing outflow of American jobs to countries overseas through the phenomenon of outsourcing.",
        "What we see is that the United States is becoming a country where the heavy concentration on employment is in the high-value-added jobs.",
        "And there is also a rapid expansion of jobs in the services sector, many of which don't pay very high wages.",
        "If there is one solution to the problem of the economic disparity that African-Americans face, it is to improve their investment in human capital, as Greg will understand; that we need to improve the capacity and the income earning capacity of the African-American work force.",
        "That means getting an education, acquiring skills and being able to take advantage of the expanding jobs, most of which will be higher-skilled jobs in the American economy.",
        "So Greg,, what then do you expect the government to do?",
        "Let's put it in this perspective.",
        "If you have a bunch of folks, not just African-Americans but millions of Americans, who don't have a lot of skills, what resources from the government are being marshaled to do job training, to improve the state of education in America?",
        "Or because of the costs that the US government is now facing from Iraq, from the hurricanes, are we going to scale back on some of our efforts to try to turn low-skill workers into high-skill workers?"

        "But I must say that the Democrats haven't offered any credible alternative policy solutions either.",
