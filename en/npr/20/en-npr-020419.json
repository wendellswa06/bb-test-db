        "Thankfully, there seems to be very few human casualties.",

        "It came ashore on the eastern coast of India, in Orissa, near the border with Andhra Pradesh.",
        "And ripped trees up, knocked over power lines, telephone, you know, mobile telephone towers, vehicles were knocked over, including some container lorries that were just tipped on their side, even though they were completely stationary.",

        "But at the moment, the signs are that there aren't too many fatalities.",
        "You mentioned that evacuation - 800,000 people the Indian government removed from that threatened area, which is a huge undertaking.",
        "Was the evacuation considered a success?",
        "I think it was.",
        "Certainly, the state government and the Indian central government are saying it was a success.",
        "There was a very bad storm in 1999 and about 10,000 people were killed in that.",
        "And after that, they did set up some storm shelters and also they were able to move people into solid buildings, such as schools and temples and so on, because a lot of people live in pretty primitive housing in rural areas with very weak roofs, you know, houses made of mud.",
        "So, it looks as though most people have moved into safety before the storm struck.",
        "But there's a lot of damage to electricity supplies and roads and so on.",
        "And it'll take some time before a real full assessment can be done, I think.",
        "But you mentioned that 1999 storm.",
        "The government learned some lessons there?",
        "Yes, I think so.",

        "In the old days, it was just very hard to make contact with remote areas by landline.",
        "And now almost everybody has a mobile phone.",
        "And the air system is better, the road system is better.",
        "So, I think that, you know, the better infrastructure plus the predictions that the storm was coming and the preparations that were made meant that the human damage, at least, was not as severe as it was back then."
