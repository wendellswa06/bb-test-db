        "Well, first of all, this was three drivers who got connected with a plaintiff's attorney.",
        "I think if you talk to the vast, vast majority of Uber drivers, they like the classification because it gives them maximum flexibility not just day-to-day and hour-to-hour, but they can sign up and do this for three months when they're home from school or when they've lost some hours.",
        "And then if they decide to stop doing it, they can stop doing it.",
        "So we're very confident in the legal case.",

        "If the jury does side with these drivers in this case, is Uber prepared?",

        "Well, first of all, I'm not going to speculate.",
        "We're just very confident in the legal case and our business model.",
        "If you compare it to other cases in this space - very clear.",
        "I mean, Fortune magazine did an analysis of this case and estimated that, you know, if these drivers were classified as employees, it would cost Uber upwards of $4 billion to pay the benefits that they're asking for.",
        "I mean, is Uber prepared for that kind of cost?",
        "Well, again, you can ask it many different ways, but I'm just not going to engage in speculation because we're very confident in the case.",

        "If they lose that schedule flexibility and we say, our busiest time is bar closing time, so you need to be out, you know, between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m., that's going to take that opportunity from a lot of people.",
        "I mean, let's game this out.",
        "Let's think about this in the future.",
        "If this kind of work expands, you'll have all these independent contractors out there in the economy and companies less and less responsible to pay for their benefits.",
        "So then who is responsible to pay for them?",
        "I mean, are we really in a climate right now where people want to see the government spending more money on social programs?",
        "Well, it's an interesting question.",
        "I think we should be careful not to accelerate this trend prematurely, meaning, if you have, 10 years from now, a lot more people, let's say, not having traditional employer-employee relationships, then of course policymakers need to step back and say, how do we need to adjust for that?",
        "I mean, truthfully, our model is largely based on people in an employee-employer relationship, working for one company for a very long time.",
        "Obviously our economy's changed well before platforms like Uber.",
        "So I think that's an interesting question, and I think that's a debate for policymakers to engage in.",
        "And we'll certainly be involved in it.",
        "David Plouffe is a board member at Uber and also the company's chief advisor.",
