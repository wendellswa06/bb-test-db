        "There's one brief hospitalization, but no really serious life-threatening illnesses.",

        "The 1976 strain of swine flu was undoubtedly different.",
        "I mean, even though they're both being called swine flu, you know, one of the things that we have to really keep in mind about influenza viruses is that they constantly change.",
        "And so a 1976 virus is just bound to be real different from the one today, genetically in the kind of disease it causes and doesn't cause and so on.",
        "So if this is new, then the protections afforded by those flu vaccines that we all took last winter, they would not necessarily protect us.",
        "No.",
        "They're saying now that the current seasonal flu vaccine shouldn't be relied on to protect anybody.",

        "That's the way flu viruses are typed.",
        "And, in fact, the current seasonal vaccine flu contains a component against an H1M1, but it's - this one is different enough from the seasonal vaccine component that it doesn't provide any protection, they think.",
        "So that's the concern.",
        "If it does start spreading, it can spread rapidly, and nobody's protected against it.",
        "It could spread rapidly.",
        "No, I think we have to - you know, we don't know how rapidly it's spreading.",
        "And that's another - that's probably the other big question, along why we see different kinds of seriousness of disease.",
        "You know, the New York outbreak at the St. Francis Preparatory School - which apparently was touched off by some kids who came, you know, went to Mexico and came back with the virus - is the one that might teach us most about how rapidly it might spread and how many generations infection it might cause.",
        "In other words, presumably, some of those kids got the virus from somebody in Mexico.",
        "So that's generation one.",
        "Some of those kids may have transmitted it to their fellow students when they got back home.",
        "That's generation two.",
        "We need to know whether some of those second generation people passed it on to somebody else.",
        "That would be generation three.",
        "And those are the kinds of things that really determine how transmissible it's going to be and whether it just dies out after one or two, which some flu viruses do, or whether it keeps going."
