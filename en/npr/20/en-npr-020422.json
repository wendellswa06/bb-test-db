        "I'm just wondering - you know, I understand that we need to be more prepared and we probably need to test that preparedness for outbreaks of certain things, but it seems like we're crying wolf just a few too many times.",
        "I encounter a lot of skepticism and a lot of people rolling their eyes, another outbreak, another SARS, another avian flu, another swine flu that just absolutely goes nowhere.",
        "And I'm sure you're worried about crying wolf and not rooting for something that would kill millions of people, Al.",
        "But let's get a response from Richard Knox.",
        "I think that's a really important point, and I've been thinking about it a lot, too.",
        "You know, there's a really difficult line to walk if you're a public health person who really - whose job it is to try to head things off and find things early and do everything you can to minimize an emerging problem, the really line but very difficult line between preparedness and communication about what might happen and raising false alarm - you know, crying wolf.",
        "And I don't think there's a really perfect answer to that.",
        "I do know and I can say, having covered this for some years now, that the avian flu H5N1 virus really was taken very seriously by people around the world, scientists who know, and they weren't just, you know, trying to scare us or get research dollars, merely.",
        "And it turns out that, at least from what we know so far, having watched it for years, it doesn't - hasn't acquired the capacity to transmit efficiently from human to human to human.",
        "This one looks different so far, because, you know, it - we've seen with this one, this new swine flu virus or whatever we want to call it, is different from H5N1 that we've been watching so long.",
        "We have clusters and we have cases breaking out in various parts of the country, although sporadic so far.",
        "And we have whatever's going happen - whatever's going on in Mexico.",
        "We don't clearly understand what's going in Mexico, but it's a big thing, whatever it is.",
        "So I think that it's totally justified.",
        "You know, people, you know, need to be skeptical about everything these days.",
        "But I think it's totally justified to take these warnings seriously, and I think that's what the federal government -you know, from President Obama on down to everybody else - is trying to convey.",
