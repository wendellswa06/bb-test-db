        "So the CDC on their Web site does have clear guidelines.",

        "We see them in Japan and China on TV.",
        "Should we be thinking about wearing those, especially if we're traveling, and if so, what kinds of cloth or paper masks?",
        "What do you recommend, or are they just not effective against viruses?",
        "Seeing a lot of masks in Mexico, too.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes, really, really great questions that you're asking and really some difficult answers.",
        "What we do know is the simple measures that prevent transmission of any virus make a lot of sense, you know, frequent hand-washing or use of alcohol gels, covering mouths when you cough, etcetera.",
        "The CDC hasn't put out any wide scale recommendations on masks at present.",
        "We don't fully understand right now how this particular virus is transmitted.",
        "Most flu viruses, though, the way the mask works, actually, is that it keeps you from taking your hand and touching it to your nose or touching it to your mouth.",
        "So rather than being spread widely through the air, it's actually spread through close contact, and the CDC has defined that as within six feet, so really close contact.",
        "So at the moment, certainly there's no recommendation in the United States for widespread use of masks."

        "If a swab comes back negative, does that mean that swine flu is ruled out entirely?",
        "That's an excellent question.",
        "Again, it really depends on the type of diagnostic test that's being used in the individual hospital or health department.",
        "Most health departments actually will be able to pick this up, but they won't be - they will know that it's an Influenza-A, and then they'll have to send it on for more testing.",
        "But there could be some rapid diagnostic tests that are used in doctors' offices or in certain hospitals that may or may not pick this up.",
        "So I think at this point, it's best to work through your local or state health department if you're in a physician's office or at a hospital, to be sure that the test you have can pick up this type of virus.",

        "The emergency room was pretty much packed 24 hours a day with people coming in who developed a cough, a fever, and being understaffed already and having the current state of the economy, people losing their insurance, I can just see this whole thing happening all over again, people getting very concerned and starting to panic and overrun the emergency rooms again, and tax an already taxed health system.",
        "Yeah, I think at this point, you know, that's a very good point.",
        "I also was doing infection control during the SARS epidemic, and it does become difficult to know what to tell patients or people who think they may be patients, may have flu and are concerned about it."

        "I think one important message to remember here is that the cases so far in the United States have been mild cases, and that's good news, and as I told the earlier caller, to encourage people who have mild illness and don't have other medical illnesses, so otherwise healthy people to perhaps make a phone call first.",
        "Now, if somebody has other high-risk conditions, you know, people with cancer or very elderly people or infants, then we're always more concerned about those populations, but a healthy person with mild illness just does not need to go to the emergency room and may start with a phone call to a health care provider.",
        "Right.",
        "I'm glad you said that, because we've had people now who don't have any health insurance and don't even go to their doctors first because they will come to the emergency room first because they don't have a co-pay then.",
        "So we're, you know, kind of concerned about being inundated by this, but I'm glad you said that about them calling first.",

        "What is this tax break that Delta wants?",
        "That's a very good question.",

        "By halfway through the flight, they were sneezing and coughing, and towards the end of the flight, they were really having a rough time breathing with spasmodic coughing.",
        "I got off the flight and I called the CDC and the, you know, Massachusetts Public Health Department and was, you know, basically shined on.",
        "And I'm wondering - finally, I was able to reach somebody in the Massachusetts department, one of the branches who said, well, you know, when the old governor was here, Mitt Romney, he cut a lot of the funding and so we're letting people go left, right and center and we don't have anybody to follow up on that.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Is that something that his concern should be followed up upon, Dr. Neuzil?",
        "Well, again, I think it's very difficult to take individual cases.",
        "If you look at all the viruses and the respiratory illness - you know, if you look at children, for example, in the course of a year, most children will have between one and three upper respiratory illnesses.",
        "And we have 40 cases of swine flu right now in the United States.",
        "So there's going to be a lot of background illness out there.",
        "On the other hand, it's this type of early detection and being attuned to this that allows public health officials to track it and see how serious it is.",
