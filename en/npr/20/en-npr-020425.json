        "It doesn't sound like proportionally it's a ton of money.",

        "You know, you're right, Ailsa.",
        "It's not about the money.",
        "It's about the national conversation surrounding gun control, Delta not wanting to be a part of that conversation but ultimately not having a choice.",
        "And it's also a part of the conversation about Georgia politics.",
        "Georgia is electing a new governor in November, and Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle is a candidate running for governor, so this has quickly become a campaign issue.",
        "So as this issue is getting more and more national reaction, what's the potential fallout?",
        "I mean, the fallout for Georgia because I assume it's a state that wants to continue looking like a place where companies can do business.",
        "Well, Georgia is electing a new governor in November, and many people are watching.",
        "Voters are watching.",
        "Other candidates are watching to see what people are saying.",
        "And businesses may be watching.",
        "Atlanta is a finalist for the new Amazon headquarters, and it could be that Amazon picks somewhere else to go.",
        "But Delta is a longtime, homegrown company.",
        "And the perception may be the state might not be as welcoming as advertised, and Amazon may look elsewhere.",

        "The mystery novel has a mixed pedigree.",

        "But the genre also thrives in less elite corners of the book store, campy pulp mysteries with busty dames on the cover, or the ever popular airport-mystery section.",
        "And mystery genre isn't just wide, but deep.",
        "It ranges from hard-boiled police dramas to supernatural thrillers.",
        "If you are a new writer just starting out, sorting out the clues to your first mystery novel, and then your second and third, might be daunting.",
        "Will you concentrate on setting, on characters, or maybe that one gasp-worthy plot twist?",
        "This hour, we'll talk with some new mystery novelists about how they construct their books, but we want to hear what you think.",
        "What do you think are the most important ingredients for a modern mystery novel?",
        "Is it the setting, the character, the plot twist?",
        "Tell us your story, but give us a spoiler alert, please, if need be.",

        "So, Tana, what made you think you could take on the mystery genre?",
        "Well, I really never did, but I think it was probably always inevitable, because I've been fascinated by mysteries ever since I was a little kid, real mysteries, fictional mysteries, every kind.",
        "I think the only thing that made me thing that made me think I could take it on was that I had the idea.",
        "I was working on an archeological dig in between - I'm an actor - in between two shows.",
        "And there was a wood not far from the dig, and I thought one day, wow, that would be a great place for kids to play.",
        "And see, this is kind of what I mean about mystery writers, they're always looking for the potential mystery in anything.",
        "So, instead of stopping at great place for kids to play, the way, I don't know, normal people might, I thought, what if three kids run in there to play and only one came out, and he had no memory of what had happened to the other two?",
        "And then, what if he became a detective and another murder case drove him back to the wood?",
        "And I didn't think that I could write an entire book, but I figured I could probably write maybe one little section, and then maybe another little section.",
        "Then the next thing I knew, things were fitting together and I had a chapter.",
        "Basically, the only thing that made me think I could write it was that I wanted to find out what happened next.",
        "You know, the book has a very contemporary kind of - well, when I use the word contemporary, I mean a very sort of fresh kind of approach, I think, to the mystery, which is, a product, I think, in part, of its setting, which is the city of Dublin, and in part, of the way you used your characters.",
        "So, which came first?",
        "Does it - the setting, is that because you lived in Dublin?",
        "But - or the way you used characters?",
        "Which were more important to you?",
        "As NPR Nell Greenfieldboyce tells us, scientists recently took some lessons from termites to design a team of robot construction workers.",
        "Some insects are good at building things, think of a wasp's nest or an underground labyrinth of ant tunnels.",
        "But Justin Werfel says those insect homes are nothing compared to a big termite mound.",
        "Termites are the real masters of construction in the insect world.",
        "The largest termite mound on record was 42 feet tall.",
        "He says each mound has a complicated network of tunnels inside.",
        "The overall shape of the amount depends on the species.",
        "Some of them have an open chimney in the center and hot air can come rising out of that.",
        "Some of them are closed mounds.",
        "There are what are called cathedral mounds, they have all these elaborate ridges on the outside like flight buttresses."

        "Millions of insects were together to build these complex, large-scale structures by doing stuff like pushing bits of mud around.",
        "And yet they're not following a blueprint or listening to orders from some termite supervisor.",
        "Instead, they seem to sense what's around them and apply some simple rules to decide what to do next.",
        "That's what inspired Werfel and his colleagues at Harvard University to create robot termites.",
        "We've created this system of multiple independent robots that build things we ask for.",
        "And they do it more like the way insects act than the way that robots normally act.",
        "The robots don't look like termites.",
        "They look more like black, mechanical beetles.",
        "They're about eight inches long.",
        "They have just a few onboard sensors that let them navigate around a work site set up in a lab.",
        "Each robot can grab a specially-designed square brick, carry it on its back, and then set it down.",
        "Werfel says that he and his team program the robots to follow some simple rules.",
        "They build things that are much larger than themselves.",
        "They climb on what they are working on building to get to higher places, and they coordinate what they are doing using a tool that termites use.",
        "Rather than talk to one another directly, they coordinate indirectly by changing their shared environment.",
        "So one puts down some material, another one comes along and reacts to that material, and uses that to help it decide later whether to put more material down.",
        "The termite-inspired robots are described in the journal Science.",
        "Researchers show how programming the robots to follow different sets of rules can produce a variety of structures, from castles to pyramids.",
        "So far, the robots have only made modest structures and they do it slowly.",
        "For example, they built one that's shaped like a trident.",
        "And that involves only eight bricks and that takes half an hour.",
        "The vision is that, someday, swarms of robots could stack up sandbags to protect against flooding, or go to Mars and build living quarters for astronauts.",
        "That's still a long way off.",
        "But this study is a proof of principle that robots can work together like termites to build complex structures.",
        "And Hod Lipson says that's a big deal.",
        "He's an engineer at Cornell University who specializes in robotics.",
        "It's one of these things where the idea has been around for a while, that you can have robots cooperate to construct something larger than themselves, but no one has really been able to get that to work.",
        "And it's not because of any specific detail, but it's sort of coordinating everything together.",
        "He thinks this study opens up a lot of new possibilities for thinking about how to use machines as builders in the future."
