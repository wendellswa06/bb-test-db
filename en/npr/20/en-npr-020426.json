        "And I think in that way, crimes are such a barometer of a society, its priorities, its weaknesses, its tensions, its stresses, that crime novels automatically becomes something that tells you a lot about the world in which they're rooted.",

        "If you take, for example, in America, I know there was - just an explosion of serial-killer novels in the '90s, with Patricia Cornwall and people like this.",

        "Mr.",
        "BAYARD.",
        "Yeah, that's a good description of what I do.",
        "I kind the go into the 19th century, mostly, and hang out there, but then bring my own 21st-century sensibility into it, and create a kind of hybrid between the two areas.",

        "Because I never particularly liked Tiny Tim, or found him in anyway convincing.",
        "So, I thought the best way to do that is to make him a grownup and take away his crutch, and put him in - plop him in the middle of Victorian underworld, and let him find for himself, as it were.",
        "And really, as Tana was talking about, I didn't set out to write a mystery.",
        "But I slowly realized that that was the best form for producing this change in Tim Cratchit, for making this new creation out of him, that that would set him in motion.",
        "And that's what mysteries are great at doing, is setting characters in motion, sometimes literally, because they are running away from somebody, but it - they have to change and adapt and, in a way, realize who they are underneath all these other creations of sentiment and people's assumptions.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And at the same time, by going back in the past, as I said, it creates a new kind of mystery novel.",
        "So it has, again, very different from Tana's, but has a very contemporary feel as a result of that.",
        "Of course, Maggie Speak says it's easy to make fun of someone else's story.",
        "Yeah, I like to think so.",
        "I think there're books that read other books.",
        "The Pale Blue Eye\"\" is reading Edgar Allan Poe's work, and creating the conditions out of which Poe would wind up creating those immortal stories, \"\"The Tell-Tale Heart\"\" and \"\"The Pit and the Pendulum\"\" and all that stuff that still gives us shivers.",
        "I was trying to figure out how this young man, a cadet at West Point, Edgar Allan Poe, gets to the point of being able to write those things.",

        "Do they follow the right procedures?",
        "Do they skip things?",

        "Yeah.",
        "That it was very easy to slide off that and assume that Irish police procedure is the same.",
        "So I just asked him everything.",
        "What are the words of the caution?",
        "At what age can you question someone without a parent or guardian present?",
        "But also, apart from that, he also told me stories, which I think is just crucial, because the actual procedure can only tell you the technicalities, can only tell you the framework of what it's like to do this incredibly high-stakes and emotionally-involving job.",
        "But when you listen to detectives talk, and you start to hear what are the little things that haunt them, that stay with them, what are the things that matter most, the things that frustrate them, that's when you get the atmosphere.",
        "And I do occasionally - I've got to admit - depart from the reality, things like there isn't a murder squad in Dublin - there's one big National Bureau of Criminal Investigation - but I figured the story needed that intense, intimate, elite, small squad feel.",
        "But I do want to know that if I'm going to depart from reality, it's going to be because the story requires it, not because I'm making some kind of clueless mistakes.",
