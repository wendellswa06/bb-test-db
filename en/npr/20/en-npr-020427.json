        "I wanted to ask you both about the idea of the mystery series, because frequently, people who like mysteries will attach themselves to one author or another who has the same character that - they see them through any number of books, and people who like mysteries frequently like those kinds of series.",
        "Clearly, Louis, you are not writing a series of those kinds of books, although you are writing - they're similar in the sense that in each one you're going back in history and then making it kind of contemporary.",
        "Right.",
        "The mode is similar but the characters, the circumstances, change from book to book.",
        "I have to say, I love reading series novels, I mean, Sherlock Holmes, for God's sakes.",
        "Alexander McCall Smith's books are fun.",
        "But I would go mad with boredom if I had to write the same characters with each book.",
        "To me, that's the excitement of any new book, really, is the possibility that I might fail.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "That's the thing that kind of gets me jazzed.",
        "I know that it's worth taking on if I don't really know if I can do it.",
        "And I could see - getting to the point - where it's, well, we're going back to this well again.",
        "Here's old, you know, Parson Summers, whoever your detective is.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Good name, (unintelligible).",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So, yeah, for me, it's the excitement of a one-off and doing it fresh each time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But it takes longer."

        "Yeah.",
        "And Tana, you're not doing a series, but as I think I've mentioned already, you do have similar characters in your two books so far, but you used those characters differently.",
        "It's not like in each one, like, Cassie...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Who is clearly the character that takes you from one book to the next most clearly, but she plays a different role in each of the books.",
        "Yes, she's kind of the sidekick, the second lead, I think, in \"\"In the Woods,\"\" and in \"\"The Likeness,\"\" she's actually the narrator.",
        "And I thought a lot - it's what Louis was saying about how many mystery pares a character down to their essentials, and it really - it tests the core of them.",
        "And when I was writing \"\"In the Woods,\"\" I'm starting to think about, wow, if anybody actually wants to publish this, they might want another one.",
        "And I thought, well, the classic thing to do is a series, but what I'm interested in is writing about those huge turning points in a character's life, where they really are stripped to that core, and those crossroads where you know that no matter which way you choose, your life will never be the same place again.",
        "And \"\"In the Woods\"\" definitely is up for Rob Ryan, the narrator, but the thing about those crossroads is that any normal human being only gets, I don't know, two or three in a lifetime.",
        "So, when I wanted to write a second book, I could either keep dumping the poor guy...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Into, like, life-changing moment after moment, or I could take it to the series thing, where you follow this character through the ups and downs.",
        "But for me, that's not what the psychological mystery really was about.",
        "That's not what I wanted to write about.",
        "I love reading them, but I want to write about those high-stakes moments.",
        "So, it seemed like the only option was to switch narrator.",
        "And there is - I do want to keep writing about the same group of main characters for awhile.",
        "I kind of got interested in them and I'm not done with Rob Ryan yet, but I'm hopping narrator to see the crucial points in each person's life.",
        "OK.",
        "She just said something that, if you haven't read the book, it's hard to talk about it.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But she's not done with Rob Ryan yet.",
        "And I just say, if anybody's read the book, you're going to get that.",
        "Anybody that hasn't..."

        "Yeah...",
        "Rob Ryan has a past, and we didn't completely resolve that, I think.",
        "But at any rate, OK, moving on, what I think is interesting about what you're doing, Tana, is that you are - that idea of looking at one group and then looking at them from sort of a different perspective, it really does keep - if you've got that interest in a series, it keeps that series idea there, because you want to see where those characters are going to be next time around.",
        "But you're not just stuck on one character.",
        "And so, it's a really kind of fresh way to take that whole series idea on.",
        "I'm glad to hear you're going to continue it.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, I'm hoping to continue it.",
        "I'm starting the third book and Frank Mackey, who's Cassie's old undercover boss from \"\"The Likeness,\"\" is the narrator in book three.",
        "And I think it makes it easier to create a whole world which these characters inhabit if you move around within the same general group of them.",
        "And it also provides - I'm interested in the fact that one person's perception of reality is not necessarily reality.",
        "Like, Rob in \"\"In the Woods,\"\" is a very unreliable narrator.",
        "Cassie is a little bit more reliable, but still, different people know different things and perceive indifferently.",
        "So, by moving around from narrator to narrator, you get different angles on what the shared reality is.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's take a call now from Sean.",
        "And Sean's calling from Ann Arbor, Michigan.",
        "Hi, Sean.",
        "Hi.",
        "How are you?",

        "Good.",
        "That's a great kind of bridge into my question.",
        "I was wondering if either of your guests have read Wilkie Collins' \"\"The Moonstone,\"\" and if so, whether it's influenced their views on the mystery or the detective novel in particular.",
        "I love \"\"The Moonstone.\"\" That is one of my very favorite mysteries of all time.",
        "Wilkie Collins in general is a wonderful writer and one of the greatest plot-smiths.",
        "In fact, Dickens, who was a friend of Wilkie Collins, used to learn - had actually learned about plotting from the example of Collins.",
        "The Woman in White\"\" is another great Wilkie Collins book and \"\"No Name.\"\" If you're going to Victorian mysteries, those are the places to start.",
        "OK, great."

        "What about you, Tana?",
        "No, I know \"\"The Woman in White\"\" but not \"\"The Moonstone.\"\" But I do think that they are definitely classic mysteries that teach you everything you need to know about plotting and the boundaries of the genre.",
        "My equivalent is probably Josephine Tey, who was writing in the '40s and '50s, and who plays with the boundaries of the genre in the most incredible ways.",
        "In one of her books, the most serious crime is basically wasting police time, and you find out who the villain is within a couple of pages.",
        "And yet, it is this gripping portrait of a young psychopath in development and in process.",
        "And so, I think, yeah, the classics really - they show what exactly can be done with this genre.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks much for your call, Sean.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Something else I wanted to ask you about is the whole idea of continuity in a mystery novel being very important because, you know, you have all these evidence that you're dealing with, and clues, and you have to keep track of it.",
        "Louis, you're nodding your head.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Hello.",
        "Thank you.",
        "One of the most influential books I think I ever read when I was about 16 or 17 was \"\"The Long Goodbye\"\" by Raymond Chandler, and even though the language is a bit dated, I still find it kind of a masterpiece of many different themes.",
        "And I think that mystery fiction is - ranks with any other form, really, of popular literature, as far as social commentary.",
        "That's the challenge, yeah.",
        "That's the challenge for any mystery writer, is to follow your own threads and not get tripped up on your own red herrings.",
        "What I've discovered, though, is that plot is something you can re-jigger.",
        "It doesn't have to be cast in stone, and in fact, I do a very minimal synopsis before I start, and I know where I end up, I know sort of stations along the way, but I give myself freedom to kind of just discover things as I go along.",
        "It's a little bit of that organic process that Tana was talking about.",
        "But conversely, I know people who - I know a thriller writer who writes 200-page outlines for 300-page books.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I can imagine going to all that work, and I wouldn't want to write the book after that.",
        "So, he clearly needs to know it all in advance."

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I've had to figure this out along the way.",
        "And that makes for huge amounts of rewriting.",
        "Because what happens is, you know, I'll write the first third of it, I'll keep going, the characters will develop a little bit differently, or the scenario will develop a little bit differently, and I have to go back and rewrite the entire first chapter, because I've just found out that, you know, the murder couldn't have happened at the time that I planned it.",
        "So, it does make for - you do have to do an incredibly rigorous final check for glitches because, yeah, there are - I do keep finding glitches right up until I - you know, after I turned it in because of the fact that this is the way that I write, without a synopsis, without a plan, and I'm incredibly jealous of writers who do have a synopsis, and I want to be them when I grow up.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And those are the glitches that some readers are going to come up and confront you with at some book store.",
