        "What's happening, Steve, is that there's a riff opening up in the collective response to the Malala shooting.",
        "Let me quote the opening line of the lead editorial in Pakistan's Dawn newspaper this morning.",
        "Let's get one thing straight, the paper says, the attack on Malala is not comparable to drone strikes.",
        "Now, the reason the paper is saying this is because some Pakistanis - particularly from the Islamist parties, but also members of the public - are beginning to ask a question.",
        "And that question is: Why is everyone so outraged about Malala and so eager to help her when they've done nothing for the estimated hundreds of civilians, including children, killed by missiles fired by CIA drones into the tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan?",
        "Well, this is classic political rhetoric, is it not, basically changing the subject?",
        "It's changing the subject but it is touching on an issue that's a hugely emotive one here.",
        "And you know, I went up to the Quaid-i-Azam University here in Islamabad and this was a big topic amongst students.",

        "He says he thinks that that's why in the tribal belt people will carry on supporting Islamist militancy, despite the attack on Malala, which he also, by the way, condemns.",
        "The tribal people will continue to give adherence to the mullahs because of the policies of Americans.",
        "They fail to understand the local dynamic.",
        "Again, the question arises - only a young girl, a young girl has been attacked, and you are giving so much coverage.",
        "And what about we people?",
        "We people are living in tribal area, we haven't been given so much coverage.",
        "So the shooting of this girl has been turned against the people who would condemn it?",
        "The shooting of this girl is still condemned by people who express opinions like the one you just heard, but they are saying that there is no moral difference between shooting Malala and the killing of civilians in drone strikes that are intended to target militants.",
        "And that moral debate is now underway big time in Pakistan.",
        "Phil, thanks very much.",
