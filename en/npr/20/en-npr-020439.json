        "Now, Karadzic was spirited out of Belgrade in rather a dramatic fashion.",

        "That was a shock for the public.",

        "Yes, he was discovered working to be as some sort of healer, yes.",
        "Remind us of what he did as president of a Bosnian Serb republic in the early 90s that led to these charges of crimes against humanity and genocide.",
        "In Bosnia we had a bloody war, you already said.",
        "And you were right - that was the biggest massacre in Europe after the Second World War.",
        "But one has to be also precise about that.",
        "It is definitely established the number of victims in Bosnia is less than 100,000.",
        "That is the number of all victims from all ethnic groups in Bosnia.",
        "So, Karadzic is indicted and definitely responsible for big massacres in Bosnia, but he certainly is not responsible for, as it was mentioned, these days, for allegedly 300,000 lives.",
        "For, I guess, American listeners, what are the several events that stick out within the broad outlines of this war for which Mr. Karadzic is being held responsible.",
        "I think it's a siege of Sarajevo first of all, and then massacre at Srebrenica.",
        "This is definitely the case or genocide in Bosnia, committed by the soldiers of the Bosnia-Serb army, and Mr. Karadzic must be responsible for whatever was happened there.",
        "That massacre you speak of, just to be clear, that was of somewhere between seven and eight thousand Muslim men and boys…"
