        "Senator Barack Obama is touring battleground states all this week, where the race for the White House will be fought.",
        "He's been hammering John McCain on the economy - the number one issue for voters - and he's reaching out to those white voters in small towns in rural areas that he still needs to win over.",
        "NPR's Mara Liasson reports that Obama enters the general election with obvious strengths but also some big vulnerabilities.",
        "Obama's strengths are apparent.",
        "He can draw huge crowds, register millions of new voters, and raise money like no other candidate in history.",
        "He's also a giant killer - outmaneuvering the powerful Clinton machine in a one-on-one contest.",
        "But in the end, Obama limped across the finish line.",
        "He lost nine of the last 14 primaries, and although Democrats are uniting behind their nominee, there's a lot to make them nervous about Obama's ability to beat John McCain in the fall.",
        "Leon Panetta, who was Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff, points to what could be the biggest problem: Obama's weak showing with swing voters in swing states.",
        "By virtue of having lost some of those big states and some of those very important constituencies - Latino, white rural, you know, a lot of the blue collar, women's vote - he can't afford to not get those votes back in the Democratic Party.",
        "Those fault lines have cost the Democrats, I think, seven of the last 10 presidential races.",
        "And if they open up and stay unhealed, then there's no question that he ultimately loses.",
        "In the primaries, Obama won only about a third or less of the Catholic vote, the white working-class vote, Hispanics and white seniors.",
        "He even has problems with Jews - all key voting groups for a Democrat hoping to win in what could be a close race.",
        "Some of these voters might say they're wary of Obama because he didn't wear a flag pin or because he has a radical ex-pastor or because they think falsely that he's a Muslim.",
        "In the later primaries, one in five white voters admitted to exit pollsters that race was a factor in their refusal to vote for Obama.",
        "But pollster Andy Kohut thinks that could change in a general election.",
        "These are pretty deep-seeded things - race is an issue.",
        "On the other hand, these are his weaknesses relative to Hillary Clinton.",
        "We don't know what his weaknesses are relative to John McCain.",
        "A certain number of the Hillary Clinton Democrats will come home to Obama in the fall.",
        "But what about working-class whites, Hispanics or independents who didn't vote in the Democratic primaries?",
        "According to the latest Pew poll, Obama's favorability rating among independents has dropped 13 points since February, a sign that the long primary campaign has taken its toll.",
        "Another concern some Democrats have is toughness.",
        "Obama remained cool under pressure and never got knocked off message, but Leon Panetta is puzzled that he seemed to run out the clock instead of pushing harder at the end."

        "Whether it was exhaustion or whether it was just kind of hoping that you could ride your early victories, there didn't seem to be that continuing fight that you have to have if you're going to win an election.",
        "That's something he has got to find again, because there's no question that if he thinks the primaries were tough, wait till he gets to this general election.",
        "Veteran Democratic strategist Bill Kerik has spent his career handicapping political candidates, and he says Obama is not always a happy warrior.",
        "It's an interesting dynamic.",
        "There's an authenticity to Barack Obama that expresses itself both in good times and bad.",
        "When things are going well, he just is incandescent.",
        "But when times are tough, he looks like, well, I don't like this and I'm uncomfortable, and I'm going to let you know it.",
        "Here is Obama at a news conference in March, impatiently cutting off questions about his relationship with now-convicted fund raiser Tony Rezco.",
        "Wait, wait, guys, come on now.",
        "I just answered like eight questions.",
        "Kerik also worries about Obama's uneven performance in debates, particularly the last one, where he was hammered by the moderators and his opponent, something he can look forward to again in the general.",
        "He's going to have to get better at debating than he's been in the primary process.",
        "He's also going to have to figure out how to put himself in the drive mode and be consistent every day, which is tough.",
        "I mean, it requires a mental and physical discipline that is unlike any other experience people have.",
        "The Republicans, of course, have been taking notes.",
        "And given that John McCain is facing the worst political landscape for a Republican since Watergate, GOP pollster Glenn Bulger is relieved to find out that Obama may have feet of clay.",
        "Lance Ulanoff is editor-in-chief of PCMag.com.",
        "He says the Flip was undone by still cameras and video cameras becoming standard equipment on smartphones.",
        "The smartphones that we carry today can do many things, including capture high-definition, high-quality video.",
        "So suddenly, why would you want to carry around a device that only does one thing when you can carry around one that will do many?"

        "Ulanoff says Cisco made one big mistake with the Flip.",
        "While iPhones, Androids and BlackBerries were constantly improving, the Flip didn't change much from its original design.",
        "In particular, as consumers got used to taking video on the go and uploading it directly to the Web, Cisco never introduced a corresponding wireless capability on the Flip.",

        "It was two years ago today that financial markets were in crisis following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.",
        "Congress and the Bush administration were scrambling to stabilize the situation, and one of their answers was the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.",

        "NPR's John Ydstie reports.",

        "Now with the program's authority set to expire October 3rd, the Oversight Panel is assessing its effectiveness.",
        "The panel concludes that while the program did help stabilize financial markets and quell the crisis, it has not achieved other goals specified in its Congressional mandate, like helping struggling homeowners.",
        "Here's the panel's Deputy Chairman Damon Silvers in a conference call with reporters.",
        "Since it was authorized, 7.1 million homeowners have received foreclosure notices.",
        "Silvers says the TARP has also been ineffective in protecting retirement accounts, home values and promoting jobs and economic growth, which are other goals for the program.",
        "The Oversight Panel also found that the Treasury Department's lack of transparency and failure to communicate the TARP's purpose eroded confidence in government action.",
        "The TARP's unpopularity may have cost the government some of its ability to respond to future financial crisis.",
        "While the TARP is winding down, some of the programs it spawned will continue.",
        "The Oversight Panel shuts down in April."
