        "Congressman Smith's Bill would do more than just write into law existing abortion restrictions.",
        "It would also eliminate tax benefits for insurance policies that cover abortion - even abortions in most cases of medical necessity.",
        "NARAL's Donna Crane says the effect could be far reaching.",
        "If you are a health insurance plan and you are selling your product and all of a sudden it becomes that much more expensive, because there are tax penalties imposed on it, you're probably going to change the nature of your product.",
        "And in this case, we're quite certain that Chris Smith intends for health insurance plans to drop their abortion coverage.",
        "Unlike the bill to repeal the entire health law, which is given basically no chance of passing the Senate, anti-abortion legislation is seen as having a good chance.",
        "That's because many Democrats in that chamber oppose abortion rights too."
