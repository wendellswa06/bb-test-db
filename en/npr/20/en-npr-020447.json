        "At the end of the day, what the American people need to look at is - will our debt, the amount of money that we owe foreigners, and our investors and our own folks who own bonds, will we owe less debt 10 years from now if we have this plan?",

        "And I'm sure there will be some pushback.",
        "There's things in this plan for everybody to like, in terms of deficit reduction, but there's also things that everybody will dislike.",
        "That's a big Democratic give, that one, you're saying.",
