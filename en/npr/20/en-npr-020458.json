        "Well, we made a decision that Michigan was going to be a fight between Santorum and Romney, and I wanted to focus on what comes after Michigan and Arizona.",

        "You know, I was supposedly dead back in June and July.",
        "And by December, without having bought a single ad, just on the power of positive, big ideas, I was ahead by somewhere between 15 and 21 points in national polling.",
        "And so my goal is to come back, repeat what we did in South Carolina, win a number of states on Super Tuesday.",

        "The governor of Texas believes that I will probably win virtually all the 155 delegates in Texas.",
        "And I think we have a very real shot because of the way California's now apportioned that we could win a surprising number of delegates from California.",
        "So I think I'm very comfortable going all the way to Tampa.",
        "If you are, say, not the nominee, and let's say Mitt Romney is, could you foresee endorsing him, even campaigning for him?",

        "None of us want to see Barack Obama re-elected.",
        "We think it'll be a disaster for the country.",
        "But I mean, you've made it clear that you don't believe Mitt Romney is a true conservative.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But Romney is certainly not a radical on the scale of Obama.",
        "So it's a comparative decision.",
        "I think Obama is a genuinely dangerous radical who's out of touch with reality and whose vision of the world is fundamentally false.",

        "You know, 85 percent of the acreage offshore is currently unavailable for exploration.",
        "It's estimated that by simply permitting to go back to regular business in Gulf, you add 400,000 barrels a day to American supply.",
        "If you permit the development of known resources in Alaska, you add about a million, 200,000 barrels a day to American supply.",
        "And that's without expanding in any significant way.",
        "And it's a basic fact of supply and demand.",
        "If the U.S.",

        "And I'm very proud of the fact that places I carry, Republican turnout is up; and the places he carries, Republican turnout is down.",
        "So I'm pretty happy to be doing what we're doing.",
        "I think my message of 2.50 a gallon gasoline is getting through.",
        "Do you think that the eventual Republican nominee will be able to defeat Barack Obama in November as it stands now?",
        "Oh, I think the Republican nominee will beat Barack Obama because I think five or $6 a gallon gasoline, a decaying economy, a $2 trillion deficit, a weak national policy, and apologizing for America across the world is not a very good model to run for election on.",
        "If you are not the nominee this time around, would you run again?"
