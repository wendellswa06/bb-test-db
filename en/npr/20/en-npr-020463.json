        "He brings over a rusty chunk of metal, the size of a memo pad with jagged edges and drops it on the ground.",
        "Muneer's cousin, 18-year-old Hisham(ph) Tambura, says the shelling is so heavy at night they can't sleep.",
        "He says he's afraid to come to the strawberry fields now.",

        "Usually Zarzak exports most of his crop via Israel to Europe.",
        "But Israel has closed the Carney(ph) Crossing Point for most of the past month, and Zarzak is forced to sell his berries on the local market in Gaza for a fraction of what he usually gets.",
        "The closure of the crossing has also stopped goods from entering Gaza.",
        "United Nations' officials say stocks of wheat, sugar and cooking oil are dwindling in Gaza and could begin to run out within days.",
        "Israeli officials say the Carney Crossing is closed because of specific warnings of planned terrorist attacks.",
        "And they say the frequent Israeli shelling of Northern Gaza is a response to Palestinian rocket attacks on Southern Israel.",

        "As was true with Iran, a willingness on the Saudi's part to settle prices by putting more oil on the world market has been rewarded, on Washington's part, by a willingness to sell to Saudi's another enormous package of sophisticated weapons.",

        "And if you think about the implications of that, apartments, houses, offices, factories, all those things need to be built, and cement is a fundamental element of that.",

        "In the research that I've done and from what I know about the energy world, no. Because a lot of this growth that we see in Chinese energy usage and coal usage and those sorts of things, it's for the purpose of building a natural infrastructure.",
        "And remembering that, you know, many nations around the world and the first world have used a lot of energy over many, many years, well, China's just now trying to build theirs.",
