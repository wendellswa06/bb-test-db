        "In France, yeah.",
        "Have a kind of mixed and kind of ambiguous relationship with the state of France.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, let me - that's Michael Curtis.",
        "Let me take this to you, Susanna Wing, then, and ask you sort of the same question.",
        "What do you make of France's decision to intervene?",
        "Could it be a combination of a number of things?",
        "Sure, I would tend to agree with Michael Curtis that - and not take a cynical approach.",
        "I do think that Hollande benefited at home, but that was sort of a surprise addition to this action that he had taken really at the request of the Malian government.",
        "And I don't think we should forget that many - the majority of Malian people were hugely in support of this intervention because of their lives having been turned upside-down from the crisis, which began last year.",
        "So give me an example.",
        "Was there a particular food that was perhaps a favorite before chemo, and then you couldn't eat it?",
        "So sure, it's a combination of things, but to call it neocolonialism to my mind doesn't really fit just given the fact that this was an invitation, and that's not how we tend to think of neocolonialism.",
        "But there is clearly a deep connection between France as a former colonizer and Mali, and they were the country that was willing to step up to the plate right away when the ECOWAS and EU forces were just simply taking too long.",
        "Well then, George, how serious a threat is this terrorist group, the insurgents in the northern part of Mali?",
        "Is it al-Qaeda, as many people have described?",
        "Well, first of all it's not just one insurgency.",
        "There are in fact at least four groups involved.",
        "Some of them certainly are Islamists.",
        "One of them, at least, claims affinities with al-Qaeda, it calls itself al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.",
        "But the key force, the force that actually began the rebellion that ended up in the invasion of Southern Mali way back last March is in fact a Toureg force.",
        "And they were seeking independence for the northern part of Mali, which is part of a very long argument going back to the 1960s in terms of the way they feel they've been treated by the central Malian government.",
        "There is a lot of ethnic tension inside Mali, which partly explains that particular development.",
        "The Islamist groups, which have been based in Northern Mali, in the remote reaches of Northern Mali, for many, many years, then took advantage of that to extend their influence over the cities and towns there."

        "So you're looking at a very complicated situation.",
        "And beyond that, took, you need to consider whether, in fact, this is in reality a threat to surrounding states.",
        "Algeria, for example, has been dealing with this group ever since the 1990s, and I'm not certain really, despite the attack on In Amenas two weeks ago, that this represents an existential threat to the Algerian state.",
        "It does, however, represent a threat to the Sahelian states, and that's really why France felt it had to intervene, along with the fact that France also has felt that it has a watching brief over all its own old colonies in West Africa.",
        "OK, well, let me ask this for you, Michael, before we take a break.",
        "I mean, you can't deny that there's a relationship, as Susanna mentioned, based on colonial days between France and Mali that made it more likely that France would intervene than perhaps any other country.",
        "So to a certain extent France's intervention owes something to colonial days, doesn't it?",
        "Well, it's certainly true that France is the logical country to intervene.",
        "Their link with language, the official language of Mali is French, although many people don't speak it, and much of the civil law system is based on French civil law.",
        "So there are these legal and constitutional and kind of cultural links that still remain.",
        "Now I agree with the previous speaker, of course there's a great deal of tension within the Mali system.",
        "It's a very complex relationship, and you have got the remains of a struggle between the Berber population, the Touregs in the north, light-skinned, and the black population of the south, which is kind of a reminder of the historical importance of the slave trade.",
        "Remember Mali is not the greatest and most desirable country in the world.",
        "Slavery in Mali has persisted for centuries and to some extent persists in certain amounts.",
        "But I would disagree with the argument that it was the Touregs that led to the present dilemma.",
        "It did lead the movement to, of course, for independence and indeed set up a new state, which is called Azawad.",
        "It also has to be remembered that many of the arms which were used by these rebels came from Libya, and the Gadhafi outfit, and it was a military (unintelligible).",
        "And then tensions led to the fighting between the Touregs and the Islamist forces, which by July had been won by the Islamists, who have ended Toureg control.",
        "But I think the key thing that's significant for me in all this - there are two things.",
        "One that the United States foreign policy and the rest of the world, the United States position unwilling, of course, to be involved to any considerable degree in the conflict in Mali, but they're all aware now that Islamists threaten the security and even the existence of other states in Africa, especially Algeria, in the light of this insurgence of Islamic forces in so many of the Arab countries today.",
        "But the second thing is the actual experience now that is evidence of Islamic control of territory and the imposition of Sharia law and what it means in the prohibitions of free expression in all spheres, including music and dance.",
        "The newspapers have been full of what has been happening in the historic town of Timbuktu."

        "French planes targeted extremist training camps and weapons and fuel depots over the weekend, and the military has taken control of key cities and pushed the rebels into the desert, some of them into neighboring countries.",
        "A spokeswoman for the French armed forces has said they plan to leave Timbuktu this Thursday and move farther into the northeast, following fighters to remote outposts there.",
        "The French intervention raises questions about how former colonial power figures into present-day fighting.",
        "And Malians, we want to hear from you.",

        "And what do you think of French intervention?",
        "Well, we are very, very, very happy that French - the French government responded to the call for assistance from our constitutionally chosen interim president.",
        "Therefore, as far as we Malian are concerned, knowing the more than 350,000 Malian who have been displaced and some for more than a year and who are suffering in extraordinary fashion, we couldn't wish for more than to have the French come and help us get rid of this curse.",
        "By the way, let me add that to the credit of France and of the French president, when he said, in Timbuktu and also in the capital city of Mali(ph), that France is just trying to repay some debt, that France remembers that Malian and many other Africans fought in World War I and fought in World War II to liberate France, some of us just had tears to come dripping from our eye, because this means that we are talking about a brotherhood of nations where nations do remember what others have done, even if it is decades ago.",
        "So in short, we are extremely happy that France came to help.",
        "Oh let me add one more thing: All those powerful countries out there who may be sitting on the sidelines should understand or consult the French analysts and advisors, who knew that when you have a fanatical entity, there is no way to stop that one with dialogue or compromise, but by force.",
        "And therefore there is not a question that if weren't for the military intervention, these groups who brought with them the arms from Gadhafi and others and who are therefore much more armed than the soldiers in Mali, well, these groups were going to perfectly destroy Mali as a country and then deal with the rest of the world.",
        "But I will stop there and take any questions if somebody has any.",
        "Thanks so much, that's Jola.",
        "Thank you so much, calling, us from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.",
        "Susanna, let me have you respond to this.",

        "Well, that's a very fine statement.",
        "But let me go to Susanna here, real quickly, if I could.",
        "And Susanna, to a certain extent isn't Mali just further evidence that the fight against Islamic extremism is whack-a-mole?",
        "I mean, as they push them further north into - aren't they escaping into other countries?",
        "Well, I think that's certainly possible.",
        "They are blending into the population in many instances, some people going south so they can blend into those populations, others going north.",
        "And they're simply not just disappearing and going away.",
        "And the question is: How will they be able to reorganize themselves?",
        "Will they be able to effectively reorganize themselves?",
        "I think the idea that the French are going after camps and supply lines and those things, obviously that is an essential move, but many of these participants are just blending back into society.",
        "And what does that mean?",
        "We don't obviously know yet."

        "I like the point that the gentlemen from Baton Rouge raised, was about how the Malians themselves contributed to liberation struggles in France and to see this as being a turnaround.",
        "That's sort of a nice way to think of it.",
        "He certainly has expressed what I have heard from Mali, which is that people are extremely enthusiastic.",
        "And I think in some ways, what the French accomplished in three weeks, these people have been suffering for month after month.",
        "And so there's such a sense of relief that things were able to change so quickly.",
        "I think they're wondering why it took so long.",
        "Well, let me ask you a question, actually, that someone posed over the Internet here, George Joffe.",
        "This is from Gary(ph) in San Antonio, Texas, and he says this: Why can't we talk about the real issue?",
        "Just as the U.S.",
        "invaded Iraq largely for the oil resources, France is involved in Mali for the uranium resources and oil and gas.",
        "This is one of the first points made.",
        "Everyone spins it into politics and terrorism, which itself has its roots in superpowers exploiting the resources of smaller countries.",
        "Is that true, George?",
        "Well, it's partly true, that's to say the question of uranium is certainly very important as far as France is concerned.",
        "And the mines, actually in Niger next door, aren't so very far away from the areas occupied by the Islamic rebels in the north.",
        "And indeed it's interesting to note that the United States signed, last week, a status of forces agreement with the Nigerian government partly for that reason.",
        "So there is some truth in that.",
        "But I think one can't overlook the fact that there is also a geopolitical argument, and that is that if indeed Mali were to be taken over by Islamist groups, that would represent a very threatening element inside of the whole of the Sahelian region, the southern Saharan region.",
        "And worse still, it would link up with the rebels in the north of Nigeria, and that would be really very serious.",
        "So there is a very good argument for France to intervene from that point of view.",
        "The real problem is whether that was the only way in which this problem could be dealt with.",
        "The Algerians, for example, were very unhappy with the French intervention, even though they felt obliged to give them over-flight rights over Algeria, because they believed that they could solve the problem through negotiation, and they had in part succeeded by detaching at least one of the Islamist groups and the Toureg from the whole groups in the north that were occupying the country.",
        "So in a sense, there are two ways of approaching this, and many in Africa do feel, outside Mali, that in the end, negotiation of some kind will be necessary.",
        "Let me add one final point, and that is that the Islamist groups have been inside Mali ever since 2003.",
        "They've been there for a very long time.",
        "They were observed, people knew about them, but nobody was really prepared to do anything about it at all.",
        "And then, in fact, when the rebellion, the Toureg rebellion took place last year, even then no real action was taken despite a condemnation of the United Nations and the promise, eventually, of some troops from Africa.",
        "So in a sense the crisis that developed at the beginning of this month with the Islamist invasion of the southern part of Mali forced an intervention, and France necessarily, because of its old colonial links, was bound to be the state that would step up to the mark.",
        "That's George Joffe of Cambridge University.",
        "Let's turn it to Michael Curtis, professor emeritus of Rutgers University.",
        "So Michael, how will the French get out, then?",
        "I mean, obviously the Malian army is not going to be strong enough to resist any further insurgent attacks for quite some time.",
        "The African Union forces are not ready to do what France is ready to do.",
        "Is France stuck there?"
