        "Well, it's a difficult issue which France has taken.",
        "First of all, it may be true that the fact that there are resources of oil and gold and uranium in Mali do have some impact on the situation, but I don't think it's an important one in any way.",
        "And I repeat what was said before, it's a movement which is significant at indicating what is now a new post-neocolonialist era.",

        "Yeah.",
        "France wants African nations, an African force to come and take over the responsibility, whether this would take place or not, one doesn't know.",
        "Certainly, they're reasonably well-equipped, but they're rather poorly trained.",
        "The United States is providing some logistical help but not very much.",
        "But whether they can cope with the Islamic forces, the al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, the Ansad Dine, the Defenders of the Faith, which is an extreme Salafist group, and the so-called Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa is another matter.",
        "Yeah.",

        "I have to say what is relevant, you know, in this case is all the population, you know, of Timbuktu and Gao and (technical difficulty) heavy they were, you know, that the French did that.",
        "And, you know, the red, you know, I mean this issue is very complex because Mali is a landlocked country, you know, and this problem is, you know, we have the Algerian issue, you know, Libya, and Bamako, we also had a putsch(ph), you know, in March of 2012.",
        "So there is - this is a (unintelligible) issue.",
        "But for me, I'm a veterinarian, and, you know, when a cow is bleeding or a human being is bleeding, you know, you better do something right away.",
        "And I think Mali was bleeding and (unintelligible) just a couple days did the French did an intervention, you know, those Islamists, they will be in Bamako and will be (unintelligible) Somali, you know, (unintelligible).",

        "He said had it not been for the French intervention, the insurgents, the Islamic extremists would have taken over Bamako.",
        "What is it really at that stage?",
        "Where it was, was they were (unintelligible) taken over a town called Konna, and they were very close to a very important military airstrip in Sevare and an important town, Mopti.",
        "And it looked like they could have very quickly just headed straight down to Sevare.",
        "And had they taken that airstrip, that's the primary airstrip for any action, military action in northern Mali, so that would have been huge.",
        "And then we also saw with the fall of the town Giabali(ph) which is more to the west in the country, that was another movement towards Bamako."

        "So it was perfectly possible.",
        "I never would have said it before, but when you saw how well-armed they were and what little resistance they were facing in terms of the Malian army, it was certainly possible, and that would have been a fundamental disaster.",

        "What - we're listening to all these reasons why it was a good idea for France to intervene in Mali, and they're all very convincing.",
        "Why don't they apply to a place like, say, Syria?",
        "Well, there's a rather significant difference in the scale of the intervention required.",
        "If you intervene in Syria, it may well bring the current conflict to an end, but it will begin, as was the case in Iraq, a new insurgency against the occupying forces.",
        "And worse than that, given Syria's location inside the Middle East, it's likely to bring all the surrounding states into a situational conflict inside Syria too.",
        "And therefore, the implications of intervening in Syria are far, far greater than the implications of intervening in Mali.",
        "And indeed, in the case of Mali, the situation can in this sense be controlled because unlike Syria the areas in which the intervention is really taking place are largely very scarcely populated, and therefore, it's relatively easy to make sure that threats to surrounding countries can be easily contained too.",
        "And I think it's for that reason that the intervention in Mali has been possible, whereas the intervention in Syria is a much more frightening prospect for Western states.",
        "Let me go, again, it's a phone call here.",
        "This is Martin(ph) in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",
        "And, Martin, you're from Ghana, but you have your own ideas about why the French intervened.",
        "Why do you think?",
        "I'm just thinking that it is - could it be because of guilt.",
        "The way, you know, the - in 1844, the European nations who colonized Africa divided Africa in such a way that they divided, for instance, the Tuareg (unintelligible) into different countries and many - this is the cause of what is happening in Africa.",
        "And now, the French are saying, you know, we have to intervene because, one, we are the (unintelligible).",
        "It is our fault also that this is happening.",
        "No, I don't personally think that that is really a powerful argument.",
        "I - but I do think that there is this recognized ongoing commitment and connection.",
        "So I don't think this is in anyway a sort of French confession of having participated in the Berlin conference and carving up of African states, et cetera in the 1880s.",
        "But I do think that the French recognized that there's a close connection to this region because of colonialism and there are also many Malians who are French citizens now.",
        "And somebody brought up earlier, many Muslim citizens in Mali - in France, excuse me, who are French citizens who would support this action and who have family who are being basically run right over by these jihadis and wanted to see something done.",
        "So I don't think it's a move in terms of guilt, no.",
