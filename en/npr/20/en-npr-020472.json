        "They are telling you they will not fight for you.",
        "A lot of signs that Warren has been getting more momentum lately, and that includes the fact that she drew more than 6,000 people to a rally last night across the bay in Oakland, which, of course, is Kamala Harris's home city.",
        "Indeed.",
        "OK, 14 candidates are there.",

        "Former Vice President Joe Biden, who you could interpret that Warren line about incremental change and keeping the status quo, you could certainly interpret that to be her talking about the way that Biden is approaching this race.",
        "He is not taking the super progressive platform that many other candidates are.",
        "And I think that's part of the reason why he is avoiding this gathering of party activists and officials, who are often even more liberal than most California voters.",
        "In fact, Joe Biden is in Ohio today.",
        "He's basing his appeal on winning back the Midwest, the states that gave Trump the White House.",
        "And there's a lot of symbolism there that Joe Biden is in Ohio instead of California.",
        "But I'll say this, even in this crowd here in San Francisco today, when you talk to voters about what's most important to them, a lot of them are still saying it's all about electability, who can beat Donald Trump.",
        "And that is what Joe Biden is banking voters will see him as.",

        "It looks like a toy.",

        "This one is nuclear-powered, so no solar panels, so that makes it look different.",
        "And it's huge, and it's going to come down with this wacky new landing system they've come up with called the Sky Crane.",

        "Why the movie-like thought about this?",
        "Well, there's a couple of reasons why, but there's actually a video online, it's gone viral, called \"\"Seven Minutes of Terror,\"\" where folks from JPL who designed and built this system describe the entry, descent and landing.",
        "Just by comparison, when we enter on the space shuttle, it's 40 minutes.",
        "I wouldn't say it's 40 minutes of terror, but it's a relatively gentle event.",
        "The Martian atmosphere is very thin.",
        "It's like our atmosphere at 100,000 feet.",
        "And so the entry, descent and landing phase happens much quicker.",
        "In fact, it happens in just a little over seven minutes.",
        "And so this basically Apollo-like capsule will hit the top of the atmosphere at 13,200 miles an hour and decelerate at up to 10 g's of acceleration, maybe 11 g's of acceleration."

        "And then there's a whole sequence of miracles that occur to put the Curiosity Rover safely on the surface, starting with this deceleration, which is guided.",
        "It actually has the intelligence of Neil Armstrong encoded in its computers to try and guide it safely into the place where we can then deploy a supersonic parachute, which will, you know, with a huge pull open up and, you know, start grabbing the Martian atmosphere to try and slow it below the speed of sound, to get it slow enough and close enough to the surface, and it will still be screaming towards the surface at a couple of hundred miles an hour so that eight rockets can fire to decelerate it so that we can get into a hover position to slowly let down, as you said, on a sky crane, a bunch of wires - slowly let down the rover, deploy the wheels and gently set it on the surface before we cut all those wires, and the sky crane can fly aside and crash into the surface.",
        "And that whole thing takes about seven minutes.",
        "However, Mars is 248 million kilometers away, and so it takes about 14 minutes for the light to travel to Earth.",
        "So at the point that we get the first signals that the Curiosity system, the Mars Science Laboratory, is doing its thing, it will have already landed.",
