        "Late in the day after meeting with Alito, Judiciary Committee Chair Arlen Specter, who supports abortion rights, said Alito embraced the court ruling that opened the way for the Roe vs. Wade decision on a woman's right to abortion.",
        "He believes there is a right to privacy under the liberty clause of the United States Constitution.",
        "And he believes that the rights apply to singles as well as married under the interpretation of Griswold vs. Connecticut, and he says that he accepts Griswold vs. Connecticut as good law.",
        "For their part, Senate Democrats chided President Bush for not choosing a woman or a minority to replace Sandra Day O'Connor.",
        "The Judiciary panel's top Democrat, Patrick Leahy, also cited significant concerns about Alito's record.",
        "His opinions from the federal bench demonstrate that he'd go to great lengths to restrict the authority of Congress to enact protective legislation, to protect in the areas of civil rights, consumer protection, the rights of workers, consumers and women.",
        "Asked whether Democrats might filibuster Alito's nomination, New York Democrat Charles Schumer would not rule that out.",
        "It's too early to tell.",
        "Nothing is on the table, and nothing is off the table.",
        "Let's learn more about Judge Scalia.",
        "Schumer meant to say Judge Alito, but his slip shows how much Democrats view Alito as a soul mate of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, one of that court's most conservative members.",
        "David Welna, NPR News, the Capitol.",
        "Many years ago, a government spokesman, in a moment of candor, drew a distinction for me.",
        "He said to me, I did not answer your question.",
        "I gave you my response.",
        "That kind of distinction might be on Robert Mueller's mind.",
        "He's agreed to face questions before two House committees, but now he has to decide what questions he's really willing to answer.",
        "After he presented his report on Russian interference, Mueller appealed not to go before Congress at all."

        "And that's not entirely clear.",
        "Mueller is, of course, a man known for his by-the-book approach, plays by the rules, not someone who wants to be in the middle of a political fight - said as much in May, said he didn't want to testify.",
        "He also said that anything he did say wouldn't go beyond the information in the report.",
        "Negotiations between House Democrats and Mueller to get him up on the Hill to speak publicly about this took a very long time.",
        "Mueller's reluctance, and even possible reticence, hangs over all of this.",

        "What do Republicans on these House committees make of all this?",
        "Some Republicans who are ardent allies of the president on Capitol Hill are likely to use this as a way to chip away at the investigation.",
        "There are a lot of concerns that they have raised over the past two years about how the investigation was conducted.",
        "They have raised allegations of potential surveillance abuses by the FBI and the Justice Department.",

        "I mean, that is what it is doing.",
        "Whether it's poisoning the carpet in quite the same way, I'm not sure.",
        "But chemotherapy is a pretty strong - it's like using a sledgehammer to hit a nail.",
        "It's an all-body experience to get rid of errant cells.",
        "And I'd like to think that in the future, we'll look back on chemotherapy the way we look at leaches, and people say, really?",

        "I think it's exactly the same.",

        "So let's err, you know - everything from neuropathy and joint pain, which has kind of stayed on semi-permanently.",

        "But in the short term, cognitive function, I definitely have noticed a difference.",
        "And I think that you raised two things close to my heart: chemo-brain and joint pain, which is sort of an after-effect, which I still suffer from, which I think is partly due to the chemo and partly to the drugs that I'm on now, and in the grand scheme of things seems not as important as, you know, what oncology is focused on, which is your cancer.",
        "But it affects your quality of life.",
