        "But what are the other ways, Suleika?",
        "I mean, the question we're asking our listeners is what surprised them, what was unexpected.",
        "So besides, you know, sexual health and then your relationship with food, was there anything else that you weren't quite prepared for?",
        "I was surprised by - I guess when I first got diagnosed, you know, everyone was talking about what type of chemo do you do, what type of medications, and the focus wasn't so much on emotional wellness.",
        "And I think I was surprised by how incredibly isolated I felt as a young person with cancer.",
        "And, you know, I have these questions where I log on to my Facebook, and it would be my old profile picture with long, you know, waist-length hair.",
        "And I think to myself, like, do I come out of the cancer closet on Facebook?",
        "Do I update my profile to reflect where I am at now in my life?",
        "And eventually the answer to that question for me was yes because this has been, you know, a two-year battle that's ongoing, that there are all these social questions of, you know, how do I tell someone I have cancer?",
        "What do I do if they don't know what to say?",
        "And I've slowly, over time, learned to take initiative, especially when it comes to having a conversation with friends about cancer and saying, you know, and learning that it's up to me to set the tone because a lot of people, if they walk into a hospital room and see you bald for the first time, aren't going to know what to say about that.",
        "So, for me, I would say, oh, how weird do I look with bald hair, or something like that...",
        "Right.",
        "...you know, just to kind of get it out there and to put it out there.",
        "You're hoping it - easier for them, yeah."

        "And I think the other thing that really helped me was finding a community of people who are going through similar ordeals even if they do not have the same cancer as me.",
        "And I was never much of a social media user before I got sick.",
        "But what I found to be kind of incredible is this vibrant community of cancer patients who tweet, who blog and who write on Facebook, and it's really kind of an incredible thing.",
        "I think for a lot of people, you know, social media can feel like it eats up too much of your time or it can be a waste of time.",
        "But when you're isolated in a hospital room or you're bedridden...",
        "Yeah.",

        "This is something that is also in the mind of Max, another caller from Martha's Vineyard.",
        "And, Max, emotional health is also something, I guess, that you weren't prepared for in chemo?",
        "I was not prepared to feel so isolated.",
        "I was not prepared to be so afraid to, like the - like your guest was saying, so afraid to talk about what was going on.",
        "I didn't realize that being out of work - and I was in my early 30s at the time - I didn't realize that being out of work and out of the social sphere was going to make me so depressed.",
        "And I didn't have a family at the time.",
        "I was dating someone.",
        "I didn't know how to talk to him about it.",

        "Let me bring this back to you, to Madhulika Sikka, because we're talking about things that, like I said, surprised people about chemotherapy.",
        "Is there a way that a doctor or a hospital can prepare you for these things?",
        "I think, frankly, they do the best that they can, given the fact that most likely your doctor hasn't been through it.",
        "So if you - like they're giving you the benefit of secondhand reporting.",
        "You know, some hospitals have groups, support groups that you can get together with other people.",
        "I, unfortunately or fortunately, I did not need to use one of those because, sadly, I'm of an age where it seemed to me that breast cancer was sort of epidemic, and I knew so many people directly or someone who knew someone that I kind of could build my own support network.",
        "And what I did find was that once you're on the other side, the women who I had looked at who'd gone through it - and I saw it from the outside - they were so brave.",
        "They were so strong.",
        "But once you were in the club with them, they shared the things with you that you might not have known as an outsider.",
        "So you suddenly felt like, oh, I feel like this.",
        "And I would call up someone or email someone, and they're like, yeah, that's exactly what it's like.",
        "Or they would warn me about things that I would go through.",
        "I think there's no better substitute than talking to someone who has been in a like situation with you and the extent to which the doctors and the medical community can help put you in touch with people.",
        "I think that that's probably of a lot more benefit than the doctors.",
        "You know, the doctors have to be generalists because they are dealing with lots of different types of cancer, lots of different types of chemo, and all of them are a little bit different.",
        "So give us your status update at this point, Madhulika.",
        "Before we go, where does the - I mean, obviously you're writing a book.",
        "Things seem to be going pretty well.",
        "Where do you stand now with cancer?",
        "Well, I don't like to use the word survivor, and no one has ever used the word remission.",
        "One thing I did learn about cancer is it's all about odds, and you have to learn what somebody I know calls medical math, and you have to figure out your odds.",
        "And what the doctors are doing is helping you reduce the odds, once they have treated you, of it coming back.",
        "So I'm on medication right now which I stay on for five years after my chemotherapy.",
        "Five years.",
        "And hopefully, that's going to reduce the odds of it coming back.",
        "You just have to be vigilant and it sort of struck from nowhere, in my mind, not a history in my family.",
        "Who knows it may come back, but if it comes back, it's not because we haven't fought hard to try and keep it away.",

        "It's just a strange thing because I'm actually cancer-free right now but it's just really exciting.",
        "But because of a high (unintelligible) of relapse, I do a week of chemotherapy every month that I've - that I'll do for a total of a year.",
        "It's just, you know, I've been sick - I feel like, for so long, maybe (unintelligible) It's nothing compared to a lot of people."
