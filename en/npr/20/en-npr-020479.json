        "They have to speak to immigration, like we've been talking about, health care, climate change, student loan debt, income inequality.",

        "It's interesting that most of the leading candidates, according to the early polls, aren't on until the second night.",
        "And so I guess this first night is an opportunity for people to look at the other ones they haven't really heard much about yet.",
        "Well, I mean, I'd say that Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke are three people who have been leading in the polls.",
        "You know, if you go by that, that they're fairly big names.",
        "But everybody - you're right - wanted to be on stage with Joe Biden because he's been, you know, the so-called frontrunner for so long in this race since he's gotten in and because so many of them are making cases against him because they have a fundamental different view on how the country should be governed.",
        "You know, but tonight is an opportunity, I mean, for a lot of these candidates, for some of the ones you mentioned, you know, especially Elizabeth Warren, to stand out on their own.",
        "I mean, Warren has hustled.",
        "She's been substantive and has started to pass by Bernie Sanders in a lot of polls.",
        "So, you know, for tomorrow night, as Sanders is looking to square off against Biden, Warren is really somebody he's got a lot to worry about with.",
        "And, you know, she is going to try to command that stage tonight.",
        "Do you have the impression that Democratic voters are being given a truly wide range of choices here, or is it more a difference in tone?",
        "Joe Biden has tried to seem a little more congenial, a little more moderate, perhaps, than some of the other candidates and yet also insists no one should question my progressive credentials.",
        "Are they standing for fundamentally different approaches to the country, fundamentally different challenges to the president?"

        "But there's other efforts.",

        "You can go review that material, and you don't have to take notes because it's always there.",
        "And then when you go to class time, you can use that for something more valuable like a conversation or a project or some type of peer-to-peer learning.",
