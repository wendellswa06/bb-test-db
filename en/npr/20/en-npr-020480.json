        "And I discovered there was this whole world - this was at MIT - of people who just never went to class and just would use that time to do problem solving instead.",
        "And so for the most part, the ones were memorable were the ones where there was a shared experience.",
        "And - you know, there were some great orators, some great lecturers, some - that were inspiring, but it was good for moments.",
        "But it wasn't great when you were trying to dig deep into something, when you might be a little bit lost and you want to catch up when the class is going at a pace - you might be a little bit bored.",
        "You might know the material already.",
        "I think the shared experience of a lecture is great for inspirational things.",

        "I think those type of things can happen on demand at your own pace.",

        "He was using visuals along with his speech.",
        "And he was teaching us about socially constructed realities.",

        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "And was saying, you know, if you - if we all believe there was a cat here, then therefore it does exist.",
        "And it was really interesting.",
        "And so I found that incorporating visuals with, you know, speaking made it easier to remember, more likely to remember.",

        "But what I would say is that actually he should share those skills - and it sounds like he was humorous and all the rest - I mean that instructor should make videos, put them online, his students can access them.",
        "And then when they go to class, they can actually have that debate about whether if everyone believes the cat is there, whether it really is there.",

        "Physical geography, where my professor was teaching for the first time in America from China.",

        "That was the only bit that me and probably 175 other students caught for three-and-a-half-plus months.",
        "How did you do on the course?",
        "You know, that was about 12 and half years ago.",
        "I want to say I did pretty well.",
        "I enjoyed the class.",
        "But you know, honestly, I can' remember a lick of it.",
        "And I guess, Salman Khan - thanks very much for the call, James - that makes your point.",
        "Yeah, that's exactly - I mean, you know, most of us can't remember actually the courses we took, and I'm not that far out of college, but much less the actual content of a lot of it.",
        "And even when you were there, you know, running up to the final exam is - this is why there are so many students cramming, is that they've learned very little.",
        "They've gone through the motions.",
        "They feel like they're paying tuition.",
        "It's part of the, I guess, the ceremony of going to college, of showing up at these lectures because that seems to be what everyone else is doing.",
        "But I've actually found that the students that are most productive are the ones that use that time to go do something else.",
        "An email from Alan in Augusta, Georgia: Of thousands of lectures I've enjoyed, the best is no doubt Jack Pettigrew's \"\"Love is a Plastic State.\"\" I heard this as a student in his neurophysiology class in Caltech in 1975, but he delivered it elsewhere as well.",
        "The point was to discuss neuronal plasticity, how our brains change.",
        "And he illustrated it with numerous anecdotes, including how his brother-in-law lost his fear of a deadly snake while high.",
        "Jack really illuminated the subject, the impact of evolution on brain states."

        "I'm just saying that they could maybe be best used off - when we're not in a classroom.",
        "In a classroom you should do things like that, you know, expose people to new experiences, make them think about it, have a two-way conversation.",
        "I agree because in teaching mindfulness, I do have a didactic and then an experiential portion.",
        "And during the didactic portions, I do try to limit it to 12 minutes or so because I know what happens, and people don't pay attention.",

        "A lot of what we learn from is from conversations with other people.",
        "And that obviously can go on well beyond to 10 minutes or even an hour because you were actively engaged.",
        "Your brain is actively processing and thinking of new things."
