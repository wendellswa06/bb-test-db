        "And the Justice Department would have to go along so, again, not very likely.",
        "The second option, even more unlikely, is the House Democrats could arrest Barr.",
        "They could have the sergeant-at-arms go out and hold him; that hasn't been done in modern times.",
        "And it's not even clear where they'd actually hold him, because there is a bit of a myth about the House having its own jail.",
        "There's no working jail in the Capitol.",
        "And think about the political bomb that would set off so, really, almost impossible to think that would happen.",

        "That's a place Trump thinks he can win.",
        "And even if he doesn't, I mean, think about how long that process could take.",
        "It could take months, years - really slow things down for getting any information that Democrats want.",
        "And we're talking about this now butting right up against next year's election.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Let's talk about the president and his decision to exercise executive privilege over the report.",
        "How does this factor in?",
        "I mean, it all - it feels very stalemate-y (ph) right now.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, this is a president who's now using executive power for the first time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Lots of presidents have invoked executive power - I mean, some more than others and often involving investigations from Congress.",
        "But Trump's is pretty blanket.",
        "That's what's a little different about this one.",
        "It's for all of the Mueller report - for what hasn't been publicly released already.",
        "Democrats see that as going too far.",
        "They want access to the full report.",
        "They want the underlying evidence.",
