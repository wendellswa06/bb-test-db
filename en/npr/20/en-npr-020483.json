        "Wow.",
        "Give me some of that.",
        "OK.",
        "So that's a drug that can help you as well, according to the ad.",
        "But what an ad like that commonly does not list is how much the drug will cost - at least not until now.",
        "Yesterday, the Trump administration announced that pharmaceutical companies must include a drug's wholesale price in a TV ad if it costs more than $35 per month.",
        "The rule is said to go into effect this summer, but some drug companies are resisting this move.",
        "With us in the studio is Nicholas Florko.",
        "He's the Washington correspondent for the health news site STAT News.",
        "Good morning, Nicholas.",
        "Good morning.",
        "So consumer groups are thrilled about this new rule; the pharmaceutical industry, not so much.",
        "What is their argument against simply listing prices?",
        "Well, drugmakers say that because of insurance coverage that hardly anyone actually pays the price that the Trump administration is forcing them to include in their ads.",
        "That price is often called the list price or the sticker price, and drugmakers actually argue that consumers seeing that price could actually prevent them from talking to their doctor about a drug they might need out of a false assumption that they can't afford the drug.",
        "So I see the price on TV.",
        "I see it without my insurance.",
        "And I think, oh, I can't afford 500 bucks.",
        "But let me ask you something.",
        "Earlier this year, Johnson & Johnson started including the list price of a blood thinner in its television ads.",
        "They're the first company to do that.",
        "And how has that been working for them?",
        "How did they pull this off?",
        "It's been going well.",
        "I mean, frankly, it's a smart PR move.",
        "The Trump administration has been eager to shame drugmakers for their lack of enthusiasm over including list prices in ads.",
        "The Trump administration has actually said that drugmakers might be ashamed of their prices, but they've actually praised Johnson & Johnson at pretty much every turn.",
        "And during a presidency where a single tweet can send your stock tanking, that praise really goes a long way.",
        "And as I understand it, Johnson & Johnson has just put on TV what the drug costs and then what the drug costs if you have insurance.",
        "That's right.",
        "OK.",
        "So to be clear - this is a rule, not a law.",
        "How's it going to be enforced?"

        "Well, that's probably the most interesting part of this proposal.",
        "So the Trump administration actually doesn't have a way to enforce this on their own.",
        "Instead, they'll rely on drug companies to essentially police each other.",
        "Basically, if drugmaker X decides to comply - meaning, they put a price in their ads - drugmaker Y doesn't, drugmaker X can sue drugmaker Y over what's called an unfair trade practice.",
        "Basically, they're getting an unfair advantage because they're not listing their price in their ads.",
        "OK.",
        "So the president is shooting for interpharma (ph) competition to work this out.",
        "The pharmaceutical industry, as a whole, is very powerful.",
        "Are they going to fight this?",
        "They certainly are.",
        "They've pretty much signaled as much as they can that they're going to sue over this proposal.",
        "They argue that it violates their First Amendment rights.",
        "Basically, they say, we don't want to disclose this information; you don't have a compelling reason to force us to.",
        "And so it'll likely be fought out in the courts.",
        "First Amendment argument.",
        "Last question for you - the White House has been pushing for this, as you said, as part of this effort to lower drug prices.",
        "Do you think this is going to have that effect?",
        "It's an indirect try at best.",
        "I mean, the drugmakers have been very intent on sort of fighting this as much as they can.",
        "They could have already lowered their list prices.",
        "So it might shame a few.",
        "They might think a second about putting a high list price on their drug.",
        "But I would say it's probably not the most immediate way to do so.",
