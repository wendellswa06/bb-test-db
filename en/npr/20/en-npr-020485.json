        "Hi.",
        "Hi, Ira.",
        "Just love the show.",
        "And, Dr. Zon, I wondered if you were aware - I'm sure you are - of the story, which I only heard about on NPR in the last couple of days.",
        "And you'll forgive me.",
        "I've forgotten - I don't even think it was in the United States, and probably not because of the unfortunate backward policies that have caused some delay in our research.",
        "But the young - the very young, actually, baby - I guess it was in the first five days - was born and - either obtained or born with a virus which destroyed its - the young person's liver.",
        "They were - they had done some clearance work before in research, before and had approval to go ahead, and this was the first case, apparently, that it was appropriate, injecting a liver stem cell into the young person - injecting or placing, I don't know how it was - with a coating from an algae, which allowed the membrane of the algae to provide a protective coating against the virus but permeable still so that it could actually take over and support liver functions until the young person's liver is healthy enough to restore him to normal health.",
        "And I believe he's several months old.",
        "Are you aware of this, sir?",
        "Well, I'm, you know, I don't know that particular case.",
        "I heard a little bit about it, but not that much about it.",
        "It does illustrate how you can use a variety of cells and do transplantation and really affect things, affect organ function.",
        "And so we're just at the beginning of seeing how cell therapy can actually work, and so we see a number of studies to try to fix different heart disease and also, as you're illustrating, liver disease.",
        "I think that it's important that the people who are listening realize that some of these therapies are rational and have a scientific basis and should be done, and I believe what you're talking about was done in the correct - in a reputable institution.",
        "I also just want to say that we are very concerned about stem cell tourism, so you do need to worry about some company, let's say, that is telling you they'll fix any type of disease through a particular cell population.",
        "And very frequently, we find that that group of companies is trying to make money rather than actually trying to help people.",
        "Having said that, I don't know this particular instance, so it sounds very fascinating.",
        "But what you're saying is that as soon as someone, some company has a breakthrough in this and creates a real product, everybody else will want to join in on the bandwagon and starts investing more money and research in it.",
        "So you worked with the Handsome Boy Modeling School along with the RZA and De La Soul on their album, \"\"White People.\"\" And the track you were on was \"\"Greatest Mistake.\"\" Kind of a departure from the Handsome Boy Modeling School's style, which I loved but it can be kind of campy.",
        "So why did - why do you think that you working with them on that took them to a more sincere or grounded style?",
        "Let's go back to 1973.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)",
        "I think that's true.",
        "I mean, we go back to - if you think about IVF, and at a certain point in time, there was a large debate about whether this was ethical as well as whether it should be done at all.",
        "And then as soon as there was a baby, I think that entire debate went away.",
        "I think if you look at organ transplants in the early - in the '60s and '70s, there were a number of patients who did extremely poorly from organ transplants and a number of the doctors were heavily criticized by trying to do these types of procedures as, you know, it would never work.",
        "But then as soon as there was a success, the entire field became much more invigorated, and we were able to see how it could become an industry as well as it could become a standard of therapy."
