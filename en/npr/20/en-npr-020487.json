        "This is SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow.",
        "We're talking about the upcoming landing of Curiosity, scheduled to land on the surface of Mars this weekend, Sunday afternoon.",
        "And in the couple of minutes we have left talking with John Grunsfeld and NPR's Joe Palca, Dr. Grunsfeld, give us some idea of what the mission is.",
        "We've talked about the landing, and what is the mission?",
        "So the hard part is getting it down.",
        "But once we're down, then we start the marathon of science with the Mars - with the Curiosity rover.",
        "And as I said, this is a chemistry laboratory we're sending.",
        "It's a, you know, geologist's dream.",
        "The rover is the largest rover we've sent, and it's going to try and look at the question of, you know, did Mars once have an environment?",
        "We know there were warm, salty water flows.",
        "We learned that from the previous rovers.",
        "And from orbit, we've seen minerals indicative in this Gale Crater where we're landing, that there was water flows.",
        "So the question is, when there was water on Mars on the surface, was it the kind of environment that would be conducive to the formation of life, microbial life, or habitable?",
        "And are there any hints, molecular hints, that there might have been life on Mars during that period?",
        "And so we've picked this crater, Gale Crater, because it has the kind of stratigraphy, you know, the linear sedimentary rocks that we can see from orbit, that a geologist would go to to read back in geologic time.",
        "And so we'll be able to read back from essentially modern Mars all the way back, perhaps, three and a half billion years in Mars history.",
        "And sometime around two and a half billion years ago or so, some three and a half billion years ago, liquid water flowed on the surface.",
        "That's what we see.",
        "And during that period, you know, were the conditions suitable for life?",
        "And we can tell that from the minerals.",
        "And if there was life, there might be some kind of reduced carbon, some organic carbon signature tied up in the rocks, kind of a molecular fossil.",
        "Although nobody likes me to say the word fossil because it conjures up clams and trilobites, but we're not looking for that.",
        "We're actually going to crush the rock, break it up, put it into a mass spectrometer and analyze the types of different minerals and the isotopic ratios of the individual elements.",
        "We also even have a camera with a laser on it than can zap a rock, briefly create a plasma, and in that flash, that vaporized flash, read the light back and tell what kind of mineral it is.",
        "So it's really the tools a geologist would have, even a hand lens imager, you know, like a geologist taking a magnifying glass up to the rock to look at the grains and tell what kind it is.",
        "So we're going to go out and explore, and this is real exploration.",
        "Well, it all begins once you get down to the surface, and that's seven - after the seven minutes of terror.",
        "Yup.",
        "And it's going to take a few days to deploy the booms and the mast and get the cameras working and learn how to rove.",
        "You know, this rover has a little bit of a mind of its own, so we can tell it, hey, go to this place.",
        "Like the previous rovers before it, we have to learn how to operate it, all, you know, 250 million miles away.",
        "Joe, can you give us any idea?",
        "Is tension building up of people anticipating, taking bets at all?",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "No. Nobody - I don't think anybody is taking bets.",
        "You know, everybody has to deal with this in one way or another.",
        "They're trying to be relaxed.",
        "They're trying to be cool.",
        "But I mean, let's face it.",
        "As John Grunsfeld said, you know, you spend three or four, five or six years of your life building something, and it all comes down to these seven minutes.",
        "And it's just, you know, for the rest of us who work on things and then switch and work on something else, it's just really hard to fathom how much is riding on this and how anxiety-provoking it is.",
        "And, you know, really, there's not going to be any relief until about 10:31 Pacific Time on Sunday night.",
        "And the sad thing is it could even be longer, because the communications is tricky, and if the bent pipe that John Grunsfeld was talking about - that satellite has been having some issues, and it might not be able to send a signal.",
        "I mean, everything is looking good now, but they could be fine on the surface and not know it for several hours.",
        "So there is another little twist to this story."
