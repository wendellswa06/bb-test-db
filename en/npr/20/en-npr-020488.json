        "What if these producers start jacking up the price and our market dries up?",
        "What can we do if we can't be in the oil business at all?",
        "Chief executives of Exxon Corp., the parent, as early as 1960, said, we've got to diversify.",
        "So Exxon began looking into all kinds of side businesses - office machinery, information technology and nonconventional energy.",
        "That's where Lou Shrier landed.",
        "His first interest was biofuels.",
        "But then I kind of became enamored of solar energy, hearing some of this vision of people like Elliot Berman and others.",
        "And I said, gee, you know, we ought to look at this not just as a research activity, but get into it commercially.",
        "So Elliot Berman, the photochemist, set out to prove that solar could be a commercial success.",
        "It was the early '70s, and the world was his playground.",
