        "What has brought the two sides together in Shanghai today?",
        "Well, you have the meeting of the two leaders in Osaka, who agreed that they needed to start talking again.",
        "But what's remarkable is that the Chinese side, as you say in your reports - President Trump is talking this down (ph); so is the Chinese side.",
        "So there's this sense that both sides know that at some point this can't carry on forever, that this could be very, very damaging to the two economies.",
        "But neither side really seems to be anywhere close to the kind of concessions that might unjam this really nasty standoff.",
        "OK, so it sounds like, listening to President Trump there, he's just - it's not just playing an expectations game; I mean, it seems like pretty dim expectations overall for anything really big to happen here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We get a stream of pretty senior Americans out to Beijing here, and it's really interesting how very consistent the messages that Chinese leaders are giving them, and it's a kind of two-part message.",
        "One is that they don't actually believe that President Trump himself wants to destroy the Chinese economy.",
        "They don't even really believe that President Trump wants to decouple the American economy from the Chinese.",
        "So they don't think of President Trump, funny enough, here as the most dangerous hawk in Washington, for all that President Trump presents himself as this great kind of basher of Chinese cheating."

        "The figures that really worry the Chinese - and they tell American visitors this all the time - is the hawks that they see swirling around President Trump.",

        "And so you have this very paranoid mood here in Beijing at the moment.",
        "So interesting.",
        "So they think even if they were to work out some sort of deal with President Trump, they have this feeling that others in Washington would stop a deal from actually meaning much to the Chinese and making much of a difference.",
        "That's right.",
        "And one thing that's fascinating - I've actually sat in on a couple of kind of track-two meetings with former senior American officials who worked for President Obama when they met the Chinese.",
        "The Chinese have this line where they say, you know, we know this is all about American domestic politics.",

        "But then having said that very confidently, you know - you wait a couple of minutes - they go, he does need a deal, doesn't he?",
        "So you've got this moment where this autocratic, communist regime here is trying to play kind of political analyst and guess what effect American domestic politics has on President Trump.",
        "So they're really anxious people right now.",
        "But it's not just politics, or it is politics because it matters to a lot of voters in the United States.",
        "How much does it matter?",
        "I mean, if there is some sort of breakthrough, if there's a deal, will American farmers and others here and also people in China really feel the effects of a new agreement?",

        "In fact, the news conference with the medal winners included questions about du Toit.",
        "Ilchenko responded through an interpreter.",
        "(Through translator) What are you going to do as far as awarding her a separate medal?",
        "Looking at these people, just really looking at them inspires you, and once again, I have the utmost respect to her.",

        "She was 17 then and barely missed qualifying for the Sydney Olympics the year before.",
        "Just three months after the amputation, she was back in the pool learning how to swim with one leg.",
        "She tried again for the Athens Games and failed, but won five gold medals in the Paralympics, the games for disabled athletes.",
        "At her own news conference today, she said the new swimming marathon gave her another chance.",
        "For me, it's not about being disabled or about being able bodied.",
        "It's all the same to me.",
        "I get up, and I race.",
        "You know, I'm not in a campaign or anything like that, and it's just my personal dream and my personal goal, and to me, it's a dream come true.",
        "Du Toit isn't the first amputee or disabled athlete to compete with the able bodied in the Olympics.",
        "But it's rare.",
        "So mixing disability with ability in the games attracts attention and analysis.",
        "Chris Waddell has 13 Paralympic medals for wheel chair and track competitions."
