        "administration, who believes it should cease to be an issue to be negotiated?",
        "Jerusalem has been taken off the table.",
        "I mean, what exactly are we left with to negotiate?",
        "Well, this is the dynamic the administration has suggested it's trying to set up.",
        "And let's talk about this as if it were a cash deal rather than a giant negotiation.",
        "The administration is essentially saying, we used to be offering you a thousand dollars to settle, and you didn't take that deal.",
        "So now we're offering you $500, and you better take it before it's $200 or $50 or nothing.",

        "I just care that every single Palestinian whose life and his life prospects or her life prospects are blighted - they can't export or import a tiny object, whatever that object might be, without Israeli approval.",
        "They can't travel to see each other, to study, to do whatever they want without Israeli permission.",
        "This is the reality that Palestinians have lived in for decades - a prison - a big prison, sometimes with more comforts, sometimes with fewer.",
        "Do you see merit - do you acknowledge any merit in the basic Israeli narrative that they feel this is their historic homeland, that they came there after being oppressed elsewhere, that they've built a successful state and that they feel threatened by terrorist attacks?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "We find it hard, a lot of the time - or other Palestinians or Arabs find it very hard to buy when Israelis see themselves as threatened or as victims.",
        "But I accept and understand that this feeling is genuine and true.",

        "Well, you know, Farai, it goes back to 1957, when Ghana became the first Sub-Saharan country to gain independence.",
        "And, of course, you know, the British Prime Minister Harold McMillan had told the South African all-white then parliament that there was a new wind of change blowing across the continent and this was the first example.",

        "So there were Americans.",
        "There were - Thabo Mbeki from South Africa, even Robert Mugabe from your homeland was there with no real issues surrounding him.",
        "So it was a big party and it's going to go on for a year.",
        "And there are some people who you wouldn't say necessarily are party poopers.",
        "But they are wondering about something like $22 million that the country has spent on the party and are wondering would that not have been better served to address some of the continuing problems that the country has.",

        "But at the same time, Kufuor, as you know, is head of the African Union.",
        "And at the same time, Ghana has contributed forces to some of the conflicts on the continent and received high praise from the new secretary-general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-Moon.",
        "Well, that is a lot going on and we're going to keep track of it for the rest of the year.",
