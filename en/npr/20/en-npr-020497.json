        "But I suspected that that wasn't really true, and so I undertook to study, quote, high-functioning schizophrenia with Dr. Steve Marder, Amy Cohen and Alison Hamilton and others.",

        "So when I'm constructing an argument or responding to an argument and focusing on that, that's where my mind goes, and the kind of crazy stuff recedes to the sidelines.",

        "It's really helped me out a lot to have the gratification and the focus and the structure that my work provides me, and I work at a really great law school.",
