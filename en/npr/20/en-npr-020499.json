        "Our cases, as I said, most of them will not go before military commissions, and people are just going to be there indefinitely.",
        "What we're waiting on is for the Supreme Court to grant review for the third time to determine whether our clients have the right to go to court and challenge their detentions - their indefinite detentions without trial.",
        "And so this has some significance but not really very much, because most of our clients will never face one of these military commissions.",
        "The big question for us is can the government hold people in detention in an offshore penal colony without giving them any right to go to court?",
        "Well, tell us about the other nine, I believe, detainees who have been charged.",

        "Mr.�SHEHU SANI (Human Right Activist, Author): People who are indoctrinated are those who already have the seed of violence in them.",
        "They have the seed of hate.",

        "Indeed.",
        "Shehu Sani is also a human rights activist and he's an author, and has written a book about religious violence in Nigeria and terrorism.",
        "And the perspective he wanted to put it in was that he said for the past 30-odd years, young people who have been growing up, anybody the age of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and others, even though they may not have been involved in the violence themselves, they have probably absorbed this fact of religious of violence, Christian against Muslim, and then some radical Muslim sects, and this could have affected him.",
        "He said, you know, I can't say that he was radicalized in Nigeria, but certainly as a young boy in his early years growing up and in his early teens, before he went off to boarding school in Togo, this is the reality he lived.",
        "And that's, of course, the societal context.",
        "The family context, you paint a portrait of a young man becoming increasingly isolated from his family, as he found his faith in opposition to what his father did for a living.",
        "Indeed, but a family that is also very wealthy.",
        "His father is a very well-known and respected conventional banker in Nigeria, but - and also, everybody I spoke to said Alhaji Umaru Mutallab was equally pious, as pious and as a devout a Muslim as his son.",
        "But what we learned from the Internet postings of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, we're told by intelligence sources that these are his postings.",
        "It seems that despite the fact that he had an upbringing -somebody - a privileged upbringing, that more and more, he was conflicted between his life as a true Muslim and the Western life that he was living as a young schoolboy.",
        "And let's bring Dina Temple-Raston into the story.",
        "She picked up the story and went to London, where Abdulmutallab went to college at University College, London.",
        "Counterterrorism correspondent Dina Temple-Raston followed him there.",
        "The university where he studied was on MI5's watch list - MI5 the British equivalent of the FBI, concerned for some time that radical Islamists used college campuses to recruit and radicalize students.",

        "Yes, it's sort of the next step in Abdulmutallab's development.",
        "You know, and building on what Ofeibea did in Nigeria, we then see Abdulmutallab in a period in his life where he feels quite isolated.",
        "This is the first time that he is by himself in a non-Muslim country, and he's sort of reaching out, trying to find things that he recognizes.",
        "And very early in his time at the University College, London, he becomes the president of their Islamist Society, and the way that you become president is not by some sort of popularity contest, but actually people are voted into the presidency of this particular society at the university by being particularly pious.",
        "And apparently, he was very, very devout and spent a lot of his time going to prayer and knew quite a bit of the Quran, and these are all things that helped him gain that particular role.",
        "Yet that dichotomy, that tension within the family, illustrated by the fact in London, his home there, the family home in London in a very fancy part of town, in Regent's Park, and yet he attended a mosque in a storefront.",
        "Well, one of the mosques that he attended, indeed, was at a storefront.",

        "It had - on the street, there were Rolls Royces and Mercedes and BMWs just parked street-side.",
        "And what I found interesting is I spoke to some of the students in the Islamic society who knew him when he was there, and they said they didn't know he lived in this really nice place until they read about it in the papers.",
        "So he was very much living sort of a double life.",
        "And - double life - at one point, he puts on a project, a school project, based on Guantanamo.",

        "And these were people that he - we know from his postings that he was interested in some of these former detainees or people who were at the forefront of the Guantanamo movement.",

        "And there's a slight hitch in the chronology of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's tour here.",

        "I've been told - people, investigators and officials, believe that he met with al-Qaida operatives in the southwest of the capital, in the mountains southwest of San'a, and that he also is believed to have met with Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born cleric who is hiding there, being protected by his tribe, who has been connected, of course, with the Fort Hood shooting and this Christmas Day attempted bombing.",
        "And that is the final piece of his radicalization, his journey where, apparently, he was armed, trained and sent on his way.",
        "And Dina Temple-Raston, we just have a couple of seconds left in this segment, but he apparently encountered those lectures by the American-born cleric, al-Awlaki, online.",
        "Online, and then subsequently went to a mosque in Finsbury Park to actually hear a video conference in which he was giving a speech.",
