        "That, of course, is his birth date.",

        "All right.",

        "foreign policy, the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Middle East, Palestinian-Israeli crisis, how they felt so personally that the U.S.",
        "was attacking not only Muslims, as they felt, but even Nigerian Muslims, because Islam is very much a way of life.",
        "Islam is not just a religion for them.",
        "So if many Nigerians that I'm talking to now are speaking about that, obviously, that may have been how Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab felt.",

        "That's not part of our religion.",
        "Well, we'll get to Peter in just a minute, but there in London, Dina, that's apparently where he was asked the question: Are these just fantasies?",
        "Are these just ideas, or do you want to actually take steps in this direction?",
        "Right.",
        "He was asked this in some of his online postings, continuing on from what Ofeibea said.",
        "And what's interesting is that he sort of equivocated on that and said he didn't really want to answer that question.",
        "So he was clearly sort of going along a particular path.",
        "And I spoke to a recruiter when I was there in - or a former Islamist recruiter when I was there in London, and I had him take me around the Regent's Park mosque, which was one of the mosques that Abdulmutallab attended.",
        "He used to go there for evening prayers.",
        "And I asked him to tell me how the radicalization process worked.",
        "And in walking me through it, he said, you know, one of the things that recruiters were looking for were people who looked sort of - who felt isolated and alone and who'd already started down the path of how can they do more to be better Muslims."

        "He liked Yemen very much, and according to housemates who would talk with him before going to class there in San'a, he liked it specifically because there were so many Sunni Muslims there, so many people who lived very conservative, religious, pious lifestyles.",
        "And he felt very much at home there, and if indeed he was still nurturing these fantasies of a global Islamic society, then that would, in part, explain that.",
        "And I think in terms of his radicalization, it seems safe to say that at this point, it was fairly complete by his second trip to Yemen.",
        "In Dubai, before he came on his second trip, he had written to his family and said look, I've found the true religion.",
        "Don't try to contact me anymore, which follows on a bit from what Dina was saying, that perhaps he had bought into this argument that the more isolated he felt, the more of a true Muslim he had finally become.",

        "So how do we better - I mean, even if it comes to profiling, to protect our country, to protect our people, how do we do that?",
        "Well, Dina Temple-Raston has been involved in both those stories and looking into them.",
        "Dina, can you help us out here?",

        "And how do - and Facebook.",
        "And so it was very hard to track that sort of thing.",

        "And also if you shut down the Web site, how long does it take until another Web site opens up?",
        "And how was - they contacted him through hearing his remarks on YouTube and through Facebook, and so that's how they got directly in contact with him?",
        "Originally, although I think that was certainly what the Fort Hood Shooter, Nidal Hasan, Major Nidal Hasan, had actually originally met Al-Awlaki as an imam to the mosque that he attended in Virginia...",

        "Yes.",
        "There's a bit of a thread that I followed that involved al-Awlaki when I was doing my reporting.",

        "An expert on al-Qaida in Yemen confirmed that for me.",
        "And then several officials, both Yemeni and Western officials confirmed that there probably was a face-to-face meeting between al-Awlaki and Abdulmutallab in the fall.",
        "This would be a few weeks, probably, just before he left on his mission.",
        "And I'm also told by officials that al-Awlaki was much more active in those in the recent months.",

        "Well, he would be the only one that - well, there were two young men actually.",
        "I see what you're getting at with the question.",
        "There were two young men who were suspected terrorists that Abdulmutallab had some contact with.",

        "And part of the problem is that when they come into an Islamic narrative, there is a lot of fish mentality and they appropriate it from other communities like the one in Britain that feels as though they are alienated and marginalized from the dominant society, and they internalize those feelings to themselves.",
        "And that makes them more vulnerable to things like what we find happening with Abdulmutallab, because there's a pervasive rhetoric that's now existing in many Islamic circles that you are part of a larger Ummah, or community, worldwide.",
