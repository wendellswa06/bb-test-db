        "Sure.",
        "But it does involve disclosing to your employer, and you're right, there are risks to that as well, given stigma.",
        "What are the techniques you use to manage your anxieties?",
        "Well, fortunately I'm an avid - I love exercising, and that's one thing that my doctor, my - not only my primary care but also my psychiatrist has recommended to me to manage my stress.",
        "I've been doing that for years and years and years.",
        "And I - it's just one of those things that I can kind of shut my brain off, listen to music and, like, work out the stress, I guess, a little bit.",
        "When I used to work in an office, it was the kind of thing where I would go home at night and worry about my job.",
        "I wouldn't sleep because I would worry did I do everything right, did I complete this, is everything going to be OK tomorrow when I go in?",
        "And with the job that I have now, I - it's still a 9-to-5, but I'm in this - my house.",
        "I have an excellent job.",
        "Like my boss is fantastic, and while we speak every day, it's not like he's breathing down my neck or, you know, like watching to see - he trusts my performance.",
        "It's - and I don't have colleagues that are, you know, worried about my business.",
        "I'm here by myself, and it just - it works for me.",
        "And I am very, very lucky that I have this opportunity to be at home.",
        "I've been doing this now for three years.",
        "And Elizabeth...",
        "And I think the comment \"\"works for me\"\" is really, really critical, and there are different ways you can kind of negotiate the work world if you have a psychiatric illness, and it sounds like, Elizabeth, that you've really been able to do that.",
        "I might mention also that some of our subjects mentioned that exercise was one of the things they did to keep themselves sane.",
        "And thanks very much for the call, Elizabeth, and we're glad you can join us on the radio.",
        "Thank you so much, Neal.",

        "Today we're talking with Elyn Saks.",
        "She has schizophrenia.",
        "Decades ago, when doctors first delivered her diagnosis, they called it grave and told her to limit her professional aspirations.",
        "Though the disease has sent her to the hospital, to the pharmacy and into the analyst's chair, she's also successfully made her way into that most rarified of fields, the ivory tower of academe.",
        "Saks is currently a chaired professor at the University of Southern California's law school.",
        "She's figured out a variety of techniques that help her and others like her stay on top of the symptoms and focused on the job.",

        "He's with us from our bureau in New York.",
        "Nice to have you back on the program, doctor.",
        "Thanks, Neal, pleasure to be here.",
        "And I wanted to ask you, in your practice, yes there are people like Elyn Saks.",
        "How many?",
        "Well, as Dr. Saks said, probably very few.",
        "And part of the reason is these are individuals who are high-functioning and don't seek out treatment.",
        "You know, I want to return to something that Dr. Saks said, which I think is incredibly important, and that is physicians, psychiatrists often have inappropriately low expectations after somebody gets a diagnosis of a serious mental disorder like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and settle for function which is much, much lower than the person's actually able to achieve.",
        "And while everybody can't be Dr. Saks, with or without schizophrenia - she's extraordinary, and I'm a big fan of hers - it's still true, exactly what she said.",
        "And we know very little about people who are on the higher-functioning end of these illnesses simply because it's ascertainment bias.",
        "They never come to us in the first place.",
        "They don't seek treatment.",
        "Well, she certainly did, and forgive me, Dr. Saks, if I misheard you, but I thought I heard you say most people could do something like you do."

        "My colleagues and I, when we designed our high-functioning study, one idea was look at jobs like professional and managerial and so on, and the other was to look at what would have been expected of a person.",
        "So if everybody in your family is a bus driver, and you're a bus driver, that's total success.",
        "It's a little bit harder to design a study like that.",
        "So I'm not saying everyone can become a professor or a lawyer, but I think a lot of people can do well if we give them help.",
        "We just don't step up to the plate and provide the care.",
        "This is an email from Grant(ph): My name is Grant from Houston, longtime listener.",
        "Listening to your show on my way home, I had to pull over to email in.",
        "From 2010 to 2012 I went through a steep downward spiral into depression and anxiety.",
        "And of all the medications and therapy I went through, getting a highly demanding job was the number one thing that pulled me out.",
        "Having responsibility and people depending on me gave me a sense of self-worth and brought the light back into my life.",

        "Exactly, exactly.",
        "I mean, we are social beings.",
        "And, you know, you can't expect people to function well in a bubble, and simply giving somebody a medication to control symptoms is inadequate for treating any mental disorder, whether it's schizophrenia or anxiety or depression.",
        "But Dr. Friedman, some - a lot of people would say those same medications, at least at times, make it really difficult to function.",
        "Yes, it's a double-edged sword.",
        "I mean, all medicines have side effects, and there's a careful balance between the, you know, pros and cons of medication.",
        "But in general, I think when they're used correctly and the doses are adjusted, the treatment is far better than the untreated illness."

        "I've got good - a good run of 20 years as an environmental engineer for a regulatory agency.",
        "And in the last couple of years, what's really helped my life more than treatment, therapy was my involvement with the ManKind Project, which is kind of a nationwide smaller men's group.",
        "And that has been really helpful, just talking with other men about what they're going through and finding out that I'm dealing with things as well as I can.",

        "I love to do things.",
        "It's just for me, a lot of the help I need from therapists and other men is just encouragement, care and friendship and just listening and helping me move along through these little bumps in the road so I don't get down in these low points and stay there.",
        "And how much do you tell your employers?",
        "Not much.",
