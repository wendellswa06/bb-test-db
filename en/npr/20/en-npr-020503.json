        "You're welcome.",
        "All right.",
        "Just going back to the point that Dr. Friedman was talking about, this an email from Terry(ph) in St. Louis: I find even when you tell people what you have, they don't totally get it.",
        "I also have issues with those that don't believe we fall under the Americans With Disabilities Act.",
        "It's a hidden disability.",
        "There are still people who think it's your fault.",
        "Yeah, there's a lot of work that needs to be done that, you know, people who have never had the experience of having a serious mental disorder think that these disorders are nothing more than character flaws.",
        "It's something so far from the truth, that all someone really needs to do is get a swift kick in the pants and pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.",
        "They've never had the experience themselves or had a family member who had mental illness.",
        "But I wanted to return to one other thing that Dr. Saks said, which is that we do often have unrealistically low expectations, but at the same time I think we should recognize that there probably are a proportion of people who, even with all the encouragement, all the support, may not be able to achieve exactly what they expect or what we think that they should.",
        "And we should not push people beyond the point where they're comfortable and capable of actually functioning, that there are some individuals who really do have a very, very serious form of whatever the mental illness is, and we have to accept that they are there, and they exist.",
        "I think that's very important, and I should revise what I said and talk about most people, and not everybody...",
        "Right.",
        "...some people, as hard as they try - I wanted to mention another thing about stigma, which is it's possible to internalize it.",
        "So Glenn Close invited me to be on her board, Bring Change 2 Mind, and she did public service announcements with T-shirts that said schizophrenia, depression, friend of someone with depression.",
        "And she gave me a shirt that said schizophrenia.",
        "And I looked at it, and I thought, I don't wear T-shirts during the week, but I do on weekends.",
        "And then I thought, do I really want to wear a T-shirt that identifies me as having schizophrenia?",
        "And then I thought, but people wear bracelets and ribbons and shirts identifying themselves as cancer survivors with pride, without shame, with camaraderie with others.",
        "And we're just not there yet with mental illness, and it even affects people, you know, who have the illness."

        "Here's an email that we have: This - my story is about medication.",
        "I had to be medicated following brain surgery, and my brain surgeon actually came to work with me one day just to see how I was functioning.",
        "And the listener then asked: How many psychiatrists would do that?",
        "Few.",
        "Yeah.",

        "I'm actually - I work in the mental health field, but I also have a diagnosis that I received when I was 13.",
        "And so it's kind of an interesting dichotomy where it's - it gives me a lot of empathy for my clients.",
        "But at the same time, it's an additional stigma with, you know, a fear of, well, does it make me less qualified or more qualified?",
        "My experience has been that the skills that I've learned help me help my clients more effectively, but also the things that I observe and that they teach me help me manage my own symptoms more effectively.",
        "And I - in my field, you know, we always say - well, in the medical field, they say: Physician, heal thyself.",
        "And a lot of times, I turn that on myself, and I say, you know, use the coping skills you teach your clients.",
        "So the federal guidelines' range for sentencing Manafort in this case was 19 to 24 years.",
        "Right.",
        "And it's actually been, I think, the most rewarding thing to work in the mental health field because it does help me be much more empathetic and effective in helping people, because I truly understand what they've gone through and truly understand what they feel.",
        "And I think that that's something really unique, and I am fortunate to have the medication and the treatment history that's enabled me to be functional enough to do so.",
        "Elyn Saks, one of our earlier callers mentioned exercise.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, one of the big things that I teach my clients - I actually work on a day-to-day basis out in the community with clients to teach how to do basic living skills, how to do symptom management, how to live successful lives through financial employment - all of those things.",

        "I think, in some ways, being bipolar has served to create a bond of empathy between myself and congregants who, in the past, I've counseled and helped, and it's definitely been something that enables me to connect.",
        "But at the same time, when, as a manifestation of being bipolar, there's anger and other things that come out that are not consistent with my normal personality and people see that, they're confused.",
        "They're hurt.",
        "They don't understand it.",
        "So when that arises, it creates a real sense of betrayal or real confusion.",

        "We build a ramp to help people like that function successfully at work.",

        "Metaphorically, we need to build ramps for people with mental illnesses so that they, too, can have access to the same sorts of opportunities for the benefit of everybody.",
        "Sense of betrayal?",

        "You talked about a sense of betrayal."
