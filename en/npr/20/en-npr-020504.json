        "They get hospitalized or whatever and I mentioned migraines, but probably a better example would be someone who has vulnerable lungs with asthma or - and gets pneumonia once or twice a year and is out for a couple of weeks.",

        "We should treat mental disorders the same.",

        "Right.",

        "And, you know, in the case of something like post-traumatic stress disorder, it could take many, many, many months of, you know, going back and being exposed.",
        "If that's the sort of place and the sort of job that a person wants, then that's a highly valuable endpoint.",

        "But I think I only really came to terms with having the illness and being careful about how I structured my life, ironically, when I got on really good medication, because it made me realize that, you know, these chaotic and violent thoughts weren't things that everybody had.",

        "Trump is no longer the dominating personality that he was, but he's still the name leading in national polls and in most of the early states.",
        "Cruz, though, is the central figure in this particular debate if only because he was the object of most of the attacks from the other candidates.",
        "And he is masterful at slipping the punch, changing the subject, turning the criticism back onto others.",

        "Certainly not helpful.",

        "The sentencing judge takes a bunch of things into account when coming up with a sentence.",
        "The guidelines are just one of them.",
        "Ellis noted that Manafort was a first-time offender.",
        "He'd lived what he called an otherwise blameless life.",
        "He gave him 47 months, so three years, 11 months, also imposed nearly 25 million in restitution.",
        "He gave Manafort credit for nine months he'd already serve behind bars.",
        "And Ellis defended his decision, saying anyone who scoffs at this sentence should go spend a day in a federal penitentiary.",
        "(Laughter) But Manafort could end up spending even more time because there's another case against him - right?",
        "- that's still pending the sentence.",
        "That's right.",
        "That case is here in Washington, D.C.",
        "It's separate from the one in Virginia but related in a way.",

        "In D.C., Manafort pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges.",
        "He also agreed to cooperate with the government.",
        "That all blew up, though, earlier this year when the special counsel's team said that he lied to investigators about a number of things.",
        "The judge in that case ruled that Manafort did indeed lie about three things in total.",
        "The maximum sentence that Manafort faces in D.C.",
        "is 10 years.",
        "The big question hanging over this for Judge Amy Berman Jackson in D.C.",
        "is whether any sentence that she imposes on Manafort will be served simultaneously to the one in Virginia or staggered.",
        "So he could end up getting 10 years on top of what he got in Virginia."
