        "It showed that Democrats are divided over whether her comments were even anti-Semitic.",
        "They are divided over how aggressive lawmakers can and should criticize Israel and U.S.",
        "foreign policy towards Israel.",
        "And it also showed how uncomfortable a lot of Democrats were with how quickly Congress moved to rebuke a young African-American woman, one of the first Muslim women in Congress, especially when, you know - I've covered the place a long time - lots of members say lots of offensive things in lots of different occasions."
