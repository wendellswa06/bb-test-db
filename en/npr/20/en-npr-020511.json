        "I'll say that just before you and I spoke, we looked at the Web site for NOAA, and there is a tropical storm forming out there, tropical storm Lee, but it's not going toward the Gulf Coast area, thankfully.",
        "No, it's heading up into the North Atlantic, but it does come from off of Africa, where these major storms are spawned and head in our direction.",
        "OK.",
        "Why the increase in hurricane activity?",
        "Well, there are a couple of factors here.",
        "One--and this is really interesting.",
        "There appears to be a regular multidecade cycle of hurricane activity where for a period of, say, 25 to 30 years they're very, very intense, and that's followed by a few decades where you have a very few.",
        "So during the active period--and we are in one now--which scientists say started around 1995--you have very warm water coupled with low atmospheric winds.",
        "Now the water in the Gulf of Mexico is about 90 degrees, above 90 degrees in some places.",
        "The Atlantic Ocean water is well above normal.",
        "And we know that hurricanes feed off warm water, but you need more than just the warm water.",
        "When the winds are not very strong, they do not disrupt the formation of the hurricane.",
        "When you have an El Nino--actually, El Ninos prevent the hurricanes, because they have strong winds.",
        "We are not in an El Nino season, but we are currently in a period where the winds are not that strong.",
        "So you have the warm water and not strong winds to disrupt the hurricane.",
        "Ira, I think I've already seen in some places some cautions or people saying this is worse than a regular hurricane and it demonstrates that global warming is having an effect.",
        "There is the expectation that global warming may be making these hurricanes into really big killers.",
        "Dr. Kerry Emanuel of MIT just published a paper in Nature in which he analyzed the records of the past 50 years, and he found that the largest wind speeds of hurricanes have increased by 50 percent during the last five decades.",
        "And at the same time, the average water temperature has increased also.",
        "So you add the effects of global warning to the fact that we are now in that 25-to-30-years intense hurricane cycle and you've got a recipe for a period of giant powerful hurricanes.",
        "Thank you for that news, I guess, Ira.",
        "It doesn't sound very happy, but there you are.",
        "Don't shoot the messenger.",
