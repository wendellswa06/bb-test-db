        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...which occur with equal frequency in males and females.",

        "Those studies need to be completed.",
        "There is some concern about why it's necessary or important to give this vaccine to girls so young.",
        "Well, the thinking is that to vaccinate girls at that age would catch most girls before the onset of sexual activity.",
        "So the 11-to-12-year age range is thought to predate sexual debut, and the vaccine works best when the vaccine recipient has not been exposed to the virus yet.",
        "So it's really a question of whether the person getting the vaccine has been engaged in sexual activity.",
        "That makes it more effective if they haven't.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, it makes it more effective if they haven't been exposed to the virus, which they could have sexual debut and not be exposed to it immediately, but it usually happens within the first one to two years after onset that they do get exposed to these ubiquitous viruses.",

        "And I'm her mother.",
        "I'd like to think that she was always protected, but could she get the vaccination at this time after she's already been - had the virus?",
        "The answer is yes.",
        "The Merck formulation of the vaccine is what we call tetravalent.",
        "That means it addresses four strains of the virus.",
        "Two of the strains are the most prevalent cancer-causing strains, and the other two are the most prevalent strains associated with benign genital warts.",
        "If your daughter had dysplasia and was treated for that, it was probably caused by infection with one of those strains, and she could receive the vaccine and be afforded protection against the other three.",

        "It's nice to be here.",
        "Are parents accepting of this vaccine?",
        "The research that's been done to date indicate that the large majority of parents are very interested in having their daughters vaccinated with this vaccine.",
        "And there are some questions, though.",
        "People have objected to the idea -this is a sexually transmitted infection.",
        "Why should girls so young have to be forced to have this vaccine?",
        "Yeah, most of the objections - I'd have to say a relatively small percentage of parents that I've studied and other people have studied have objected to the vaccine on those grounds.",
        "There is some objection that has been - that, you know, that parents have stated around that issue.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You know, part of the reason - strategies that are age-based - in other words, you know, directing the vaccine in this case to 11 and 12-year-old girls - have been found to be much more effective than trying to do a risk-based strategy where we try to identify who's at risk and vaccinate them.",
        "Those strategies generally don't work very well.",
        "Partly identifying 11 and 12 year olds, as Dr. Rose was saying, is that it's not that all of these girls are going to have sex immediately, but that this will - is a way to make sure that all young women are protected from infection.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Robert Rose, let me go back to you for a second.",
        "This is a, as I understand it, a - you need three injections, a course of three injections, and it's not cheap.",
        "It's $120 a shot.",
        "That's right.",
        "The early clinical trials and later trials all involved administration of the vaccine in three doses, spaced zero, one and six months, I believe, is the regimen that was used for Gardasil.",
        "And in that way, a very high level of immunity is achieved, and it's quite durable.",
        "At this point, it's been followed out at least four and a half to five years, and sufficient protection is maintained over that period."

        "Hi, I love your show.",
        "Thank you.",
        "My comment is essentially that I think the biggest problem is that there's a hypocrisy going on with the concern is that, you know, these girls are maybe going to have intercourse more sooner or something of that nature because they're protected.",
        "But the issue is that if it was a vaccine that prevented breast cancer, I don't think anyone would object to it.",
        "And if there's anything we can do to protect our young women who - if they're going to have intercourse, likely aren't going to tell their parents about it and aren't going to get a Pap smear, which is the other protection for cervical cancer -we should do everything we can to protect them from getting the disease.",
        "Gregory Zimet?",
        "I agree with Curtis completely.",
        "I think the concerns that somehow getting this vaccine is going to encourage young women to have sex earlier I think is largely unjustified.",
        "There's no way to study it at this point, but we have evidence from related kinds of issues that that's not an issue of concern, in fact.",
        "Robert Rose, if girls get this vaccine, can they stop having Pap smears?",
        "No, and it's actually very important to emphasize that point.",
        "The vaccine addresses the two most prevalent strains of cancer-causing HPV, and that accounts for about 70 percent of cases of cervical cancer, which means that there's another third of cases that are not caused by those strains.",
        "So even if they're vaccinated, it will be very important for girls and women to continue to have regular Pap exams.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So that part is still vital.",
        "And as we continue, Gregory Zimet -we just have a few seconds before we have to go to a break - in terms of parental acceptance of this mandatory, a lot of people have problems with that.",
        "Yeah, and I think that's where a lot of the controversy has been stirred up recently is around some of the legislation that's been proposed around mandatory vaccination.",
