        "But the problem is we have a problem in Texas where private schools don't fall under the purview of the legislature for these issues, and private schools are not required to take the exemption.",
        "Additionally, we've seen examples with other vaccines that are currently mandated when a patient or a child when the parent doesn't have them inoculated, they have a safety concern or their child had a past reaction, it's been a hostile environment by the medical professionals down here where they've taken a heavy hand and thrown families out of their practices and won't treat them.",

        "This is a sexually transmitted virus, and so people are really concerned that it's going to be very difficult for them, if the mandate goes into place, to be able to opt out, and they're going to be forced to take something that they're not ready to, either at this young an age or not interested at all.",

        "While I don't approve of premarital sex - I've certainly done everything I can to instill that in my daughter - I still can't guarantee that she won't, and that's why I'm choosing the vaccine.",

        "And as you say, Dawn Richardson, the case - any cancers that might be prevented wouldn't have happened for another 10 or 20 years, yet there's every indication that this will prevent cancers.",
        "There is.",
        "But we also have to look at things in perspective -kind of backing up a little bit and looking at the whole picture.",
        "When you look at all the cancer deaths in the United States, cervical cancer represents .006 percent, and there are effective screenings and treatments for cervical cancer - granted, not for everyone, but we have limited healthcare dollars.",

        "Insurance companies have to cover in Texas.",
        "And we start looking at a prioritizing of healthcare dollars in this one area, and those resources are limited.",
        "This vaccine will not help any of the women who are currently ages 13 to 50 who will come down with cervical cancer.",
        "We need resources also to go into the low socio-economic areas where people are having trouble having access to care, getting better delivery of health care so they can be screened and treated for cervical cancer, as well as all these other issues."

        "We - each year we have 300,000 to 500,000 cases of moderate and severe dysplasia, and presumably, the vaccine would present - prevent upwards of 70 percent of those cases and reduce the need for surgery in that many cases.",

        "But that's not an insignificant number.",
