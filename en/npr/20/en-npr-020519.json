        "I was 23 when I was diagnosed and I think my family probably would've backed it as well.",
        "And if you had a daughter?",
        "Oh, no doubt.",

        "You know, honestly, would not matter to me as long as I knew she was protected from cervical cancer.",
        "Because now I'm at the point in my life what - you know, it's really something that I consider, and I'm very careful with my follow ups, and then make sure that I stay on schedule with the follow up for the PAP smears.",

        "There's, I mean, there are different, I mean this is an important issue -there's a vaccine for children's program, which does provide some funding.",

        "But there's some issue about the amount of funds in different states may cover it to different extents.",
        "I think it's really important to the extent that a vaccine's mandated that financing is in place so that all children, in this case, all young women can get the vaccine and they're not put in, in any kind of financial difficulty.",
        "I think to have a vaccine mandate without financial coverage is irresponsible.",
        "Robert Rose.",
        "I agree with that.",
        "I think an underlying reason for pushing for a mandate is to make the vaccine more widely accessible to the girls that need it.",
        "So I do think there's a lot - been a lot of effort to identify ways of funding the vaccine.",
        "Several states are talking about proving it at no cost to eligible young girls and women.",
        "So that's the idea behind, I think, the major behind the mandate."
