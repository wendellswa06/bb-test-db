        "Well, I began working on the Bulger case in July of 1990, working with cooperating witnesses and informants and doing surveillance, all of the various pieces that are fairly common in the organized crime investigative line, so to speak.",
        "And over the years, we worked in conjunction and sometimes in parallel to the Massachusetts State Police, the DEA and the Customs Department on this case, all with the U.S.",
        "attorney's office in Boston.",
        "Well, I would say that what happened was that because of the nature of informants within the FBI and the closely held - I should say confidential - identities of informants, I knew that there were people out there that had information that was going to be useful or historically useful, but I didn't know particularly until later on that he was an informant for the FBI.",
        "And that, effectively, people in your own office were working to make sure that your investigation never succeeded.",
        "Well, you know, it's not quite that way.",
        "It's - you know, my investigation was conducted in a pretty clandestine manner up until the point where it became a little bit more overt on the organized crime squad.",
        "But the number of people who knew what I was doing in 1990 was pretty limited.",
        "So, anyway, you were working, another office was working at different purposes, as it turned out.",
        "And, of course, it all ended up in Whitey Bulger bolting with his girlfriend, and the difficulties, the frustration must have been terrible.",
        "Well, it was pretty high, you know.",
        "And then when the various pieces of fallout started to occur in the years following, you know, and once he was gone, so to speak, he and Catherine were gone, then the frustration in not finding him was pretty high.",
        "But that didn't stop us from working extremely hard to do that.",
        "And I wonder, obviously, the terrible situation regarding the treatment of him as a confidential informant, that's one thing, but as you mentioned - and we talked with Ralph Ranalli a minute ago - the difficulties of catching him also a terrible embarrassment."

        "Well, you know, it - I think I would disagree some with Ralph about this, the ways in which this was conducted.",
        "The FBI has had a very intense group of people working on finding these two people, working all over the world with various leads and things of that sort.",
        "So I don't think it was age that caught up with him.",
        "I thought it was the inevitability of the fact that he was going to be making mistakes at some point and then, possibly in this instance, he stayed in one place too long.",
        "And what we're told is that there was a series of targeted public service announcements broadcast on programs like \"\"The View,\"\" programs watched by women the age, the same age as Catherine Greig, and that in fact those were what turned up the telling tip.",
        "That's what they're saying.",

        "So somebody, it sounds like it, is going to collect that money.",
        "As you - do you end this day with some satisfaction?",
        "Well, you know, when I got that phone call at 1:20 this morning from a local television station in Boston telling me that he'd been captured, I frankly was not surprised because my phone never rings in the middle of the night.",
        "So I knew exactly what it was when that phone rang, you know, at 1:20 a.m.",
