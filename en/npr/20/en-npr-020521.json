        "But I can say that the supervision is supposed to be in place.",
        "And - but there's only so much you can do when you have an agent having a direct personal relationship with an informant.",
        "You know, under the modern guidelines, meetings are supposed to have two agents present.",
        "Payments are supposed to be witnessed by a second agent.",
        "A supervisor is supposed to personally meet that informant on a periodic basis, I think every six months now.",
        "So there are some management, you know, efforts to try to rein in the possibility of somebody going bad, but the truth is that if you have a rogue agent, who in fact himself is a criminal - be rare - but if you have that, there's going to be almost nothing that you can do completely to stop it while it's in progress, until after the fact.",
        "Let's get a caller in on the conversation.",
        "Let's go to Nancy(ph), Nancy's on the line with us from South Miami.",
        "Yes, thanks for taking my call.",
        "I was very interested in this subject.",
        "About 30 years ago, I was already a lawyer, but I became a police officer with a well-respected agency.",
        "And at one point, I was assigned to guard a CI.",
        "And it developed in the course of doing that that the CI was involved with sex and obtaining drugs from her controlling agent, and she also faked a suicide and was injured.",
        "And I think they picked up the medical bills.",
        "I'm not really sure.",
        "And the other piece that I think is probably quite common is I ended up in trouble with the agency because I called the situation to their attention.",
        "And it led to a lot of trouble.",
        "I mean, the investigation went on for a really long time, and I think this was the period that your guests are talking about.",
        "There are a lot of incentives where the controlling law enforcement officer - these are expensive investigations.",
        "Once you have a CI, there's a real reluctance to let them go.",
        "There's a real feeling that you've got to kind of cover up for them.",
        "The reference to Janet Reno's guidelines, too, I think that's very appropriate, and she came to that conclusion, I'm pretty sure, because of her experience as the state attorney in Dade County, where I am.",
        "But just remind us, you say you were guarding a special informant, a confidential informant, and her handler was involved sexually with her and providing her with drugs, and you informed on him, and you got in trouble?",
        "Right, well, I informed on her.",
        "As it turned out, I signed an affidavit in defense of another agent who the CI had accused of some kind of improper behavior, and one of the things I said was this was no kind of CI.",
        "I'm not sure what her information was.",
        "But I talked about the drugs and the alcohol, the sexual relationship, the - you know, her general lack of cooperation with the guarding and so on."

        "But that was the point.",
        "How is it - how did she become the central figure of this very expensive investigation?",
        "And it shows how important it is, I think, in light of what your guests are saying, in Janet Reno's guidelines of how you have to keep reassessing this and how you have to keep bringing in fresh eyes, for example, the idea of having a second person there when you pay them and so on.",
        "I understand at some level you have that.",
        "But when you get into these big investigations - because this was one with wiretaps and so on and so forth.",
        "As they become more expensive, there is a risk that you're going to let the CI control the investigation instead of the officers controlling the CI.",
        "Oh, I just want to clarify one thing.",

        "So I think that the idea that that would be covered up is not a normal situation.",
        "Also, I'd like to clarify something just from a strategy standpoint.",
        "You know, it was made to sound as if - that maybe in the old days, the top echelon program 30 years ago or 25 years ago, the goal was to have great informants and you would be rewarded and promoted and get incentive rewards for great informants.",
        "The rewards in the FBI are for lawful convictions of gangsters, of dismantling criminal enterprises.",
        "And if you look at what the FBI has done in the last 30 years overall, not just an anomaly case like Whitey Bulger, but overall, during that period, dismantling America's La Cosa Nostra, the American mafia, at the same time - and other groups that were here, like the Westies in New York or the Winter Hill Gang, but also preventing Chinese, Russian, Albanian, African, Vietnamese criminal groups from gaining the same foothold in the United States that La Cosa Nostra had, that was able - that it was able to gain, controlling labor organizations and industries and having politicians, even senators and congressmen, in their hip pocket.",
        "Those days were over and that was largely a result of FBI investigations with Department of Justice prosecutions.",
        "Now, in the FBI, those successes are the result - most convictions are the result of electronic surveillance, of wiretaps.",
        "The ability to get a wiretap requires the probable cause that's going to be furnished usually by a criminal informant.",
        "So you need wiretaps to get convictions.",
        "You need informants to get wiretaps.",
        "You need people on the street trying to develop informants in order to obtain the use of them.",
        "Now, an additional guideline, if I could add, is to tell an informant, if you do criminal activity and you're not authorized to do it by us, you will be arrested.",
        "You will be convicted.",
        "We will not come to your aid.",
        "And that's something - that warning or admonition has to be given to an informant on a regular basis.",
        "It's documented.",
        "It goes into the informant file and should be witnessed by a supervisor or a second agent when it's done.",
        "And that's a key issue.",
        "In order for a criminal informant to actually be able to engage in criminal activity, he has to be authorized.",
        "And that authorization comes from the FBI.",
        "It's reviewed by management.",
        "Often reviewed by the U.S.",
        "Attorney's Office and, of course, it'd have to generally - you don't have them engaging in murder conspiracy or things like that, but you're letting them get a little bit into the organization, as far as into the criminal conversations, into the discussions, and then provide that information so that you can disrupt the act before it actually occurs, before someone else gets hurt.",
        "And the number of times that that's been happened, the number of situations that I was personally involved in where confidential information by an informant that was allowed to be in the discussions where they were plotting to kill somebody enabled us to know who they were going to kill and oftentimes when and where and how and then the FBI was able to step in and prevent the actual murder.",
        "So again, the idea of informants being off to do whatever they please is just not the situation.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "And you absolutely have to have them if you - especially if you work in narcotics, but also other areas.",
