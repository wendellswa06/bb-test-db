        "It's important to consider one's methods in advancing even the most of noble of causes as we recognize slavery was deplorable.",
        "But I don't think he was all bad.",
        "I think that even committing violence and in the right cause is - I mean, it's negative, it's extremely negative, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the person himself is bad.",
        "It doesn't make him a terrorist.",
        "But, you know, it's touchy.",
        "It's very touchy, I suppose, but it's - I mean, it's important to consider, of course, that sometimes people go too far in, you know, even the best of circumstances - or not circumstances but the best of - for the best of causes.",
        "So it's very touchy to sort of determine whether or not he was in the right, but I think he had the right idea, although I believe that in - at that time, the sort of pacifist abolitionist had the right idea, you know, as we can take a lesson as we all should from the late Martin Luther King, Jr., that is non-violence probably - you know, it was the most effective way to get rid of segregation.",
        "I think non-violence was the most effective way to get rid of slavery at that time.",
        "But I can easily understand how someone would be driven to acts of violence by a sort of - you know, being frustrated with the lack of progress, especially someone who sees that as a intolerable, intolerable sin.",
        "Not merely lack of progress, Calvin, but as John Brown put it, and as Tony Horwitz mentioned, he considered slavery a form of warfare against the people who were enslaved, and it is not simply status quo.",
        "There are people whose lives are being ruined every single day.",
        "I understand...",
        "Yeah, Tony, go ahead?",
        "Well, I mean, I think the caller really hits it on the nail.",

        "But slavery itself was a really - a regime built on violence and fear, and the country was entirely complicit in it.",

        "But I was struck by something a Brown scholar said to me, which is imagine it's 1938, and somebody could do a suicide bombing that would kill Hitler but also kill 50 or 100 innocent bystanders.",

        "Interesting email from Hobart(ph): Something I did not know until I just looked up his photo: John Brown was a white man.",

        "Brown has always been revered in the African-American community.",
        "He worked closely with black abolitionists, such as Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, W.E.B.",
        "Du Bois, Malcolm X, many other black leaders through our history have invoked John Brown.",
        "But yes, he was a white man.",
        "I'll also mention that he didn't have that famous scary beard of his until the last 18 months of his life, when he had a price on his head and went underground and needed to disguise his identity.",
        "For really the first really 57 years of his life, he's a clean-shaven, rather well-groomed conventional American striver who wore dark suits and starched white shirts.",
        "So I think in many ways our image of John Brown is distorted.",

        "All right, thanks for calling.",
        "I was wondering also, so I'm glad you asked that question.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, if we define terrorism as an illegal act of political violence that's intended to have a psychological impact, I think Brown fits the bill.",
        "He seeks to strike terror into the hearts of white Southerners, first in Kansas and later at Harper's Ferry.",
        "You know, fear is his greatest weapon, but I think it's a mistake to think of him as a terrorist in the way that we think of terrorism today, which has come to connote Islamic extremists or domestic bombers like Timothy McVeigh, who kill thousands of innocents, often towards rather murky ends.",
        "Brown does not target innocents.",
        "He does kill indiscriminately.",
        "In fact, he treats his hostages at Harper's Ferry very well.",
        "And he has a clear target: the institution of slavery.",
        "So absolutely he uses fear.",
        "He sheds blood in the cause, in his cause.",
        "But I don't think we should sort of lump him with terrorists as that word has come to be understood today.",
        "Let's go next to Mark(ph) and Mark with us from Wichita.",
        "Hey, Neal, thanks for taking my call.",
        "Tony, great book.",
        "I really appreciate the detail that gives so much more to this topic.",
        "I grew up here in Kansas, you know, went to the capital many times to see what's going on there.",
        "John Steuart Curry's great work with John Brown, 12 feet tall, the enraged look on his face with a rifle in one hand and the Bible in the other.",
        "And it really - I can't say that I have the answer either.",
        "Is he a terrorist, or is he fighting for the great cause.",
        "But really my question came - I read your book, and my daughter came home from eighth grade American history, fascinated by the story that John Brown had severed the trigger fingers of the folks, I guess it - was at Pottawatomie, the raid there.",
        "And that seemed to be her takeaway, as opposed to, you know, this broader question of what was he?",
        "What did he do, and how did that affect us all?",
        "It's really fascinating.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, well, Pottawatomie is a very brutal attack, and because they're using broadswords, you know, there is mutilation, and what's not clear is whether that was intentional or whether the people they were slaying raised their arms and hands and therefore, you know, were cut up, you know, badly because of that.",
        "But I think your point about the John Steuart Curry, the famous Depression-era mural with him with the Bible in one hand and the rifle in the other, that's the quintessential representation of Brown as this, you know, sort of possessed religious fanatic.",
        "On the other hand, I think it's an example of how strongly he fits into great currents of American history.",
        "Violence runs through all of our history, as does religious fundamentalism and race.",
        "This - he's really a quintessential American in many ways."

        "Right.",
        "I think the time here in Kansas when he was alive and the other raids and the whole issue of bleeding Kansas - the Kansas-Missouri Act or Compromise, whatever that was - with so many other things going on at the same time and the way life is, you know, out here on the plains, it was a rough existence for him for many years, I think, too, leading up to his ability to do what he ended up doing at the end of his life.",
        "Well, I think the Kansas story is very neglected.",
        "Here, really five years before the first battle of Manassas in the Civil War, you have organized units of Northerners and Southerners killing each other over slavery, sometimes in open-field combat with musket and canon.",
        "I think it's also forgotten that the Kansas-Nebraska Act and all the political ferment around that is what created the Republican Party.",
        "It's... originally known as the Anti-Nebraska Party.",
        "So this is really a crucial event in our political history as well, but I think outside of Kansas, most Americans - and I know I was myself - are fairly ignorant about what happened there.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Fascinating also to know that he was kind of an insider with Thoreau and (unintelligible) on the other side of the country.",
        "Mark, thanks very much for the call.",
        "You bet.",
        "Tony Horwitz, why did you decide to tell this story?",
        "I've been a Civil War nerd since boyhood, but I think like most Civil War buffs, I've tended to focus quite narrowly on the 1861 to 1865 period, the great leaders and battles.",
        "And I don't think we explore enough really how and why it is that Americans, who shared a common language, for the most part, a common religion and culture and history came to slaughter each other by the hundreds of thousands in the 1860s.",
        "And I think John Brown's raid is a window into that.",
        "But really, more than that, it's just a thrilling story.",
        "Brown, we've been talking about him, but he was not a lone gunman.",
        "This was a full-blown conspiracy, with all the suspense and sweaty terror that's involved in that.",
        "And I really got caught up in the story of his followers, his fellow soldiers, how this all happened and unfolded.",
        "They include his financial backers, the so-called Secret Six, and, as you point out, five African-Americans who went along with him on the raid."

        "Exactly.",
        "This was an exceptional occurrence.",
        "Abolitionists tended to love black people in the abstract but were quite condescending.",
        "They thought blacks were too docile and even inferior to fight for their own freedom.",
        "Brown really rejected that.",
        "He really lived his beliefs, and he felt it was a moral and military necessity that blacks and whites fight together to overthrow this system.",
        "And he has five black men in his band, and as we mentioned earlier, Frederick Douglass and others helping him behind the scenes.",
        "So this is really quite an unusual bi-racial guerilla movement in its day.",

        "He's always there bothering us.",
        "And I think in a sense that's his best role, almost, as an irritant.",

        "Tony Horwitz, near the end of your book, you cite the speech that Frederick Douglass, who of course knew John Brown, gave in Harpers Ferry in 1881.",
        "It's a good question, though, I would reframe it.",
        "I think Brown has a huge impact.",
        "In fact, I would argue that Abraham Lincoln would not have been elected without John Brown, but it's not because of Kansas.",
        "It's because of Harpers Ferry, which happens in October 1859, Brown's raid, which is in the early days of the campaign for the Republican nomination.",
        "Not unlike today, although their campaigns were very different.",
        "And at that stage, Lincoln was really a second tier candidate.",
        "I wouldn't quite call him a Rick Santorum, but he was certainly not the front-runner.",
        "He would probably have ranked fourth in the Republican field, but he very deftly uses John Brown's raid to position himself as the safely-moderate choice in the Republican field.",
        "People are very alarmed by this raid.",
        "They're terrified that the nation is plunging towards division and war, and Lincoln says - he really condemns Brown.",
        "He says this is not what the Republican Party is about.",
        "We're not about violence.",
        "We're not about opposing slavery in the states where it exists.",
        "We're about opposing the expansion of slavery.",
        "So he really uses Brown as a foil, and, one, it helps him get the Republican nomination, but it also divides the Democratic Party in a way that really paves Lincoln's way to the White House.",
        "The irony to this story, of course, is that it's Lincoln who ends up fulfilling Brown's dream with the emancipation proclamation."
