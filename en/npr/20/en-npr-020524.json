        "I think then and now, the question of John Brown's sanity is a way of really marginalizing him, of saying he's - this is the product of one man's fevered imagination, and therefore we don't really have to be that troubled by it or take it that seriously.",

        "Well, I think as you said, he's gone through a seesaw.",
        "He's - every era has had to reinterpret this man.",

        "And I would argue one of the best in American history.",
        "And he says that, you know, if John Brown didn't end slavery, he began the war that ended slavery.",
        "And he expressed his discomfort with the violence, but said it was really necessary payback for the violence against African villagers hundreds of years ago, dragging people to America and all the brutalities of plantation slavery.",

        "Well, getting back to the saying - always remember you're a Madison - when emancipation came and the slaves were free and no longer under the threat of being separated through being sold away from each other, they recognized that there were some inspiration in the name that for the first time, they recognized the importance of being a descendant of a president.",
        "And the importance was that they have blood of this great man in their veins, so they, too, should achieve as much as they could.",
