        "I had 14 months to reflect on the error or my ways.",
        "There is an aspect of this that I think most people don't understand is that that - did you feel ashamed of yourself for getting captured?",
        "No, not - not really.",
        "I think what was surprising to us was not that the embassy was captured because it was a time of great ferment and turmoil in Iran.",
        "What no one - none of us, I think, expected was the things to play out the way they did, where what started out as essentially a '70s student (unintelligible) turned into this 14-month international crisis, which just seized the attention of the world, seized the attention of the country and brought down an American president, and continues to cast a long shadow right down to the present day.",
        "Indeed, it does.",
        "But how much of that were you aware of when you were in captivity?",
        "Not much, actually.",
        "We were cut off from news.",
        "We had no newspapers, no radio, no television.",
        "So, we had glimpses of it from here and there, but a very little sense of it.",
        "And when - even when you were put into solitary, presumably, after the failed rescue attempt that doesn't (unintelligible).",
        "Actually, it's before that.",
        "Before that, I must have impressed them as some kind of bad character being cause for - for whatever reasons they had, they said, no, no. We have to put this person in solitary.",
        "And at that point, were you completely out of touch with your fellow hostages?",
        "No.",
        "You get pretty inventive.",
        "You find ways.",
        "You pass - develop ways of communicating surreptitiously.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "I suppose, again, this is one of those things that every prisoner finds, he becomes creative and inventive; and communication, obviously, in that situation like that is extremely important.",

        "There were moments, yes.",
        "There were moments.",
        "Most of the time, I think you would say people - you're fighting boredom and you're fighting your own self-created fears, but there were a few times that things got pretty dangerous.",

        "He was held for 11 months after being kidnapped from his home in the small Russian region of north of Ossetia.",
        "And he joins us now by phone from his home in Geneva, Switzerland.",

        "Your experience was a little bit different.",
        "Well, everybody's hostage experience is a little bit different.",
        "But tell us, briefly, what happened to you?",
        "So, I was managing a humanitarian operation in north Caucasus for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the body guard, the armored vehicle.",

        "It was a time where there was a war in Chechnya.",
        "We were delivering food aid and assistance with the region.",
        "But today, they want you.",
        "I mean, those guys are well-equipped on all that.",
        "So, a group of people will go to me.",
        "Abandon me in the trunk of a car and spent three days in the trunk of the car.",
        "And then they took me in captivity inside Chechnya and stayed in - stayed in the house for 11 months.",
        "For 11 months.",
        "And during that time, were you well-treated?",
        "Well, the beginning was rough.",
        "It was violent interrogation, 45 minutes every day for about 12 days.",
        "And the violence ended.",
        "Then somehow, I discovered afterwards that maybe the violence, you know, that we're seeing me because violence (unintelligible) at least maybe a form of dialogue.",
        "You're a bit powerless.",
        "It's an imbalanced dialogue but it's a form of dialogue.",
        "Then I was in a cellar, handcuffed, and I had about 15 minutes of light every day.",
        "So, in other words, it was totally, totally dark.",
        "So, I had a candle for those 15 minutes to eat my soup and a loaf of bread.",
        "And that was all forced.",
        "It's very difficult to describe, and a sort of depths(ph) in loneliness that you develop on the sort of survival strategy or coping strategy, you have to find in order to approach each day as a new day, not having much chance at the beginning to find out whether it was day time or night time.",
        "And you have to keep the mind busy and at the same time not too think too much, so a bit difficult.",
        "Did you ever think - did you ever miss that dialogue you were talking about so much that you thought of, you know, trying to prompt another round of interrogation?",
        "Thank you."

        "Some refused to contact, some wanted to chat two, three minutes, but it was never longer than that.",
        "And, I was trying to get some news; could not get news.",
        "And then, you know, they closed the door, the trap on the - you end up with all your questions mark - should - do I have told them these, should have said that, should have been more polite, should have been more aggressive, only that you don't know what works because the guards were changing, so it was difficult to find out what was the right communication strategy with them.",
        "John Limbert, is that sound familiar from your experience?",
        "It sounds very similar.",
        "Vincent, we - someone once told us after this that, in a situation like this, the worst thing to do is they say is you, you could not should on yourself, meaning, you can't say I should have done this or I should have done that.",

        "That you've chosen the wrong options.",
        "Did you find yourself from time to time thinking a lot about your family, the people you left behind or did you try to drive that from your thoughts and say, all right, I need to focus on how to get out of here and how I'm going to survive?",
        "No, exactly, you try, I mean, for me, I try not to think too often about the relatives, solely - that was one of the main challenge; not too think about the beloved one, and get the mind busy on some other tasks, so all sorts of games, mental games; playing checkers against myself, praying, translating sentences in different languages, trying to memorize photo in the family photo album, the moments before the pictures were taken, the moment after - keep the mind busy constantly.",
        "Keep the mind busy, John Limbert, that's good advice?",
        "It's very good advice.",

        "Yeah.",
        "All of the sudden, I was no longer a commodity to trade.",
        "We managed - and managed to pull the right string.",

        "It gave a very scanty account of what had happened from, basically, from the wire services, but it said, there had been - I was able to pick up - there had been a rescue attempt.",
        "It had failed somewhere out in the dessert, in the Iranian dessert, and that there were casualties.",
        "And that was basically, all I knew until we got out and learned more about it.",
        "The effect, of course, was two fold.",
        "One, I was very sort of full of admiration for the people who had the guts to try something so difficult and so dangerous, disappointment and sorrow at the loss of life, disappointment that it end, of course, disappointment that it hadn't happened but a kind of reassurance that, in the fact, we were not forgotten about, and that someone was willing to embark on something so difficult and dangerous to get us out.",
        "I remember, wondering, at the time, I was only 11, wondering at the time worrying about you guys even as a kid, man, I (unintelligible) that they made this attempt and it failed, what's going to happen to them, and so I just want to ask you that question, so thanks for your time, for the comments."
