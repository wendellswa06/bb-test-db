        "Nevertheless, for 11 months, did you think - did you worry sometimes that they just thought you'd vanish into a black hole and you'd never hear from anybody ever again?",
        "Well, not really, I knew that the family would be mobilized and, you know, the colleagues would be mobilized, but I knew also, at the end of the day, my employer would not pay the ransom those guys were asking for, so I wasn't sure what sort of solution could be worked out.",
        "On that time, the Russian troops were no longer in Chechnya.",

        "And do they find it helpful or not helpful to, actually, like, one of your guests said he was attempting to memorize different things and to vocalize or to just be quiet and talk to your self because of perhaps concerns about how your behavior would be, you know, your captors would react to that?",
        "And, I can take my answer off the air.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thanks for the call, Helen.",

        "I took some of their favorite revolutionary anthems and made up my own verses.",
        "They didn't like it.",
        "I'm sure they didn't like it, but part of the game we played is they couldn't - they pretended to ignore it because if they had come back to me, then I would have known I was getting to them and that would have been a little victory.",
        "But I kept after them that way.",
        "It sounds like you've kept a sense a humor through all this?",
        "Well, you have to.",
        "You have to because the situation is so ultimately absurd and it's not - things are not suppose to work this way.",
        "And so, you know, people react whatever works - people react in different ways, but you have to see the absurdity of the situation just to keep your sanity.",
        "And did you see absurdity, Vincent Cochetel?",
        "Absurdity?"

        "Before the last session, I asked him whether I could ask him a question, and he said yes.",
        "And I said, do you have kids, and he said, how do you know, I said, whatever noise in - above my head, on the upper floor, so there seems to be a kid who is sick, was a bit serious that the guard would have reported on (unintelligible) his family composition or whatever.",
        "I said, what have you keep guard.",
        "He said, well, he's sick and all that.",

        "When you say kinship, not really, I mean, I have often said in statements that what they did was disgraceful.",
        "And before we could have any kind of dialogue or talk, I have no particular desire to meet any of them under the circumstances.",
        "But before, they - before, really, a dialogue could start, one has - they would have to face up to what they did and simply say, this was a mistake, this was a terrible thing we did.",
        "Hmm.",
        "You could now go back to Tehran, if you wanted and meet with them?",
        "No.",
