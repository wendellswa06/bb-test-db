        "And you go to a place in your brain, you know, like an animal because, you know, on jobs when people are at work, they think, oh, I wish I could leave here but then you always can, you really can but to be held against your will, there's nothing that most people don't really ever experienced.",
        "Could you imagine what it was like, again, you said it was for a few hours?",

        "The thing what I learn at the end of the day I think it's like (unintelligible) is dead.",
        "There are not that many things that matter in life.",
        "There are really important things, I mean, there was a radical shift of some of the values when I came out.",
        "John Limbert, what do you think you learned?",
        "Agree.",

        "Well, we have finished the immunizations of healthy adults, and we're now proceeding to test the vaccine in older adults who are healthy but over the age of 65 as well as in children.",
        "And how does this vaccine differ from the regular flu vaccine that many people get at this time of year?",
        "Well, it's really more similar than it is different, except, of course, that instead of containing the usual B, H1 and H3 that are in the typical flu shot, this shot contains H5, which is a kind of virus that causes bird flu."

        "There really is no close relationship between the kinds of flu that we get every year and that are in the regular flu shot and this bird flu virus, and that's what makes it so dangerous.",
        "The bird flu virus, in terms of its antigens--the outer surface--is a very different animal than the regular flu viruses we're used to.",
        "And if officials do decide to go ahead with the vaccine that's being tested right now for the bird flu, how long would it take before that vaccine is available?",
        "Well, this year, honestly, they were a team that should have probably fallen apart last year.",
        "They probably shouldn't have won.",
        "They had a bunch of rookies in the lineup and on the pitching staff, and they somehow won again because the Mets had not yet ripened into the team that they became this year - the juggernaut.",
        "The Phillies certainly had not become the team that some people had expected, and the Marlins had yet be blown up and built up again.",
        "So last year really was a little bit more of a fluke than most of the Braves teams we were used to when they won 14 straight.",
        "Here's an e-mail we got from Larry in Queens, NY.",
        "The only possible response to the end of the Braves' streak of division titles, he writes, is let's go Mets.",

        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And Alan, to what degree is the achievement of the Atlanta Braves - again, incredibly difficult to do in this era of free agency - but is it dimmed by the fact that amid all those championships, they only got one world series championship?",
        "No, I don't think it has dimmed at all.",
        "I mean, certainly everyone in my business has talked with a lot of the long-time Braves, whether it was Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine while they were there or John Smoltz, who's still there - Chipper Jones.",
        "We've all talked to them about, you know, how proud they are or should be about winning all those titles and yet only coming away with one World Series ring in 1995.",
        "And I think that it's an example of how much the playoffs really is a crapshoot, okay?",
        "That's not a very popular thing to say.",
        "Everyone likes to revere the Yankees for having won so many championships, and of course they earned them.",
        "But a 162-game test of the regular season is really a lot more telling than a three out of five in the first round of the playoffs, or a four out of seven in the league championship series - which is where the Braves have typically ended their seasons for most of the past six years."
