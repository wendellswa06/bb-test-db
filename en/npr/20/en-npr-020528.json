        "Yet somebody would point out that a team that didn't even exist when the Braves started this run, the Florida Marlins, has won two world championships.",
        "Yeah, they have, but the thing is that look at what they've done for their fans.",
        "I mean, they have won the two world series in 1997 and 2003, but almost immediately blew up those clubs and started over and had a terrible vibe around the stadium.",
        "And so I think that certainly if you're a fan of baseball, you would much rather have been a Braves fan over the past 14 years than a Marlins fan over the past - whatever it is - 12 or 13.",
        "And one of the extraordinary things about the Braves' run is that they have managed to accomplish it with a payroll considerably south of that of, say, the New York Yankees, who have had a comparable run, really.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "The Yankees - no one can compare their payroll to the Yankees.",
        "It's just foolish to do so.",
        "I mean, maybe Boston could have for a few years, but it's just in a different stratosphere.",
        "The Braves for most of the 90s and the first several years of this decade had one of the top five payrolls in baseball, sometimes among the top three - usually two, three or four.",
        "And so that had a lot to do with their success, of course it did.",
        "They were able to retain the Chipper Joneses and the John Smoltzes and, you know, sign Greg Maddux to long-term deals when other clubs like say the A's or the Twins would never have been able to do that.",
        "And that's, of course, what the Yankees have been able to do by keeping their best players and getting the best players from other clubs.",
        "John Schuerholz - the general manager of the Braves - did it more by trades, perhaps, than some other clubs.",
        "But he also had the good fortune of a significantly high payroll, particularly for the National League.",
        "As you look at the strength of the Braves organization, and of course that's down in the minor leagues as well as up on the major-league level, and the - well, the maturation.",
        "They are playing a lot of very young players this year.",
        "Do you think they have a chance to get back on top anytime soon?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I think that the Mets - this is the year for the Mets.",
        "As people probably know, they went out and got a lot of veterans: Carlos Beltran, Carlos Delgado, Pedro Martinez, Billy Wagner, Paul Lo Duca.",
        "These are mostly guys - except for Beltran, I suppose - who are in their mid to late 30s, and the clock will be ticking.",
        "Next year is probably going to be their last really functional year as a unit.",
        "Meanwhile, the Braves are being built mostly on young players: Jeff Francoeur - who was the pride of Atlanta last year -Adam LaRoche, Brian McCann, some other pitchers.",
        "And so, while I think the Mets have to be considered the favorite for next year, certainly the Braves and their emphasis on player development - which John Schuerholz and his front office have always emphasized - they're going to be in a position to be as dominant.",
        "Perhaps not as dominant as they have been over the past 14 years, but they still, I think, are the class of that division long-term.",
        "And I guess we should point out that the Braves - at least theoretically - could still make the playoffs as the wildcard team.",
        "But even though just about everybody in the National League seems to be in the wildcard race, the Atlanta Braves are not among them.",
        "That's true.",
        "I think they're about four or five games out.",
        "And you know, it's certainly - it's very easy to say, okay, that the Braves oh, they're only four or five games out.",
        "But they have about five teams to leap-frog over, so it's just not going to happen, almost certainly, for the Braves this year.",
        "It would be virtually unprecedented.",
        "I've now checked the standings, and in fact the Braves are five games out behind six other teams in the National League.",
        "So it ain't gonna happen."

        "The snow and the ice have receded and there's this rocky terrain with just scattered sheets of ice.",
        "Five years ago, Dr. Thompson estimated that at the current rate of retreat, the snows of Kilimanjaro would be gone by 2020.",
        "He is just back from his most recent trip to the mountain and he stands by this earlier prediction and says there is a noticeable decline in the ice ever since he's been there, even since the 2000 trip.",

        "It is a stark reminder that glaciers all over the world from Antarctica to Alaska are retreating, melting, as the Earth warms.",

        "Well, it's certainly on track.",
        "My guess, in just doing a visual comparison between these aerial photographs is that some of the glaciers like Fiertwanger(ph), which is in a crater, is probably lost somewhere between 30 to 40 percent of its mass since 2000.",

        "We've drilled, you know, for example, in Southeast Alaska on Mount Bona-Churchill to 460 meters depth.",
        "And the length of record that's archived in these glaciers, these mountain glaciers in particular, really depends on the location; not so much on the thickness, but on the temperature of the ice at the ice/bedrock contact.",
        "Mm hmmm.",
        "If it's frozen to the bed, time cannot be removed, so on some of these glaciers out of Tibet and down in the Andes we can get quite long records spanning over 100,000 years of climate history from these areas.",
        "And in the ice itself, the places we drill are the highest mountains on Earth.",
        "And the reason we do that is it's where it's the coldest, you have less disruption of the archive.",
