        "Well, remember that you start with the virus that you would like to make a vaccine against--in this case, a bird flu virus.",
        "And then you need to grow that virus in some substrate that lets you make tons of it.",
        "And what we use nowadays are embryonated hens' eggs.",
        "But not to get overly fixated on that, there are other ways that you could grow lots of flu virus in different kinds of cell culture that are also being explored as potential ways to make the vaccine.",
        "But that whole step is just the step of making the raw material from which the vaccine is then made.",
        "So after you've inoculated your millions of eggs and harvested the fluid from the eggs a few days later and now you have a liquid that has just lots of flu viruses in it, you now have to inactivate the viruses chemically, split the virus apart into its components and purify the parts that you want to include in the vaccine, which are two very important proteins called the hemagglutin and neuraminidase.",
        "And after you've purified those proteins, you need to concentrate them into the concentration that you want to use, add the various other ingredients that are part of the flu vaccine, put it in the vials that you want to put it in, label everything and then start distributing that vaccine.",
        "Why is this method seen as outdated?",
        "Well, the only thing that's outdated about it is that it's what's been used for the last 50 years with a series of adjustments and improvements over the years, although basically it's still the way we did it 50 years ago, although the reason we've used that process for such a long time is because it works extremely well.",
        "Now there are some problems with using eggs for flu vaccines, the most important one of which is that's an agricultural product that you might not have available when you need it.",
        "The roosters have to do their thing in order to have enough embryonated hens' eggs to start making vaccines.",
        "There would be some technical advances in terms of using cell culture instead.",
        "It would be easier to ramp that up and produce that on shorter notice, probably, than it would be to corral the giant numbers of eggs that you would need to make vaccine.",
        "And that's probably the biggest advantage of cell culture over eggs.",
        "I'm wondering with all the advances in biotechnology why we can't do it all in petri dishes.",
        "Well, in part it's because flu viruses--again, you need to start out with something where you can make many, many copies of those flu viruses in a very efficient system, and it just so happens that influenza viruses like to grow in embryonated eggs, and it's been difficult to come up with a cell culture substrate that supports the growth of those flu viruses as efficiently as they can grow in eggs.",
        "So from an economic and feasibility point of view, it's been very hard to beat embryonated hens' eggs as a substrate for making that raw material.",

        "So speaking as a historian, tell us what prompted that observation, what you mean by it.",
        "People often take Nelson Mandela as an example of somebody who was a terrorist and evolved into a great, widely respected statesman, which is actually historically wrong, because the ANC, the first 60 years of its existence, practiced nonviolence; at a quite late stage, by which time Nelson Mandela actually went to prison, switched over to fighting a guerilla war, which some people may not wish to confuse with terrorism.",
        "And then it was only after the failure of that guerilla war against the South Africans that the ANC decided to practice both sabotage, and then finally went over to bombing attacks in supermarkets and so on."
