        "Oh absolutely.",
        "And the changes to them?",
        "Yeah, and as a climber I hear stories, just anecdotal stories from my friends coming from all over the world.",
        "In fact, when I first approached a friend of mine named Lindsay Griffin, who lives in Britain and maybe the foremost authority on just what's going on in the mountains around the world, he writes a column for High magazine, or used to.",

        "...yeah.",
        "I mean Lonnie could probably answer that question better than I.",
        "Well, you can go to some of these like the Calkia(ph) Ice Cap where we have studied since 1974.",
        "And it used to be we'd go down there in the dry season, which is the cold part of the year, and there would be no water coming out from that glacier.",
        "In the last 10 years that we've gone down there, there's practically a river coming out by the campsites.",
        "And it flows year- round.",
        "So you can see dramatic increase in the water coming from many of these glaciers."

        "What is that?",
        "Well, when we started, we were a bit naïve.",
        "We thought we could just bring a drill from Antarctica and a power system and be able to get that up to these high elevation sites.",
        "And we first attempted that on this Calkia Ice Cap down in the Andes of Peru, only to find that it was impossible to move such heavy equipment up to those elevations.",
        "So, we had to come up with a new way to recover ice and that meant designing a lightweight portable drill system and also designing new power sources.",
        "And we've used photovoltaic cells to provide power for drilling, particularly in the tropics.",
        "And, when you think about it, in these areas you have over half of the earth's atmosphere below you.",
        "So these panels actually produce 20 to 30 percent above manufactured specs for power output.",
        "Mm hmmm.",

        "There's no noise, it's a silent drilling and there's no pollution to the site, so...",

        "Just a magnificent place to begin with.",

        "And Lonnie and his team, by the time, had been doing this, they had their big success on Quelccaya in 1983.",
        "I met him in 1987, so that's, you know, 14 years later or something.",
        "By that time, they had just worked it out to the purity of a dance.",
        "And they knew before the even left Ohio exactly what they were going to do with the ice when they brought it back.",
        "They had figured all the details out how not to touch it with anything except rubber gloves.",

        "And it was absolutely silent because of this solar power.",
        "So it was just a magnificent setting.",
        "Now, you as a climber have a real appreciation for how these scientists--the effort it must take to go up and down these mountains with the equipment and just to go up into this what you call the Death Zone and work up and down a mountain.",

        "He then went off--he was home for only 10 days, left for the Himalayas where his crew lived for 35 days at a location 2,000 feet higher than Sohama, 23,500 feet, and broke the record for high altitude ice coring they had just set on Sohama.",
