        "Lonnie, why do you do what you do?",
        "Why do you subject your body to, you know, the rigors?",
        "What is driving you, I guess is the question I'm asking?",
        "Well, I think the--it is just the excitement of discovery, of new things.",
        "And we have, over the years, gone to places where other people haven't gone.",
        "And if you do that, it almost ensures that you're going to find something that no one has seen before.",
        "I also have a lot of respect for the mountains.",
        "And I believe in today's world where we have so many interruptions in our thinking process--I know when I'm at the university, between, you know, the cell phone and the regular phone, the fax, the email, that the time to be able to really think about something gets disrupted.",
        "When you're out in the field in one of these isolated places, I think often you can see things clearer or you can think clearer about things.",

        "The question I had was when--are the glaciers solely reacting to climate warming?",
        "Or are they actually possibly slowing it down, like ice in a glass of water?",
        "And when they're all gone, might we see a rapid increase in temperature?",
        "I think that's a very important point to make.",
        "When we think about the glaciers and what's happening to them, a lot of heat in today's world is going into melting them, be they the mountain glaciers that we have been studying or the polar ice sheets or the arctic sea ice cover.",
        "So, a lot of heat is being taken up in this process.",
        "So, if you think about the glaciers, you know, they're one of the balancing mechanisms that we have for the climate of the earth.",
        "And as they become smaller, they are less effective in that."

        "Our number, 1-800-989-8255.",
        "Dr. Thompson, is there a place you would like to go that you haven't been able to get to yet?",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Great show.",
        "And we haven't pursued it because we know there's a lot of melting taking place there.",
        "But one of the things that we have thought about is, you know, whether you can interpret a record in today's world using today's techniques is one thing.",
        "But if you were to recover that ice before it disappears, and it will very shortly, maybe 20 years from now we would have the techniques, the technology, the understanding, that we might be able to actually use that archive.",
        "But there are a number of places around the world where I believe that very important records could be obtained from the low latitudes.",
        "Well, why is it that you think that mountain glaciers hold the key to global warming?",
        "Well, first of all you have to look at the earth as a whole.",
        "If you look at where the surface area of the planet occurs, 50 percent is in the tropics between 30 North and 30 South.",
        "And that's where the heat that drives the climate system is absorbed.",
        "This is where water vapor is pumped into the earth's climate system."

        "And it's also the place where we have major climatological phenomena like El Minos and monsoons and monsoon variability that impact people.",
        "If you look at the number of people, you know, we've got about 6.5 billion people living on the planet, 70 percent of them live in the tropics.",
        "So, this is a huge area that's really under-represented when we look at our histories, our paleoclimate histories of the past.",
        "And it's an area that we know in the last 100 years that climate variability coming out of the tropics impacts the whole earth.",
        "So, it's an area that we need to understand both the natural climate variability and also the human cause for variability.",
        "When you work with an ice core, and we talked about them having layers like tree rings, how far apart are those rings?",
        "And how easy is it to separate one ring from the other if you're working on it?",
        "Well, again, it depends on the site, the annual accumulation of snow.",
        "But for example, on this Quelccaya ice cap, the largest tropical ice cap on earth, there is three meters, 10 feet, of snow every year.",
        "So that's the separation in the layers.",
        "So, you can almost look at the weekly changes in such a record.",
        "And that archive is annual.",
        "I mean, you can see those annual layers back over 1,500 years.",
        "So, in an area like that you get a very high resolution record but usually not as long.",
        "Some of the other sites we drill, like in western China, accumulation may be of the order of only 20 centimeters a year.",
        "And you don't get the resolution, the annual resolution, from those records.",
        "But what you get is a very long history.",
        "And our oldest record comes from the Glee(ph) ice cap in the western Kudo(ph) Mountains covers over 750,000 years.",
        "So there can be really long archives if the accumulation is low and it's very cold.",

        "And I just became fascinated with them.",

        "Yes, it's not a drill bit you're going to get it Sears, is it?",
        "No.",
        "That's for sure.",
        "You want me to do that one, Lonnie?",
        "Lonnie, why don't you tell us how you do that?",
        "Well, I need to point out that I've been very fortunate.",
        "We have a wonderful team of people, and that team includes engineers, and we actually design our drills.",
        "And we use two different types of drills.",
        "One is an electromechanical drill, which physically cuts the core, it cuts the ice, and it retrieves cores of a length of about 1.6 meters."

        "So is it like a pipe with teeth on it?",
        "I guess that's what we're trying to envision, what it looks like.",
        "It's a lot like an ice screw.",
        "It's a hollow, it's got threads on the outside, and it's hollow on the inside.",
        "Right.",
        "And it has a way of holding itself steady in the hole.",
        "They're called anti-torque skates.",
        "Anyway, it's kind of hard to describe.",
        "But he drops it down, he pulls them out one meter at a time.",
        "He's just making a little hole in the ice.",
        "Okay.",
        "It's not anything that destroys much.",
        "There's some shavings from the coring process that end up on the outside of the screw, but he's just pulling up little core segments, one meter at a time.",
        "And he just, over the course of months, works his way to the bottom of a glacier.",
        "Okay.",
        "That's the other challenge, particularly in the tropics, is how do you keep it frozen to get it back to the lab?",
        "And we've worked different ways to do that, depending on what country we're working in.",
        "But for example, if you're working in Tibet, you have to remember, we move six tons of equipment into the drill site, and when we're finished we bring out ten tons, four tons of ice, frozen ice.",
        "And while the ice is being drilled, we have a cave, we dig a cave into the glacier where the cores come out of the drill, they're put into a plastic sleeve and then they're put into a cardboard tube.",
        "And they're stored in this cave up until we're finished.",
        "Then we use sleds, they're man-hauled from the drill site to the edge of the glacier.",
        "If you're in Tibet, you have to move it from the edge of the glacier down to where the trucks are, down in the valley.",
        "And we use yaks to do that.",
        "And to give you an example, a yak, you can get two insulated core boxes, you can get six meters of core in each of those boxes, so twelve meters per yak.",
        "And we recover five to six hundred meters of core, to give you an idea of the herd that's required to move it down to those trucks."
