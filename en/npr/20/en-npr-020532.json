        "And then there's a dash across Tibet to the nearest freezer, which happens to be in Lassa, where we can store it until we can arrange the air cargo to move it from Lassa to Beijing, where we clear customs.",
        "And then we air cargo it to Chicago, and in then it's trucked in a freezer truck down to the storage facility here at Ohio State University.",
        "So sometimes these cores can be in transit for a month from the time they leave the drill site.",
        "And I should point out that once an airline that shall go unnamed lost some of Lonnie's cores, but he managed to find them.",
        "And I would say that, well, Lonnie's colleague, Mary Davis, thinks that actually getting the ice cores off of Galathea was probably the hardest thing they've ever done in their lives.",
        "Wow.",
        "I mean, the story of how they did that, it ranks with, you know, Shackleton and Scott for what they went through, getting that stuff off there.",
        "That's some story.",
        "Yeah",
        "Driving it across this desert.",
        "You know, anyway.",
        "That's interesting.",
        "Lonnie, what message do you most want people to take away from your research?",
        "I think that what we have strove to do over the years is to build this database, this global database from these ice cores that document natural change and the change in the 20th century, and the documentation of the loss of these glaciers, these archives.",
        "I mean it's, we already know, for example, on the Kilimanjaro, had we waited until 2006, rather than 2000, to drill those cores, we would have lost the only timeline that we had of a recent event, which happened to be the Ivy test, the Chlorine-36 from the thermonuclear bomb test back in 1951, '52, that left a mark on the surface of that glacier.",
        "That was 1.8 meters below the surface in 2000.",
        "We have lost, on that ice field now, over two and a half meters since 2000, and hence we have lost that timeline that would have gave us a starting point for that climate record.",
        "So this change is real, it's global and we hope that these facts will in some way be able to work their way into national policy and action, that we will have to deal with the issue of a warming world and the impacts of that warming world on water re-supplies and the ability to produce food in different parts of this planet."

        "I would say outside of Lonnie's team, he's probably the most prominent scientist in the book, because in the course of telling the story of Lonnie's career, it was first of all necessary to talk about what's going on in climatology.",
        "And then of course the biggest thing happening in climatology right now is global warming.",
        "And Jim Hansen has been basically ahead of the pack, making accurate and conservative predictions for 30 years now.",
        "I did a little looking today, and I see that it was in 1981 that he first predicted something that he said just, you know, in December, which got him in a lot of trouble, but he's not really changing his tune.",
        "And I think both Lonnie and I agree that, in fact, Dr. Hansen is more conservative.",
        "I think Lonnie has a more dire view of what's going on right now then Jim Hansen does.",

        "Jim Hansen is not yelling loud enough?",
        "I think he's conservative.",
        "You know, in his December talk, I mean he talked about the tipping point in the climate system, and his best estimate is that we maybe have ten years before we cross this tipping point.",
        "And I'm not sure that we're not closer.",
        "Yeah, Lonnie, would you mind talking a little bit about this evidence from the plants on Kalkiya(ph) that you found, you uncovered in 2004?",
        "That's kind of relevant to this, I think.",
        "One of the things that is very telling is, as these glaciers retreat, they're releasing things that they have captured in the past.",
        "And along the margins of the Kalkiya Ice Cap there are plants, wetland plants, there's no woody tissue.",
        "But these plants are perfectly preserved and they're coming out from the retreating margin of that ice cap."

        "And these plants date, we've collected in 25 different sites around this glacier, and these plants date between five and six thousand years in age, Carbon-14 dating.",
        "And the only way that you could preserve these very fragile plants is to have them covered with ice for that length of time.",
        "And that tells us that for that ice cap, it has not been smaller than today for over 6,000 years.",
        "And so that kind of gives us, starts to give us a perspective on the current climate change that we're seeing.",
        "Yeah, we've seen evidence, even in North America in Alaska, of artifacts are now coming out of the permafrost.",

        "The ones you discovered in 2004?",

        "Dated in two different labs, they are over, to be Carbon-14 dead they have to be over 50,000 years in age.",
        "But what we're looking for is to see this in other valleys along this ice cap to confirm that there's not something unusual about that collection site.",
        "And just briefly, Lonnie, where are you headed next?",
        "We're headed to Nanu Nami(ph), in the far southwestern Himalayas.",
