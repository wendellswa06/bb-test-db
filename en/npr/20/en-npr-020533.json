        "The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has been a low point for the World Health Organization.",
        "That epidemic is still not over.",
        "There was an uptick in cases last week across the region.",
        "But the way the WHO has handled it has led to a push from both inside and outside the agency for dramatic restructuring of the international health body.",
        "NPR's Jason Beaubien reports.",
        "The missteps of the WHO in the early days of the West African Ebola outbreak are now legendary.",
        "The organization at first was dismissive of the scale of the problem.",
        "Then, it deflected responsibility for the crisis to the overwhelmed governments of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.",
        "And finally, once it stepped up to take charge of the Ebola response, it lacked the people and funds to do so.",
        "Ebola was the WHO's Hurricane Katrina, its moment of failure.",
        "The WHO director, Margaret Chan, recently admitted her agency was unprepared for the epidemic.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)",
        "And it overwhelmed the capacity of WHO.",
        "And it is a crisis that cannot be solved by a single agency or by a single country.",
        "But maybe a world health body that had sufficient resources and staff could've solved it.",
        "In the wake of Ebola, Chan late last month announced a plan for the most sweeping reforms of the WHO since its founding in 1948.",
        "The overhaul would change the focus of the WHO from a technical body that offers advice to an operational agency capable of responding to a health crisis in the field.",
        "The proposal would also create a $100 million emergency fund and a cadre of pre-trained doctors, nurses and epidemiologists that could be rapidly deployed during a crisis.",
        "In order for the world to be prepared for the next pandemic, even Chan says her agency must change.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)",
        "We always say that we go to war with a virus.",
        "But the world is not as well-prepared for epidemic as they are for war.",
        "Georgetown University professor Lawrence Gostin has been both a longtime critic and supporter of the WHO.",
        "He welcomes the reform proposals, saying they address the agency's deep structural and financial problems.",
        "WHO has a global mandate to be the global leader in the world.",
        "But their budget is significantly less than the budget of, say, the U.S.",
        "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is only one country.",
        "So the amount of their budget is wholly incommensurate with their mission.",
        "Much of their budget, roughly 80 percent, is already earmarked by member states for specific health projects.",
        "This leaves very little discretionary cash to tackle plagues and emerging new pathogens.",
        "After the 2009 swine flu pandemic, a WHO commission called for almost all the same reforms that are currently being floated in Geneva.",
        "Those earlier recommendations went nowhere.",
        "But Gostin at Georgetown believes Ebola was a wake-up call, not just for the WHO, but for the international community that maintains the agency."

        "But Ebola was such a black eye for the WHO, he thinks there may be an opportunity right now for reform.",
        "But my prediction is that it will be more at the margins and that it will take, alas, another major disaster to really drive this process of reform forward against the interests arrayed against it.",

        "Now with Dr. Kearse, it's suddenly different in that we have, you know, a well-established family lineage that we can link to another lineage - it being the European lineage - and so what we're doing here is just applying the techniques that we've used in the Roots Project for a number years to unraveling the connection between the African lineage of James Madison and the European lineage of his brothers.",
        "That sometimes entails making a genetic end-run in which we've done and - determining that who are James Madison's descendants who never came to the United States.",
        "And we think we've established that.",
        "And so hopefully, over the next few months, we'll be able to identify those Madisons in England and hopefully, one in the United States where we can actually compare the Y-chromosomes, which if they are from James Madison should be identical.",

        "You have to have the consent of anybody who is receiving the DNA test.",
        "That's a pretty rigid law in the United States.",
