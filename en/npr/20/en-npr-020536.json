        "I must make one more statement, though.",

        "Emotions were very, very high.",

        "And Nicki and I had probably met before in debates and things, I'm not too sure.",
        "But when I went into the green room that night, Nicki was sitting there, and normally I would've gone over and put my arms around her and hugged her and told her I was sorry about these people that she loved that she lost.",
        "But because of the position that I was in, I didn't do that, and that's a very great regret of my life.",
        "And this dialogue taught me how to respect the person, without respecting the position.",
        "And so we - over the years, we've developed friendships among the women who are involved in this dialogue, and I think that's helped lower the rhetoric and actually helped to forward a civil conversation - at least in this area on this issue.",
        "And Nicki Nichols Gamble, let me follow up and ask you.",
        "At that point, since you guys were the - appearing on the media programs, the people being asked for quotes, the people that the reporters turned to after such incidents, do you feel - is that the way, in effect, that you feel that you helped to ratchet down the situation?",
        "Yes, I think the Boston Globe, in fact, commented a year after our dialogue had started that they had noticed a reduction in demonization.",
        "A much more civil dialogue was taking place in Boston, and I think we deserve credit for a substantial amount of that.",
        "I know that I was - I really did change, not only how I spoke about people, but I changed how I thought about them.",
        "Fran alluded to the incident in which we met on the day of the killings, and I wouldn't have let her hug me, you know, if she had wanted to because I had no connection with her other than sort of a deep animosity.",
        "That has changed remarkably.",
        "It did change, and it has remained changed for 11 years now.",
        "At the same time, Frances Hogan, you say you respect the person but not the opinion.",
        "How long can you go in a dialogue before approaching the irreducible, that vast gulf of disagreement?"

        "I mean, we were doing this for about six years.",
        "And it finally came across to us that there was an enormous chasm between us, not just relating to abortion but almost complete differences in views of the world; the role of the human person in society, the role of law, you know, what our responsibility is for the other person.",
        "So we did come to understand that we had completely different world views, and there was a large chasm, but we wanted others to hear what we were saying.",
        "From the pro-life perspective, I can tell you that I felt that this allowed us to be heard in places we would never have been heard before.",
        "And so lowering the rhetoric helped politically, so to speak, even though it was also good to have civil discourse in general.",
        "And would you agree from the pro-choice side?",
        "Well, I think one of - one of the most important differences Fran has mentioned today, and that's this question about whether you can respect a point of view that is dramatically different from yours on something as profound and fundamental as the question of abortion.",
        "And I think actually the fact that I am able to both respect her point of view and respect her as a person, yet she is not able to respect my point of view, is one of the very main differences that reflects a worldview difference.",
        "The worldview on the part of those of us who are pro-choice, I think, tends to be a view that says that it is possible, in fact, to respect a whole variety of points of view along a wide spectrum of issues and you don't have to assume that everyone else is wrong even though you have a truth that works for yourself.",

        "And I'm curious to know whether or not the group discussed contraception as something that has a potential to really diffuse the whole issue.",
        "In a world that has, distinctly, problems with overpopulation and venereal disease, I'm wondering whether the groups themselves and their ability to talk to the Catholic Church, for instance, could be something that would promote a greater openness toward contraception as something to diffuse the issue."

        "Encouraging people to be responsible if they're going to be sexually active is one of the main ways to avoid the need for abortion.",
