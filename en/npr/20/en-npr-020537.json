        "Hi, thank you Neal.",
        "First I want to thank you for taking my call and secondly tell you that I think you're the best interviewer out there.",
        "Well, that's a controversial issue, but go ahead with your question.",
        "My comment is basically predicated - or comes from my experience as a leader in South Dakota opposed to the abortion ban that went to the ballot this last November.",
        "I spent a - I'm an OB/GYN.",
        "I have spent a lot of time talking to a lot of my patients and my colleagues and my family about this contentious issue, and I guess my main comment is that the terms pro-choice and pro-life have oftentimes very little meaning.",
        "And when you ask the people whether they consider themselves pro-life or pro-choice - in South Dakota anyways - most will say pro-life.",
        "But when you try to parse out their opinions based on gestational age or maternal circumstance or any other number of other issues related to abortion, the majority of people agree on a large number of things.",
        "And I think that people who fall on one side of the spectrum that believe that abortion should be illegal under all circumstances constitute a small minority.",
        "People on the other end of the spectrum who believe that a woman's right to make her own autonomous healthcare decisions and nothing else matters are also a small minority.",
        "And the vast majority of people live somewhere in the middle of that political spectrum.",
        "Would you agree with that, Nicki Nichols Gamble?",
        "Well I - I think it's true that people - that there's clearly a spectrum of points of view about abortion in this country and in any given part of the country.",
        "And I think one of the points that I was trying to make earlier, about not being willing to use the words pro-life to describe the other side is exactly, I think, what this man is suggesting.",
        "The words pro-life in my mind, you know, suggest that one is supportive of life-affirming principles.",
        "And I believe that to be true of those who are pro-choice, just as it may be true on the other side as well.",
        "Frances?",
        "Well, a couple of things.",
        "First of all, I think from the perspective of the pro-life movement, that the idea of being pro-life means being pro-life at all of its phases, including unborn human life.",
        "So that's where I would disagree with Nicki because I think that the pro-choice movement does not respect unborn human life.",
        "Second, with respect to what most people would respond in poll questions, I think it's quite important to ask what the question was.",
        "Most people in the United States find it shocking that abortion is legal for all nine months.",
        "Most people think it's only legal for the first three months, but that's not true.",
        "So I think it's important when one is looking at poll results or what the opinions are.",
        "Most people are opposed, I believe, to most abortions except perhaps for rape and incest and life of the mother, which is less than one percent of all abortions in this country.",
        "And I know that Nicki Nichols Gamble would disagree with that."

        "Good.",
        "What I was wanting to bring up was there's an interesting thing in the clinical terminology with regards to both miscarriages and abortion.",
        "And I think one thing that might be stigmatizing a lot of it is that, you know, when a woman has a miscarriage, they call it a spontaneous abortion.",
        "And they don't call it a miscarriage in the clinical world.",
        "Your show and \"\"Law & Order.\"\" Thank you.",
        "Well of course.",
        "I mean, first of all, abortion in certain circumstances can be legal late into a pregnancy, but 95 percent, if not more, of all abortions happen before the 12th week of pregnancy, and those that are occurring after that are frequently occurring because there is a condition - a maternal health condition - or there's a fetal abnormality or there's a circumstance in the woman's life that has made it a situation where she has postponed a decision.",
        "But abortion in this country is very much a phenomenon of the first trimester of pregnancy.",
        "And then the other thing I want to say is that I think it's absolutely untrue that those of us who are pro-choice don't respect unborn life.",
        "What we are looking at and thinking about is a whole variety of competing priorities that occur in the lives of women during their childbearing years.",
        "And because one has an abortion is not a reflection that you disrespect an unborn life.",
        "It's - it may be that you simply find that your priority has to be a born life, for example, other children you have, other responsibilities you have in the world.",
        "Let me flip Marvin's question around just a little bit and see if that can get back to some of what he's trying to get at in his question.",
        "And that is: tactically, Frances Hogan - tactically, wouldn't you be better off describing the other side as you were talking about it earlier, as demonizing the other side trying to make them look as extreme as possible so that your position then looks more reasonable?",
        "Well, I'm committed to the truth because I believe the truth has a beauty all its own.",
        "And what I would like to see is a civil conversation about this issue speaking, you know, the facts.",
        "When we had our dialogue for six years there were many times we couldn't even agree on the facts.",
        "It's amazing how good people can disagree.",
        "But I do think that the important thing is to have the civil concentration.",
        "In no way do I want to demonize anyone.",
        "I want the truth to come out because in my perspective, I believe that the pro-life ethic is the truth, and that if it were fully excited to society in all of its beauty that more people would become pro-life.",
        "And the same question to you, Nicki Nichols Gamble.",
        "Again, if the other side's a nutcase, then you're going to win.",
        "Well, I think perhaps there's some truth to that, but if you - but clearly I think, if you goal is to try to reduce violence and anger, you can't just broad-brush the other side by calling them all nutcases.",
        "There are probably some nutcases in both camps, and I think it would be - it's categorically wrong to simply say that the other side are not thoughtful, that they are all violent, and that they are, you know, people without conscience.",
        "That's not true and I don't think it would do my side any good if we tried to present that as the truth.",
        "Marvin, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Thank you."

        "And I wanted to say that in the past six years as you guys have been holding these meetings - and it's not unconnected to that, certainly not in Massachusetts - but it does seem to me that a lot of the venom in this argument is no longer there as strongly as it was six years ago.",
        "Would you agree Frances Hogan?",
        "Yes.",
        "You have to recall that our dialogue began in 1995 and sort of ended in '01, something like that - although we have met occasionally since then.",
        "I honestly believe that there has been a more civil conversation about this taking place at many different levels nationally as well as locally, and I think that's very helpful.",
        "Would you agree, Nicki Gamble?",
        "Yes, I would agree.",
        "I think it's hard sitting in one particular community to know what's happening everywhere else in the country.",

        "Given the delicacy with which you guys approach this - now, there was meetings in secret, there were two facilitators there - very highly skilled women who helped you all to negotiate some of the ground rules so you could have these conversations.",
        "I wonder, given all of that - of course, this group was a group of very powerful activists from both sides, too - but could you have any advice on - to normal people who want to discuss this in their lives with their family, with their friends, with coworkers?",
        "It does come up.",
        "I think that the major advice that I would have for people in general, is that they ought to seek out opportunities to talk about divisive issues that we tend to, I think, only want to talk to people with whom we agree.",
        "And when you do that, you never have a chance to really expand your own point of view on an issue.",
        "So I think that it's something that is very important to talk about, and I think we were fortunate that we had so many supports while we were doing it.",
        "But I don't think you absolutely have to have all of the support that we had, and there's certainly lots of resources that can help people learn how to have discussions across difference.",
        "And I think it's an enormously important thing to learn to do, not just because of the abortion issue but because of all kinds of other contentious issues in our society.",
        "Frances Hogan, advice?",
        "Well, what happened to me is I'm a practicing attorney in Boston.",
        "And the experience that I had after the article came out was many people said to me, Fran, I didn't know there were any sane people on the pro-life.",
        "Honestly it's the truth.",

        "For me it gave me the chance to have people not think I was completely insane - which was really the tenor of the discussion to a great extent, I believe.",

        "And on the other end, for the women who have had abortions, there would be a medical miscarriage, a medically-induced miscarriage.",
