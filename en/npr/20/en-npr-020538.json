        "It generates very heated emotion and very profound conviction on both sides.",

        "But her point was that she did not feel that the leadership of the Catholic Church in Massachusetts, in terms of the bishop, should be speaking publicly on this issue.",
        "And that angered me, and I said that on the show.",
        "And I would say that now, because I felt that one of the things we learned was to let people speak.",
        "We're not afraid of people speaking.",
        "Let them speak, let them have what they want to say and let's discuss it.",
        "But I don't think we should ever tell people that they have no right to speak.",
        "And so I would agree with Nicki, in terms of the other tools that should be brought to that discussion, but I do think that no one should be marginalized and no one should be put out of a public debate on any issue.",
        "Is it easier or harder that this is an issue that could be coming up for important votes?",
        "Well, I think whenever we have a legislative debate going on in the state that it generates its own heat and sometimes its own irrational perspective from both sides of any argument.",
        "But I remember when abortion was, you know, debated in much the same way that same-sex marriage issues is debating."
