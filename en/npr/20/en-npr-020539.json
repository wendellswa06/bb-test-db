        "I sense candidly that our faith ought to be expressed.",
        "I would probably agree with Sam Harris that if all religious expression looked like the Taliban or jihadists - I would certainly say that if you're going to make a sweeping generalization about all people of faith based on isolated incidences, you can come to an extreme conclusion, and that's in a sense what he's done.",
        "But his argument is that - and I understand - and forgive me that I can understand where this would be offensive to some, and so I would apologize for that, but if you'll allow me to give his argument for us so that we can hear your reaction to it."
