        "Glad to be with you and just listening and taking it all in.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, what do you - let me start with where we started with Pastor Johnson.",
        "What do you make of Sam Harris' argument that religion is a destructive force, and that as a consequence, because it addresses competing and irreconcilable claims to ultimate truth, that the only rational thing to do is to remove it from our public discourse.",
        "What's your thought?",
        "Religion in and of itself is not dangerous.",
        "It's the interpretation of religion that can become dangerous, and that is from Islamic as well as Christian perspective.",
        "I mean if we are a literalist in our interpretation of the Bible, then as an African-American I'd probably still be a slave and still be sitting in the back of the bus and be content and no woman would be able to say anything in the church.",
        "And in fact, if I shaved my head, I would be going against the commandments of God.",
        "I think the difference is is whether or not we are literalists in our interpretation or whether we leave room for our faith to be dynamic, whether or not we leave room for God to speak to us just as he spoke in the days of Noah and Moses and others.",
        "What I think brother Dr. Harris missed is that even atheism, in my opinion - I was a philosophy major myself - is a form of religion, and we need to be careful.",
        "My religion comes out of my faith and my belief.",
        "His religion comes out of his non-faith and his non-belief.",
        "But it is his ultimate concern, as Kierkegaard said, that which is your ultimate concern indeed is your religion.",
        "So for him to think that he is excused just because he claims to be an atheist from religious expression.",
        "And his expression wants us to not be involved; his expression, religious expression, wants us to understand that we can be extremists and cause all kind of things to happen is a form of religion in and of itself.",
        "There are competing sides in the faith community, absolutely.",
        "I am not a literalist interpreter of the word of God.",
        "I do have some problem with the radical religious right, who, on occasion, have sought to impose their faith beliefs on the rest of American society.",
        "People used the Bible to justify slavery for years and years and years, and then they go to church on Sunday morning and say praise God, from whom all blessings flow.",
        "And they would come back on Monday and whip and rape and saw no contradictions whatsoever.",
        "I think that our religion is evolving as God is speaking to us in new and dynamic ways, and we have to be open to the spirit.",
        "We don't serve a dead God.",
        "We serve a God who is involved in our history, that God who calls us to diversity and to understanding that if he wanted us all to be alike, he would have created us alike.",
        "Pastor, hold on a second.",
        "Okay?",
        "Because I want to address - you've given us a lot to work with here - but I want to go back to Sam Harris' argument.",
        "He clearly is highly critical of fundamentalists and/or conservative Christians.",
        "But he is equally critical of liberal or moderate Christians who he says are so tolerant that they don't really take religion seriously, they don't take their own beliefs seriously and that they don't really take seriously the claims, the ultimate claims of truth that are being made other religions.",
        "Do you think that people will start to pay more attention to these things or is it all just follow the money?"

        "And he believes that this kind of religious tolerance that is embraced by liberal Christians actually stops discussion of the kinds of things that Pastor Johnson was talking about, about the violence that we have seen expressed by persons (unintelligible).",
        "Well, I think that's absurd.",
        "What do you say to that?",
        "That's absurd, because we're having a discussion even now.",
        "Because one is tolerant doesn't mean that you stop discussing.",
        "I had a professor who was an atheist, and some of my best discussions and my best theological exchange was with the atheist.",
        "Because we are tolerant doesn't mean that we tolerate everything.",
        "I mean nobody in their right mind would tolerate the killing of innocent people and do it as an act of faith.",
        "I think he takes it to the extreme.",
        "What I disagree with Dr. Harris on, for him it's either black or white, it's either or, and he doesn't leave room for discussion for growth, for exchange.",
        "He wants a simplistic answer to everything, and life just is not that simple.",
        "(unintelligible)",
        "But - Pastor Johnson, you want to get back in but hold on a second.",
        "I want to go to a caller for second.",
        "Let's go to Charlotte, North Carolina, and Melissa(ph).",
        "And, Pastor Johnson, I promise to get you back in.",
        "Yeah, that's fine.",
        "Melissa?",
        "Yeah, hi.",
        "Sorry, my kids are screaming.",
        "I just was calling to say that I think people of faith have a responsibility to take part in social action, and so I would disagree with Sam Harris, and I would agree with your - the pastors that are on today.",
        "Even though I disagree with the positions that the pastor from Lancaster takes on things like gay marriage, I still think that there's a really big role, big and important role, that churches as voluntary associations take in our democracy."

        "You're taking care of the little ones and trying to talk to us, and we appreciate it.",
        "But do you - what about Sam Harris' argument that liberal Christians are providing a fig leaf, in essence, for persons whose views are less tolerant and making it harder to - really, in essence, making it harder to take seriously the intolerance of other religions, that they actually provide cover for folks whose views are more divisive than theirs and make it harder to call them to account?",
        "What would you say to that?",
        "I guess I would agree with your - the second pastor that was talking about just that - I don't know.",

        "I think that for our liberal friends to assume that the only ones with compassion are those who are on the left side of the ledger, I think that's overstating it.",
        "I think we can learn from each other, we can grow from each other.",
        "But it is myopic, it is nearsighted historically to say that people of faith should not have a place of the public table.",
        "Reverend MacDonald, can I ask you to grapple with the question, since I take it you disagree with Pastor Johnson on some of these policy issues that concern us today, like stem cell research and perhaps abortion.",
        "And so, the question then becomes - I asked Pastor Johnson this earlier - when you have points of view that cannot be reconciled, the argument that Sam Harris makes is that religion then becomes coercive, that it becomes a vehicle by which some impose their beliefs on others who do not share them.",
        "And how do you as man of faith address that?",
        "Well, I don't that public policy religion should be in the bedroom, period.",
        "And I think that any time when we seek to impose legislation that becomes public policy for the whole nation as diverse as America is, then we're treading on dangerous grounds.",
        "Certainly I think that Pastor Johnson and myself probably are much closer on issues of abortion and some other issues, but I don't think we should be legislating that.",
        "I don't think that we should be passing constitutional amendments.",
        "I don't think that the government should be getting in the business of people's personal individual choices and freedoms.",

        "George Bush and Nancy Regan are divided on that issue.",
        "Members of the religious right are even divided on the issue.",
        "And so that when we find theses kinds of division, don't think that it's all or nothing, and that's where I disagree with Dr. Harris.",
        "That he wants to throw the baby out with the bath because religious folk can't get their act together.",
        "And the first thing I thought of was yes, that's true, that is in the Bible, which I believe to be the word of God, but it was also in the Old Testament before the coming of Jesus Christ who, you know, taught us things like do onto others and turn the other cheek.",
        "Religious folk can't ever have their act together.",
        "We've never been homogenous, except that we, you know, say we believe in God.",
        "Once you get beyond that -even talking about Jesus - you're going to find a great deal of division.",
        "So keep our faith in the faith quarters and not in legislation.",
        "And now we're trying to pass legislation that pastors can endorse from the pulpits and can raise money and give to candidates.",
        "That violates separation of church and state."

        "And that's where you see some of that that does cross over the line occasionally.",
        "Yeah, I think we have far more in common than we have that is dissimilar, but again it's a matter of interpretation.",
        "Even when you talk about Abraham Lincoln, because you will find a number of African American pastors and parishioners who believe that Lincoln did not free slaves.",
