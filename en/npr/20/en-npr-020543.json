        "Whether you're talking about what has been in the news a lot lately about the levees and the public works that needed to be strengthened there, to the terrible tragedy of the evacuation, there is, in fact, no reason why so many hundreds of thousands of people needed to be trapped in New Orleans.",
        "And why was it avoidable?",
        "Well, in terms of the mitigation issues, the initial prevention issues, the problem of the vulnerability of the levees had been well outlined and well identified, and it was common knowledge--and I'm saying common knowledge in the emergency management, civil engineering and social science communities--that those levees could withstand, at best, a fast-moving Category 3 hurricane.",
        "There had been a lot of attempts to try to get some more investment made there.",
        "They failed.",
        "With respect to the evacuation, similarly, it was well-understood beforehand that there were many hundreds of thousands of people actually in the impact area who lacked their own transportation and would not be able to get out if an evacuation order was given.",
        "There were delays.",
        "There was delays in terms of issuing mandatory orders, and there was a complete failure to try to think about how to get the most vulnerable people out of harm's way.",
        "It didn't have to be like this, Ira.",
        "We had 9/11 and then we had a commission that examined what went wrong with 9/11, and we've had everybody in the government saying how we should be better now, be better prepared after 9/11 for dealing with emergencies.",
        "Why were we so ill-prepared?",
        "What did we not learn from 9/11 or what changed after 9/11 that perhaps made things worse?",
        "Well, the dilemma we've seen over the last five years with this huge infusion of money to support preparedness for terrorism is that local emergency managers, state officials have followed the money.",
        "And we have not been able to pay the attention needed to natural hazards.",
        "OK.",
        "Kensha, let me turn to you.",
        "What issue is most important to you right now?",
        "Well, there are a lot of people in the research community and in the emergency management community who believe that post-9/11 trends and actions that were taken have actually left us more vulnerable, both to natural disasters and to terrorist attacks.",
        "Two of the biggest problems have to do with what happened when FEMA merged with the vastly larger bureaucracy.",
        "The second problem has to do with the overwhelming focus that had been placed in this country on prevention, deterrence and preparedness for terrorist attacks, virtually at the exclusion of every other type of extreme event that could strike our country.",
        "I am not, by any means, saying that we shouldn't prepare for terrorist attacks.",
        "That is absolutely necessary.",
        "But to act as if the laws of nature were repealed on 9/11 and that we would not be seeing bigger and stronger hurricanes, that we still didn't have a potential for a catastrophic earthquake in California was lacking in foresight, to say the least.",
        "That would be a gross understatement."
