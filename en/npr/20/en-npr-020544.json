        "Henry Petroski, before I move on, let me ask you if you heard the president--and I'm sure you've read the text of--or at least the news reports of his speech last night?",
        "He vowed to rebuild the Gulf Coast and New Orleans.",
        "Is it possible--as an engineer, as yourself, as someone who has studied the situation, is it possible to recover from Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and rebuild it?",
        "Oh, sure, without question, it can be recovered from and rebuilt.",
        "But at what cost will be the key question.",
        "And whether $200 billion will be that cost, I think, remains to be seen.",
        "Engineers are prepared to rebuild to recover, but they can only do so much with so much money.",
        "There are going to be pressures to divide the money up.",
        "It's not only New Orleans that was, you know, impacted, of course.",
        "There will be pressures to spread the money around.",
        "And then as we just heard, there are still, you know, other disasters lurking that we have to be prepared for.",
        "Are we going to take further money away from preparation for natural disasters elsewhere?",
        "It's a very, very difficult predicament to be in, coming as it has in the wake of 9/11.",
        "I think there are going to be some very tough decisions that are going to have to be made over the coming years.",
        "Everything involves risk, and the question is going to be what level of risk are we willing to accept?",
        "Is it possible to raise--you've written about this in The New York Times, an OP-ED story, saying that it is actually possible to raise the level of New Orleans, the new New Orleans, above actually Lake Pontchartrain.",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "There are historical precedents for this.",
        "The city of Galveston was raised as much as 16 feet after the hurricane of the year 1900, which killed at least 6,000 people.",
        "The city of Chicago was raised in the 19th century when they wanted to install a new sewer system.",
        "So it can be done, but obviously, the impact on the character of the city, the impact on the people is enormous.",
        "And the question is will there be a will?",
        "But what does New Orleans want or what will New Orleans tolerate?",
        "Do you have to bulldoze the buildings out of the way to build up the land?",
        "Well, yes, that's one way of doing it, but you could also raise the buildings and then fill in under them.",
        "That's the way it was done in Galveston.",
        "Or conversely, in Chicago, first they raised the streets and then the buildings were jacked up to meet the new street level.",
        "Lucile Jones, one of the most anticipated disasters in California is the big one.",
        "Are people prepared for that?",
        "We are much more prepared than we were 25 years ago, but we're not nearly where I'd like us to be.",
        "There's a lot more that we could be doing, and it gets back to the same ideas that have just been raised.",
        "It depends upon how much will we have to address the problem before the earthquake vs. what we are going to end up paying afterwards.",
        "Do you feel that it's the job of the state to do that or it should be looking for federal money?",
        "I think it's a job that's probably--the state needs to be a big partner in it, but it's probably not one that can be done alone at that level, because the type of things that we're talking about, you know, what does prepared mean?",
        "There's the ability to respond afterwards, and that's always--the first responders are always going to be the locals turning to the federal government for support when they become overwhelmed.",
        "There's also the issue of what we do beforehand, like, you know, strengthening the levees in New Orleans.",
        "It could have been done beforehand and had less problems now."

        "There are other mitigative activities that we could be taking in California.",
        "We could be doing more to retrofit our older buildings.",
        "We could be looking at the fact that all of our pipelines and lifelines across the San Andreas are going to be offset during that event.",
        "That's something where there's an engineering solution to fix it, but we haven't yet decided it's worth spending the money on.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We'll talk more about these issues and bring in our other guests after we take this break, talking about waiting for the next big disaster.",
        "What can we do in advance in anticipation of it?",

        "And let me ask you, Rich Eisner, what keeps you awake at night?",
        "Ah.",
        "What would be the most--biggest, crying out need now in California for a natural hazard?",
        "Would it be the earthquake?",
        "I think the earthquake both in Northern California and Southern California because it has very broad impacts on about 30 million people."

        "Lucy Jones was talking about preparing for these pipelines and things that cross over the San Andreas fault line.",
        "Do you agree with that, that's a high priority?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And it's not just the southern San Andreas.",
        "It's the Hayward fault in Northern California, and all the water coming into the Bay area comes across the Hayward fault, as do fuel pipelines, power lines, major transportation routes, so we could have a situation in either Northern or Southern California where we're basically cut off from the rest of the continent.",
        "Did we learn any lessons for--Kathleen Tierney, from 9/11 about--it seems like you're saying we--the--we have really learned nothing about to deal with giant events that spin out of control and recovering from them.",
        "Well, I'm sorry to say that, unfortunately, that's the case.",
        "And while we're talking about 9/11, you know, the 9-11 Commission put out, as you know, a very large, very lengthy report, and there was a chapter in the 9-11 Commission report that talked about the emergency response, and this was one poorly written chapter.",
        "I mean, it really lacked a complete understanding of what preparedness and response actually are, and its recommendations were, to say the least, unhelpful.",
        "We know...",
        "Can you give me an example of what that--what you mean by that?",
        "Well, most of the space in the chapter was devoted to talking about individual first response agencies and counting up the number of resources that they had.",
        "Another big focus was on communications equipment and communications issues.",
        "The management of large-scale disasters involves much, much more than communications equipment and, you know, how many fire trucks you have.",
        "It involves developing an integrated, strategic vision that cuts across organizations in the public and private sector for how we are going to mange these large-scale events.",
        "Preparedness includes things like public education and public awareness, the development of strong interorganizational networks, the development of memoranda of understanding, mutual aid agreements, the training of ordinary citizens who are the true first responders in any disaster situation.",
        "It involves commitment from high-level government officials at the federal, state and local level that put disasters and emergency management on the public agenda.",
        "All of these kinds of things.",
        "Most of what was dealt with in the 9/11 report had to do with tactical and operational issues, not with policy and strategic issues.",
        "It is at the policy level and at the level of large-scale strategy where the thinking and the change needs to take place.",
        "Do you prepare differently for a terrorist attack than you would for a natural disaster attack or is it the same preparation?",

        "The general principle of emergency that has been adopted in this country is a principle called all-hazards planning, that you don't plan for an individual event.",
        "You set up a framework where you are able, first of all, to analyze your vulnerabilities and then plan to address those vulnerabilities.",
        "A second principle is known as the principle of comprehensive emergency management.",
        "That is that there is attention paid to mitigating future disasters, preparing for them, responding to them and recovering from them, and that these four phases--mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery--should be well integrated.",
        "And the actors involved in these different phases should be talking to one another and all working from the same rulebook, if you will.",
        "It is not a principle of emergency management that one plans for a single disaster or type of disasters.",
        "To do so goes back on 20 years of advances that have been made in emergency management, and I'd like to ask Rich if he'd like to pick up on this.",

        "It's dealing with transportation and communications recovery.",
        "It's a functional response, regardless of the event.",
        "And I think we have focused over the last five years on one type of event, and we have not really addressed the needs of strengthening our infrastructure to withstand natural hazards."

        "Henry Petroski, how do you get the politicians, the decision-makers, the people who fork over the money, the people who make the long plans for natural disasters--how do you convince them that one is imminent, even though it's not imminent?",

        "On 170 acres, there are chickens and rows and rows of soybeans, the region's cash crop, says Zotar.",

        "I think a lot of the discussion that we're having here and that has taken place in the wake of 9/11 has recognized that natural hazards were neglected compared to terrorism.",
        "That's a natural response to a failure of the kind that 9/11 was.",
        "It's like the squeaky wheel gets the attention.",
        "Whatever has been the most recent disaster becomes the next disaster in the minds of many people, especially politicians, because they react that way.",
        "I think if we, you know, take a step backward and look at the bigger picture, we recognize that this kind of dynamic is happening, and we should not now, for example, let New Orleans or the Gulf Coast make it seem that the only natural disaster to worry about is a hurricane.",
        "Certainly, that's important, but there are other disasters.",
        "I would also say that not all disasters give equal warning.",
        "In the case of a hurricane, there is some warning.",
        "There are weather forecasts.",
        "We watch these things coming across the ocean and up the Gulf.",

        "Is that a natural disaster or is that a structural failure?",
