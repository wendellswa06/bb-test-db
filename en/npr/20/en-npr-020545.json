        "Hi.",
        "First up, I want to thank you very much for having this show, and I have to say your guests have made some very insightful points.",
        "As far as the difference between the natural disasters and the terrorist attacks, I worked in New York City during the 9/11 recovery, and terrorist attacks are targeted.",
        "Things like natural disasters, they pretty much hit everybody.",
        "So you don't have the ability that--the targeted areas are going to be generally more affluent, a smaller section of a community, etc. Something like Hurricane Katrina is huge.",
        "And since 9/11, I've been involved in some emergency management planning as a horse owner, because they're not dogs and cats that you can just sort of take with you in your own family car.",
        "That's a bigger issue.",
        "And in doing that, I've discovered--and in watching a lot of the Hurricane Katrina stuff, you've seen that the disaster management plans, what few there are around, have no provision at all for people taking pets with them.",
        "And as we've seen in a lot of the Katrina stories, people didn't want to leave their pets behind, and that was a decision for a lot of people to stay in their homes, and they shouldn't have.",
        "If there was an opportunity to at least get them out of there with them, even if they had to put them in another shelter, they would have been more willing to go.",
        "If there was some kind of communication to people that they could have done this, it would have saved a lot of lives, because people would have left, and secondly, it would have cut down on a lot of their problems they're having now because of animals, as well as people, who are dead and who are polluting the water that's there.",
        "Let me get a response...",
        "Actually, it's a a huge problem.",
        "Rich Eisner, any comment?",
        "Well, I think that all disaster victims are not equal, and in fact victimness is frequently defined by the amount of resources you have, whether you can invest before the disaster in mitigation to prepare yourself, whether you have the resources to go to a hotel rather than going to a shelter.",
        "So I think we need to recognize that in our planning.",
        "And it appears that certainly this last event, they didn't really accommodate or account for the fact that people could not self-evacuate if they didn't have money.",
        "I think the issue of animals, I think, is right on point.",
        "We have seen with the fires and floods here in California that we have to set up parallel shelters for domestic animals, for people's pets.",
        "All right, Lauren.",
        "Thanks for calling.",
        "Thank you."

        "I'm Ira Flatow.",
        "Let me ask you, Rich, tell us about California's disaster plan.",
        "Let's go through a scenario.",
        "What would happen, say, in the event that a major earthquake occurs in the Bay area or Southern California?",
        "Do things automatically kick in?",
        "I think...",
        "Besides the ground, I mean.",
        "The ground kicks and, in fact, because of the number of disasters we've had going back into earthquakes at the turn of the century in 1906, we have a pretty robust emergency management system, probably paralleled by Florida because of the number of hurricanes.",
        "We've had a master mutual aid agreement which gives the governor the authority to move resources anywhere in the state from local government to local government.",
        "We've had that since Earl Warren was governor in the mid-'50s.",
        "Because of the earthquakes and fires, we've developed what's called the Incident Command System, which is an organization structure that about 10 years ago was adopted by FEMA, and that's now been expanded into a standard of care for emergency management nationwide.",
        "So as was stated I think earlier by Kathleen, you need to have a strategic organization and a strategic view.",
        "Interviews, in my mind, should be investigative.",
        "You shouldn't know what you're going to hear going into them.",
        "You should be surprised.",
        "And I was surprised.",
        "But I was surprised by how little I found out, not by how much I found out.",
        "What would happen in a major earthquake is, first of all, with the assistance of folks like Lucy Jones and the USGS, we would have a map within one or two minutes of what the ground motions look like.",
        "We would know where the damage was most likely and we'd be able to immediately start ramping up, moving resources into the affected area.",
        "And the mutual aid systems would kick in to get resources shared locally, and then if locals didn't have the resources they need, they could ask the state for assistance, and then we would draw on FEMA.",
        "Lucy, do you think--is the state prepared, well-prepared for a major shake?",
        "We're in a lot better shape than we could be, without question.",
        "I think that one of the points that Rich makes here is that the ability of the scientists to, if not predict the time, at least predict the consequences of an earthquake...",
        "Yeah."

        "He talked about the shake map where we would be delivering information about the ground shaking.",
        "That's part modeling.",
        "We see in New Orleans that the scientists had modeled what was going to happen; they told you what it was going to be.",
        "What we need to do, though, is make sure that we communicate between the scientists and turn those models into action to mitigate.",
        "Henry Petroski, LA a few days ago got a little bit of a scare with a little bit of a brownout or a blackout in certain parts of the city there and got people to wondering, gee, this reminds us of two years ago when there was a major blackout in the country.",
        "Yet what has happened in those two years to repair the grid?",
        "Well, I don't know, Ira...",
        "Yeah.",
        "I'm not asking you tell us what has happened, but I'm philosophically saying we don't hear at all about--you know, it's almost like when the problem is gone, we're going back to our complacency again.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "Complacency is really the enemy of all of what we're talking about.",
        "And it just seems to be inevitable that we do fall back into it, not necessarily those who are professionally involved.",
        "They recognize, you know, what the consequences are.",
        "But funding, political backing and public support are not likely to be as conscientious.",
        "The fact of the matter is that whenever something goes wrong, that we look at it, but as it recedes into the distance we begin to forget about it.",
        "It is inevitable that it's going to happen that way.",

        "Sure.",
        "On the issue of, you know, natural vs. man-made disasters, disaster researchers really think of a disaster as the coming together of three elements.",
        "One is the physical force itself, like a 6.7 earthquake or a Category 5 hurricane.",
        "The second is..."

        "Kathleen, you have the floor again as when I rudely interrupted you.",
        "Just first of all making the point that when we think about disasters, we have to think about them as involving the intersection or the confluence of three different large factors.",
        "One is the physical event itself.",
        "The second factor has to do with the vulnerability of the built environment, such as those unreinforced masonry buildings in California that Lucy was just talking about or the vulnerable levees in New Orleans.",
        "But the third element, equally important, is the vulnerability of populations themselves.",
        "And this is what Rich was talking about when he said that disasters do not hit people indiscriminately, that there is a stratification, if you will, of vulnerability and of the capacity to respond to and recover from disasters.",
        "So we have to think about those three dimensions.",
        "Second, I wanted to point out that communities all around the country have access to decision support systems to help them envision what might happen in disasters and plan for those contingencies.",
        "I'm thinking here in particular of HAZUS, H-A-Z-U-S.",
        "which was developed by FEMA to be a loss estimation tool for earthquakes, for floods and for wind.",
        "And HAZUS is widely used around the country by cities in their planning."

        "How much of an early warning system--and what do we do about them if we find them?",
        "And what were you going-in assumptions of Rumsfeld?",
        "Third, and then I'll shut up, I want to mention that, you know, in talking about what needs to be done, there are a number of research agendas and research recommendations out there.",
        "For example, in June of this year, June of 2005, the subcommittee on disaster reduction, which is part of the National Science and Technology Council, which in turn is part of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, put out a report called Grand Challenges for Disaster Reduction.",
        "And it included a discussion of six grand challenges and what kind of research and action are needed to address those grand challenges.",
        "The Earthquake Engineering Research Institute in Oakland, California, has similarly put out a strategic research and action document for how we deal with the earthquake problem in this country.",
        "So there are a lot of research agendas out there.",
        "There are a lot of recommendations out there.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Where's the political will to do something about it?",
        "Well, now you hit the nail on the head of what we're talking about this hour, is where do you get the political will to listen to the people who are saying there are these problems and to actually implement, you know, instead of being treated as, you know, Chicken Little, the sky is falling, that something really unusual and bad might happen.",

        "Hi.",
        "I just wanted to say thanks.",

        "I'm not--I wasn't really all that aware of what was going on at the time a few days before the hurricane because I don't have a TV.",
        "And I was wondering if there actually was effort made to distribute water to, you know, like, for instance, to evacuate before, pre-hurricane.",
        "Was there any effort to help people to evacuate?",
        "I came to New Orleans and I've been--I just spent six years living in the New York City area.",
        "I was there when 9/11 happened.",
        "You know, it seemed to me that things flowed a lot easier because the people in Manhattan have a lot more money than the people that live in New Orleans as a whole group.",
        "And if you don't know anyone who knows anyone who knows anyone who has a car--you know, I heard the lady in Massachusetts, to put your pet in the family car--if you don't know anyone who knows anyone who knows anyone who has a family car, you're not going to get in the family car, you're not going to put your pet in the family car.",
        "You know, if you don't even have bus fare, for instance, how are you going to get out of the city?"
