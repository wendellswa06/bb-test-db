        "Do you know?",
        "Well, I think, you know, it's a good point, and our model is that preparedness and response is not just government, it's every individual.",
        "It's how you prepare yourself if you have the resources to do it; how local government is able to then communicate what the threats are and how you should individually prepare and have a stake and support local governments.",
        "And, you know, from the first look at the at least media reports in New Orleans is there were failures at virtually every level.",

        "Actually, I was--you know, in your conversations about earthquakes, a lot of people focused on California, and I thought maybe I could draw your guests' attention towards the damage, the more widespread damage that might be caused by an earthquake from the New Madrid fault, which would be amplified by the soft sediments and the buildings that aren't prepared for this sort of an earthquake.",

        "A New Madrid event, for a number of reasons.",

        "In some states they don't have building codes or they don't use a seismic building code.",
        "They have a wealth of schools and armories and hospitals that are made of of unreinforced masonry.",
        "And all you can do is imagine the scenario in which the earthquake occurs in the middle of winter and there are no structures and no shelters available.",
        "It would be truly catastrophic.",
        "And that holds the record, that area, for the worst hurricane in the Lower 48, right?",
        "Well, the largest sequence of earthquakes was in 1811, 1812...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...and there were an estimated three magnitude 8 events.",
        "Actually, the estimates are going down for the magnitude, but one of the reasons that they looked so bad is because indeed the ground out there transmits the energy over a greater distance.",
        "So the same size earthquake affects a larger area.",
        "And I think that point about building codes that Rich made is incredibly important.",
        "There are huge investments that have been made in California, and we're still worried, and yet what about the states where those investments haven't happened?",
        "And we often talk--in black humor, we'll say that God hates trailer parks, but the fact is that the cheaper construction that's with the poorer populations is often the ones that are most susceptible to the earthquake damage.",
        "So it's another place where class affects the outcome.",

        "Well, you have to do is look at the face of the moon to see what the probability of us getting hit by an asteroid is or look at, you know, the buried craters we don't see on this planet 'cause they're under the ocean and things.",

        "Who is going to decide how to rebuild the city and in what form?",
        "We mentioned just briefly earlier about the possibility of raising the city.",
        "Might it be wise, for example, to raise it in strategic places so that they would be refuges for people, for example, who don't have the means to escape an oncoming flood or a hurricane, to escape to high ground?",
        "Might it be wise to put the emergency facilities on high ground rather than, as we saw, the Superdome, which began to flood?",
        "These kinds of planning decisions are just enormous, and they have so many dimensions that it's hard to know what is going to happen.",
        "I suspect that there's going to be somewhat of a repeat of what's happening in New York City and namely that there were so many constituencies that there's virtual gridlock about going forward.",

        "I also wonder, is it possible, Henry--and I'll ask all of you as we're getting close to the end--in the polarizing political climate that we have today, for long-term contracts and projects to be carried out from one administration to another?",
        "You're talking about how many years?",
        "Possibly a decade or more of rebuilding a city and the whole coastal area there.",
        "And I'm reminded when President Carter implemented plans to send the country down the road toward energy conservation and alternative fuels, something that would take many years to complete, one of the first things that President Reagan did when he took office was to eliminate those programs.",
