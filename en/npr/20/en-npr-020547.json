        "Well, that's an excellent, excellent question.",
        "I would suggest the way that we might begin to think about it is to establish some kind of autonomous entity that would have continuity beyond a single administration, something like a Tennessee Valley Authority, let's say, or something that's bigger than whatever the local and temporal politics are.",

        "And I think...",
        "And I think also that there tends to be a flavor-of-the-day kind of approach, that the efforts in the last administration--it was called Project Impact--to promote mitigation, promote pre-disaster investment, because it was associated with the Clinton administration, was abandoned by the current administration.",
        "It really undercuts the whole effort in disaster preparedness.",
        "I would like to add to that and to say that the problem of disasters in this society cannot be addressed in a partisan fashion.",
        "There are no Republican disasters and there are no Democratic disasters.",
        "There are only disasters.",
        "But before we do anything at all, we need in this country an independent, objective, investigative commission consisting of experts who will help us understand what went wrong in Katrina and what went right.",
        "We need people like Professor Petroski and Dr. Jones and Richard Eisner and other experts to staff a committee to give the American public a credible answer to the questions that they have been posing.",
        "Well, I think that's a good place to stop because we've run out of time.",
        "We'll see what happens.",
        "We'll see, you know--we noticed how much was implemented from the 9-11 Commission.",

        "It was a spoonerism.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, and you know spoonerism is where you interchange the initial consonant sounds of the words in one phrase to get a new phrase.",
        "Like wild cherry becomes child wary.",
        "And I said name a popular tourist spot in Europe, four letters in the first word, six letters in the last, spoonerize the name and you'll get a new phrase meaning got drunk.",
