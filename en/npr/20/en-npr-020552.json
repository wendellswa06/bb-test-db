        "Sometimes quietly, sometimes with anger and even violence, cities around the country have been grappling with that truth, a truth embedded in the question of what to do with symbols that are still defended by some as reverence for courageous ancestors but are now understood by many others as political statements about white supremacy that no longer have a place in the public square.",
        "Mayor Landrieu's front-row seat in that debate is the subject of his new book, \"\"In The Shadow Of Statues: A White Southerner Confronts History.\"\" And Mayor Mitch Landrieu joins us now from New York.",

        "Those are actually the words of the individuals that put the monuments up to basically send a signal to the rest of the country that the Confederacy may have lost the war, but the cause was an honorable and noble cause.",
        "And I, as a white Southerner, wanted to say this clearly that I recognize that the Civil War intended to destroy the United States of America, not to unite it.",
        "And it was specifically fought to preserve the institution of slavery.",
        "And for some reason, people are having a hard time - some people - just acknowledging that that is true, as though somehow that condemns their ancestors that fought in the war.",

        "And that a white woman came to the high school that I was at and confronted me and, you know, basically said that my father was an n-lover, and that the reason why I was the way it was was because I was really black and that my father ruined the city because he let black people in it.",
        "Well, when a woman - an older woman - is yelling at a 13-year-old, it's very confusing.",
        "And so I tell those stories to just kind of make the point that this really isn't about public policy - although it is in some ways - that it's about the way we personally experience each other and how confused people can be about this very issue.",
