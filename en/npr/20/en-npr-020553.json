        "And it sounded like he was going through a bit of a paralyzing sort of crisis.",
        "But she had already done so much, and it was creating so much of a strain that she needed to sort of step way back, let him know that she trusted him to take whatever steps he needed to take, and that, you know, she was available to help and assist him in any way, including not pay attention to his job search and just have sort of a relationship that's free of that for a little while.",
