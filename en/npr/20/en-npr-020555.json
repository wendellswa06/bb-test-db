        "We don't hear that, and you only have to get people to tell you their recollections of President Carter's energy policies to get you to understand why a lot of Americans don't like hearing, you know, conserve, turn the lights off, don't do this, don't do that.",

        "Each one you put in your house could save you 15 bucks a year on your electricity bill.",
        "Savings means saving money, savings means saving energy, and as you go throughout your home and find places to put these bulbs in, you could really make a huge difference in your bill and it's like preventing the need for a lot of new coal-fired power plants out there.",
        "It can really make a difference for our country.",

        "We're already past the fluorescent age, then we have new LEDs coming out.",

        "We are seeing, now, a race to build a better light bulb.",
        "We used the same old type of light bulbs for 80 years and now all of a sudden it's like, hey, we can actually do a lot better.",
        "And we're seeing that with all sorts of different kinds of devices, appliances, and of course, to get back to what you're saying before, cars.",
        "We - there's no reason why, in this country, we shouldn't all be getting an average of 40 miles per gallon.",
        "We can probably do a lot better than that.",
        "But if we all got 40 miles per gallon, we could save 20 billion barrels of oil.",
        "And that just happens to be the same amount of oil that's probably in these areas that are under moratorium for offshore drilling.",

        "But right now, the states set the speed limits.",
        "We always have an option of lowering the speed limits to save energy, but we're trying to deliver to consumers technologies like hybrid vehicles, like plug-in hybrid vehicles, that can run on the electricity or biofuels, so that folks can have the performances they want in a vehicle, but still save energy and reduce emissions.",
        "But that may take months or years to realize you could do - overnight to lower speed limits and have an effect the next day.",
        "That's right, and we are hearing great stories from some of our NRDC members who say that by going the speed limit, by not peeling out from stop signs, and other really common-sense driving methods, they're able to save - sometimes they can get 20 percent better mileage by just making relatively small changes to driving style.",
