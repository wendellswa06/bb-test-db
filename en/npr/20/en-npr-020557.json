        "Those are the LEDs?",

        "And how much will we expect to pay for that?",
        "An LED is going to be more expensive at first cost.",
        "But over the life which it can be as much as 10 years, before you have to replace that light, it's going to be a very life-cycle effective investment.",
        "And of course, you won't have the mercury disposal problem that we have in the compact and the regular fluorescents.",
        "I sometimes think that that disposal problem is a little bit overblown.",
        "It's very - there's less mercury in a compact fluorescent than a 100 - I'm sorry.",

        "My suggestion is that so many cities around the country are trying to put in cameras at intersections, to catch people from running a red light.",
        "And if those cameras were hooked into the traffic control system, they would be able to regulate the traffic better, so someone didn't have to pull up to an empty intersection stop, because the light would be turned green in their favor.",
        "Great suggestion, you know.",
        "In the age of the Internet, could we not monitor real-time traffic flow and change the traffic patterns to match that time of the traffic flow?",

        "Real-time pricing is going to be - you (unintelligible) with us across the country in the next two decades, but it's going to take investments by our utilities, and proper rules and regulations by the utility commissions, and it's going to take education to help consumers.",
        "We do a lot of consumer choice right now for your coffee or your cell phone.",
