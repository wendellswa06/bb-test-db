        "So, I think it's going to good use.",
        "It's not being wasted.",
        "Thanks for calling.",

        "We are going to see truckers lining up now going - after they are done with buying their burgers, they are going to be emptying their tanks into their tanks.",
        "Well, that young man's also in Virginia where one might argue there is a little more fried food going on.",
        "So, he is probably at an advantage there.",

        "Veggie oil?",
        "Yeah, I think so.",
        "In that case, you still are kind of interested in how many gallons you are using to cover given distance, and then in the caller's case, he is talking about using 100 gallons of fuel over the course of 10,000 miles.",
        "It is still helps with the math and figuring out how efficient you're being.",
        "There's a lot of other interesting wrinkles with getting a chance to use recycled materials in terms of no net introduction of carbon.",
        "So, there's other benefits.",
        "But yeah, it is the same logic as with gas.",
        "However, another important benefit of biodiesel and biofuel is that they do not have sulfur, sulfur, which is bad for the catalytic converters and the emissions control devices.",
        "So, biodiesel is an excellent fuel that we would like to increase the use of here in United Sates."

        "Julia, tell us about the Simple Steps program that the NRDC has.",
        "Sure, well, Simple Steps is a website, simplesteps.org, where folks can go with pretty much any kind of question that might come up on, you know, how do I do something the green way or way that saves energy that is better for the environment?",
        "And one other thing I like about it is that we have divided it up into, if you got a minute, here is the thing you can do, if you got a morning, here are the things you can do, and if you got a month.",
        "So, for instance, we are talking about saving on your cooling cost.",
        "You know, if you got a minute, run around your house and close the shades before you go out.",
        "If you got a morning, well, then you can change the filter on your air conditioner and you could really make it a lot more efficient.",
        "And if you got a whole morning, then you got all sorts of things you can read up on in terms lowering your cost.",
        "So, it is a really great way for people to go and find these simple answers because they are so much information about there.",

        "Yes.",
        "It depends on how well-insulated your house is, and it is probably something you can tell yourself.",
        "If you leave it off while you are at work, and assuming you close all your shades, if you come home and you can still feel a little bit of coolness, then you probably made the right call.",
        "There are some houses though that, you know, they just don't hold the cooling and so your house will become so hot, you have to use lot of energy to cool it down again.",
        "So, once we get all the houses insulated really well, they will probably hold the cooling, but we have a lot of investing in insulation in this country before everyone is at that point.",
        "It is hard to believe that there is not that much insulation out there, you know?",
        "MR.",
        "RODGERS: Well, Ira, one of the areas we're working on most strongly at the department is to improve building codes across the country and increase the amount of insulation that is required.",
        "But building codes are set at the state and local level, so all the department can do is create a model building code and then promote it.",
        "But we do need to work very hard on that, and as Julia said, to improve the efficiency of the built environment.",
        "But I would recommend the programmable thermostat, so that you can have a setback.",
        "Also that the house can - doesn't have to spend the air conditioner on while you are at work.",
        "And that would be another thing to do, is to buy the most efficient air conditioner that you can find."

        "The EER rating that would be good?",
        "The SEER 13 is the minimum that you can buy anywhere in the country, but we have SEER 14 and higher that are available with the EnergyStar label.",
        "I didn't think they went that high.",
        "Oh, yes, we are working on technologies.",
        "They can get you to a SEER 19 or 20.",
        "And then, those technologies though will be probably focused on different climate zones around the country where we can do something one way in the southwest versus the southeast.",
