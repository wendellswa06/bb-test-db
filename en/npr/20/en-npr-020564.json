        "The Pentagon is investigating, and Congress has held hearings.",
        "Meanwhile, women in the Marines say this is not an isolated incident, and the broader culture of the Marines is in need of change.",
        "This week, about a hundred of these Marine women signed an open letter to the service that said this.",
        "(Reading) We have allowed to thrive and, in some instances, even encouraged a culture where women are devalued, demeaned and their contributions diminished.",
        "We understand why.",
        "In a culture that prizes masculinity, it is easy to mistake barbarism for strength, brutality for power, savagery for ferocity.",
        "That's Major Janine Garner, one of the Marines who signed the letter.",

        "Welcome.",
        "Hi.",
        "Why did you decide to address this issue in such a large scale, public way?",
        "One of my experience in the Marine Corps, particularly given that I'm in aviation, has been one where women are frequently isolated and often wonder and think that these things that we experience happen only to us.",
        "Well, when my friends and I - my peers and I got together and we started talking - because obviously everybody was very upset with the - everything that happened with Marines United - and again, that was just the catalyst.",
        "Marines United was the name of the photo-sharing page where all of this unfolded - yeah.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So it was kind of a catalyst.",
        "And as we got together and we spoke, we realized that we couldn't stay quiet anymore and that by coming together, we had a much stronger voice than just kind of individually screaming, you know, in our little stovepipes I guess, for lack of a better term, that this was not OK.",
        "Can you tell us about the personal experience you had that convinced you that things needed to change?"

        "For me, it really came to a head back in I want to say around May of 2016 where a Facebook group similar to Marines United took a picture from my personal Instagram page that was a photo of me and seven other female marine field grade officers as we were at lunch in our uniforms and took this picture, posted it to the page.",
        "And I watched in real time as hundreds of people commented on this photo and said things like, you know - they wanted to rape us.",
        "They immediately reduced us to our sexuality, as to whether we were doable, not doable, every amount of vitriol.",
        "We were called the worst names.",
        "And I mean these were leaders in the Marine Corps.",
        "I guess for myself, I was less upset because I've dealt with stuff like this before, but these seven other women who I highly respect and admire who have deployed multiple times, gone to combat, are Marines just like everybody else were being demeaned in this way.",
        "And the conversation, because of the Marines United, was all about the nude photos.",
        "The dialogue kept being the nude photos, the nude photos, the nude photos.",
        "Oh, well they shouldn't have taken those pictures of themselves.",
        "The problem isn't the photos.",
        "The problem is the treatment of one Marine to another, and that is completely unacceptable and goes against our core ethos and values.",
        "On the policy level, what do you think needs to change in the Marine Corps?",
        "Well, in terms of policies, the first change I'd really like to see is an increase of numbers of women in the Marine Corps.",
        "I believe we need to improve our recruitment and our retention of female Marines specifically.",
        "I'd like to see our numbers get up to at least 20 percent.",
        "Now it's around 7 percent.",
        "Is that right?",
        "It's currently around 7 percent.",
        "And in aviation, we make up less than 4 percent.",
        "For example, I'm at the largest Marine Corps air base, and I am the only female pilot on this base.",
        "And that's incredibly isolating, and that means wherever I go, I'm the unicorn.",
        "I'm, oh, the female pilot, if that makes sense.",
        "So it's still an oddity.",
        "It's still commented on.",

        "And still many months to go, but the latest Washington Post/ABC poll out today shows Senator Obama with an eight point-lead over Senator McCain, but also a level of concern, interestingly, about both candidates, well, Obama's experience, and other questions about Senator McCain, too.",

        "Well, there's no question about that.",
        "But remember, the thing we must remember, this is not a national election.",

        "So, it's state-by-state warfare that's going on right now, especially in key states, like Michigan, like Ohio, like Florida.",
        "And maybe like Georgia, interestingly, usually conceded to the Republicans, well, I guess since Jimmy Carter ran from Georgia, but nevertheless, it looks like it might be more interesting.",
        "And we had actual votes cast yesterday in Georgia, which you found instructive.",
