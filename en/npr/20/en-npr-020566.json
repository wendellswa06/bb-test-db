        "I mean, people waited many hours through to pass through a metal detector to get into the ballroom of the Duke Energy Center.",
        "They wore buttons with Obama's name on it and t-shirts, and they were standing on their feet shouting and applauding during many of his remarks.",
        "I mean, there's no doubt that there's a sense of pride that people are feeling here, that Obama's candidacy is, for many of them, a civil rights milestone, regardless of where they stand politically, that this civil rights sort of, you know, - his candidacy represents a civil rights milestone, which is a cause for celebration in their minds."
