        "When Bob Dole, in the 1976 vice-presidential debate against Walter Mondale, talked about Democrat wars and all the people who died in Democrat wars, that was supposed to be a put-down of Democrats, but it backfired because it was so - seen as mean-spirited.",
        "And when Reagan, as you said earlier, when Reagan made that comment about Walter Mondale the day before about his opponent's youth and inexperience, it really was a self-deprecating thing about his own age, advanced age.",

        "I mean, in Parliament, they do fire back and forth at each other, and that's not the way things tend to work in America.",
        "But getting back to Ken's point, I think it's very successful to be self-deprecating.",
