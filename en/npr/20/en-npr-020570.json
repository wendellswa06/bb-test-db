        "But going back to 1992, when the Republicans criticized - now Bill Clinton had been the governor of Arkansas, and Al Gore was just, you know, a freshman or first-term senator, the Republicans said that the only foreign policy experience that Bill Clinton had was when they had breakfast once at the International House of Pancakes.",

        "But I wanted to ask you, there's a - you have, Chris, a bunch of quotes from Winston Churchill in this book, and regrettably, not my favorite - or actually, I guess, I'm pleased, because then I can tell you the joke, and the fact of the matter is I've never checked it to find out if it's true, because, well, it's a really good story that during the Casablanca conference, Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt were there, and for the first time, FDR got to meet Charles de Gaulle, the Free French leader who'd been a thorn in Churchill's side for any number of years already.",
        "And after the meeting, de Gaulle leaves the room, and Churchill goes in to see President Roosevelt, and Roosevelt looks at him and says, my God, he really does think he's Joan of Arc, doesn't he?",
        "And Churchill replied, yes, and my generals won't let me burn him."

        "Well, it didn't turn out Dewey's way, and the next morning, the Deweys are at breakfast and he's crestfallen, the worst day of his life, and as a wonderful wife she is, she sidles up next to him and says, well, Tom, is Harry Truman coming over here tonight, or am I going over to his house?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "There's another one along those lines from the famous senator from Maine, Margaret Chase Smith, asked once what she would do if she woke up in the White House one morning.",
