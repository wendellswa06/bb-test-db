        "It's a very bad disease.",
        "It's now believed, or at least it's believed by some people, that exposure to children with natural disease would keep boosting the immune response of adults, and decrease the risk for shingles breaking out.",
        "And so that may be a downside, that maybe now that we're immunizing everybody, adults will not be exposed to children with the disease, and therefore are at greater risk for shingles.",
        "But now the company that makes the vaccine has been testing, and is now marketing a more potent version of the chicken pox vaccine that's designed exclusively for adults to prevent them from ever having shingles.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Syd, have you heard of this phenomenon called chicken pox parties?",
        "In the old days, chicken pox was thought to be so benign that it was thought that well, it would be convenient if you could control when children would get the disease.",
        "And so somebody would break out in chicken pox, and so there'd be a party to expose people.",
        "These days, fortunately, we don't even need to think about that because we can give people the vaccine and prevent the need for that at all.",
