        "The deal would also give Apple priority on Comcast's cable to ensure that it bypasses congestion on the Web.",

        "Thanks.",
        "Happy to be here.",
        "If each of you had to sum up just in a nutshell what this last term did or what was significant about it, what would you say, Nina?",
        "Well, this was a term that remarkably had no race issues, which is where the court has been most conservative.",
        "And instead, it had same-sex marriage.",
        "It preserved Obamacare, and in the end, it looked very much like a liberal court.",
        "Looked like, we'll return to - substance as opposed to appearance in a moment.",
        "Tom Goldstein, in a nutshell, this past term.",
        "I saw the fractures in the court.",
        "I mean, you had conservatives joining the liberals in a variety of cases that gave rise to this, perhaps, optical illusion.",
        "And there were just a huge proportion of very close cases - 5-4, 6-3 - 40 percent of all the cases at the Supreme Court were that close."

        "Let's talk about the Obergefell case first, the one that resulted in Justice Anthony Kennedy joining the Court's four liberals to declare that same-sex marriage is a right protected by the 14th amendment.",
        "What was your sense of what led the court to a position that 15 years ago would've been considered absolutely impossible?",
        "Well, I can't say that I was surprised because the Court has been led by Justice Kennedy, has been driving towards this moment with considerable consistency.",
        "And we have to remember that in 1986 the Supreme Court upheld the law that made it a crime to commit consenting homosexual conduct in the privacy of one's home.",
        "And over the course of that 20 years that followed, Anthony Kennedy wrote every opinion and ultimately reversing that decision, giving more rights to gay and lesbian people and striking down the federal law that barred recognition of same-sex marriages performed in states where they were legal.",
        "And then we come to this moment and I thought it was presumptively probable that he was going to say that there's a right to same-sex marriage.",

        "Why do we learn about the Holocaust?",
        "Is it just so we can make sure nothing like this ever happens again?",
        "Is it because 6 million people died?",
        "Yes, but there's a bigger reason I think.",

        "You got quite a few really strong reactions to your visit to Auschwitz.",
        "Not all of them were positive.",
        "Why do you think there was that response?",
        "Because, again, the way, you know, we get thrust into these situations in the first place is because people can't see past their own color, past their own hate.",
        "And the reason that I brought that up was because people are looking at this as a color issue.",
        "You know, you want to talk about this issue and say, well, why are we still talking about this?",
        "And why is, you know, why are you supporting Jewish people?",
        "And my response has been consistent every time is that this is not about Jewish people.",
        "This is about people.",
        "You know, just because that's their religion, look at what was done to them.",
