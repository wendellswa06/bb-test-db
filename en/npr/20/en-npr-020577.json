        "Inviting Ahmadinejad to Afghanistan, he's your near neighbor - your immediate neighbor with an impact on what happens in Afghanistan.",
        "And the fact is that we had a partnership with Iran when we went into Afghanistan in the beginning.",
        "You know, the Iranians were very helpful to us in helping to remove the Taliban and the Taliban are not friends of the Iranians.",
        "So the Iranians actually have an interest with respect to the outcome there.",
        "And I think it makes sense for him to talk to his neighbor.",
        "It'd make a lot of sense for us, frankly, to be able to talk to the Iranians more directly.",
        "The fact is that Hamid Karzai does have a sense of what the possibilities are for a better relationship with us now.",
        "He was deeply, deeply concerned about Western involvement in the election.",
        "And so he drew his own conclusions from that.",
        "All of this is old, let me emphasize.",
        "But what you're saying then is that whatever pomp and protocol accompanies this visit, it's of substance.",
        "It's important to persuade President Karzai of the U.S.",
        "full acceptance of him.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "As the president of Afghanistan.",
        "It is of substance for that reason.",
        "But, you know, it's important to remember that those complaints that he made referred back to the kinds of hurdles that I was working with him to get over a year ago when we went through the post-election period and he finally accepted the results.",
        "Those were really those arguments and he was referring back to them.",
        "And I think that we're on a decent track now and I have hopes that the efforts that we make in Kandahar, the efforts that President Karzai makes with the peace jirga that is coming up at the end of May, and then a subsequent major summit in Kabul in the summer, all of these are major steps forward in trying to resolve the political differences of Afghanistan.",
        "But when you hear of, say, the great difficulties the Afghans have had in installing a functioning alternative to the Taliban, say in Helmand province after the Taliban had been pushed out by the Marines, is the lesson you take away from that that if only Karzai could get his act together, if only they could be cleaner about governance, they could do it?",
        "Or is Afghanistan simply just not up to the task of governing itself right now?",
        "I don't take either lesson.",
        "I don't believe that a central government run from Kabul is in the Afghan tradition, nor do I accept the notion that people aren't up to doing what they've done for hundreds of years without us.",
        "I'm convinced that if one empowers people locally to be able to resist against this intimidation campaign and terror campaign, and if they have the prospect of jobs and better life and some security, they'll take care of themselves."

        "It takes 60 votes to achieve cloture.",
        "And depending on which side of the aisle youre seeing it from, the 60-vote cloture hurdle has either made the Senate dysfunctional and incapable of legislating or its made it the guardian of minority concerns, in this case the concerns of Republicans.",
        "Ira Shapiro is a former Senate staffer, later a Clinton administration official and now a Washington lawyer who has written about the Senate a great deal.",
        "And first Ira Shapiro, just to validate or dismiss a widely held impression, are Senate Republicans in fact forcing a lot more cloture votes now than ever before?",
        "Robert, its clear that since the Senate went back to Democratic control, there has been a large spike in cloture votes.",
        "They are much higher since 2006 than they had ever been before, and by orders of magnitude higher.",
        "Orders of magnitude, meaning you used to get how many cloture votes?"

        "Okay, the thing we wanted to measure was the color of this Big Bang radiation to see if it really matched the predictions of the Big Bang theory.",
        "So the question that existed a long time ago, when we started off, was: is the Big Bang theory even the right theory for the universe?",
        "And the competing theory was called the Steady State theory, that held that although it looks like it's expanding, it didn't really have a beginning; it's always been going on and then replenished as things went.",
        "So our test was to see did the radiation match the Big Bang picture or not?",
        "And the answer was, yes, it's effectively perfect, the - almost most perfect agreement we could ever get with this kind of test.",
        "It's a few parts per million, 50 parts per million agreement, which is extraordinary.",
        "Wow.",
        "So there was no alternative in the end to that explanation.",
        "We've only got this one answer that fits the data.",
        "And I've read that - I mean KOBE was launched in 1989, after some delay and frustration I know.",
        "And I've read that the data that showed this curve that you're describing was available very soon after launch, is that true?"

        "That's right.",

        "And one morning I came in and my colleagues had signed the interferogram and said this is it, are you ready to go?",
        "And so it just took a few more weeks after that to get the data checked out and ready to show our astronomer colleagues.",
        "Then it took quite a few more years to get all the way down to 50 parts per million.",

        "Sure.",
        "I wonder if I can go back to Dr. Smoot.",
        "I mean what do the current set of instruments do to help complete the picture that KOBE presented to you?",
        "What basically KOBE did was through John's instrument it showed that it - we knew what the radiation was and what its origin was; and then through my team's instrument that there were these fluctuations that we think were going to become the seeds of the galaxies, but were an indication of the universe began and that people exploited them by measuring them.",
        "With more sensitivity and much (unintelligible) scale, they would be able to actually see how the universe was responding to its initial conditions and be able to sort out, you know, what the universe was made out of and how it was developing.",
        "And that's what - there's been a series of balloon-born and ground-based, especially the WMAP satellite, and eventually the (unintelligible) satellite in a year or two, that are going to continue to exploit this and really get us to understand what the basic parameters are.",
        "We think there are about 15 parameters that describe the universe very well in a physically average sense.",

        "Sometimes I read where scientists say it happened everywhere all at once.",
        "Other times I read where its origin was an infinitesimally small point, but if there was nothing outside of that point, what's there to size it by?",
        "That's one of those…",

        "Yeah.",

        "And the sort of short version is, the whole universe that we can see now was indeed compressed into a tiny volume, but we're inside it, you know, we only can see from inside it.",
        "So this tiny volume included us, whatever the things were that made us eventually.",
        "So we don't know what's outside this volume, if there is indeed, but we imagine, and theory says it's possible, that it goes on forever.",

        "Yes, I think so.",
        "The bridge is 364.4 plus one ear long.",

        "He was the shortest pledge in his fraternity and they - they made the other pledges, you know, use him as a measuring stick to measure the length across the bridge.",

        "Oh, it's been a mystery for years and years, ever since the COBE (unintelligible) I've been curious if it was the same Smoot.",
        "But at least it's all in the family."
