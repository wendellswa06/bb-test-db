        "I was calling to say congratulations first, and then I also had the question of how frequently do theoretical astrophysicists win the award versus experimentalists?",
        "Hmm.",
        "Well, these gentlemen are probably just getting to terms with the fact that they've joined this band of people, but maybe one of them has a answer - John Mather perhaps?",

        "George Smoot, do you think that's...",

        "Well, I think that astrophysics, especially cosmology, is such a young science that it will be awhile before the theories are sufficiently proven that they, you know, the Nobel Committee is confident that they can give the prize and have it be correct.",

        "I guess you're going to have to leave in a couple of minutes I understand, Dr. Smoot, and I appreciate your taking the time.",

        "Well, I just have to ask, because everybody is always curious and you probably answered this a million times, but, you know, what was it like when you got the call?",
