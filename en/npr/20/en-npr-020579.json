        "From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY, and I am Joe Palca.",
        "We're talking this hour about this year's Nobel Prizes, and right now we're talking with John Mather, winner - with George Smoot - of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics.",
        "He's also a senior astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.",
        "And I guess we said Dr. Smoot had to go to class.",
        "But Dr. Mather, I wanted to ask you - you're now working on the new - the replacement for the Hubble Space Telescope.",
        "How is that going to take this story forward?",
        "Good question.",
        "We are planning to build this so that we can see the very first stars and galaxies that lit up after the Big Bang, so that's one of our key topics.",
        "And the telescope will also be amazingly powerful for measurements of galaxies turning stars on, for stars forming, for planets forming around stars, even for discovering how we might possibly have come to exist here on Earth - how a planet like Earth could come to support life.",
        "There's just been a whole wealth of new planets that, I guess, the current space telescope has discovered.",
        "What do you think that's going to tell us about?",
        "I mean I guess it pushes us back a little bit further from the center of the universe that we on Earth used to think we were.",
        "Yeah, I think our center of the universe is still us for us.",
        "But we can hardly think that we're alone anymore.",
        "There are certainly planets out there in great numbers, and presumably there are some like our own planet, but we don't know where they are yet.",
        "OK, let's take one more call now and go to Katherine(ph) in Moraga, California.",
        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Katherine.",
        "Oh, thank you so much for taking my call.",
        "You're welcome."

        "I suspect that I'm like probably the majority of the listeners, where we're just fascinated by this.",
        "It's intriguing.",
        "It's really just - but, you know, most of us don't even, you know, know how to add a checkbook for numbers, much less know physics and all that.",
        "And we see the pictures from the Hubble Space, you know, satellite, and it's like…",
        "Could you quantify for us, or verbalize for us, what the beginning - how do you quantify that for someone that knows nothing about what you do as a profession, but we see so many and hear so much about it?",
        "How would - what does the beginning look like, or how would you tell new students about - to quantify that in their heads, like wrap around it?",
        "Wow, great question, Katherine.",
        "Oh, you know, it's so extreme that it's impossible to have a big enough, extreme enough word.",
        "The entire universe of everything we can see for billions of light years around us compressed into the size of a billiard ball?",
        "Well, that's extreme, but I can't make it sound anymore extreme.",
        "It's the most.",
        "It's the ultimate.",
        "So it's the biggest bang that we could imagine, and so...",
        "So does it start from like black nothing and then became - I mean...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "We don't know.",
        "This is the biggest mystery, too.",
        "There's just no way to tell what's out there on the other side of it if there was another side of it or even to know if this is the only universe.",
        "OK.",
        "There could be many of them.",
        "Katherine, you know, you're asking the most appropriate and most difficult questions probably that anyone could answer.",
        "But I really appreciate that you took the time to call because that's sort of - it's one of the things about these prizes, that they provide such an interesting time to let people get interested in science.",
        "And so, you know, what do you - I was going to ask, John Mather, how are you planning to use this?",
        "Because I know a lot of Nobel winners have gone on to get very interested in public understanding of science after they won their prizes."

        "Well...",
        "Clearly, the public is fascinated with what we do, and we'd like to help them understand.",
        "That's great.",
        "And I guess, since I asked Dr. Smoot, I should ask you as well.",
        "How did you hear from the committee, the Nobel Committee?",
        "Well, I got a phone call at a quarter of six in the morning in Eastern time here, and I was amazed.",
        "There's just no possibility of really knowing if such a thing would ever happen.",
        "People have been telling us for years that it should happen, but you know, you look at the lists of what people have done before in other fields of physics, and it's just astonishing what people have done.",
        "So I never dreamed that I would really be one of those people."

        "That's when cells take the information stored in genes and use that information as a blueprint for making proteins.",
        "Dr. Kornberg and his colleagues were the first to create an actual picture of that process with a resolution so sharp that separate atoms are visible.",
        "Now we're sort of in a funny position here, because Dr. Kornberg was in Pittsburgh yesterday, and he flew back to California early this morning.",
        "And he's, as we understand it, heading for his office.",
        "And so, it's even possible that in the middle of the next few minutes he'll show up in his office and we'll have a chance to talk to him.",
        "But in the meantime, his colleague, David Bushnell has agreed to talk with us about Dr. Kornberg's work.",
        "And Dr. Bushnell is a research associate in Roger Kornberg's laboratory at Stanford University's School of Medicine, in Stanford, California.",
        "So, David Bushnell, thanks for joining us.",
        "Oh, it's really my pleasure.",
        "I'm thrilled to be talking to you on this occasion.",
        "I can imag - it's kind of - I guess, you know - having toiled in a lab myself, at one point, it's hard to know that life exists outside the lab, sometime.",
        "And when it's brought to you this graphically, I'm sure it's quite a wakeup call.",
        "Well, it was very amusing to see the media circus here on Wednesday.",
        "Usually we're toiling away in obscurity.",
        "And those of us, sort of on the fringes of Roger, were getting interviewed and photographed - and even some of us ended up on the - at least the local news.",
        "Well, now you've made national news, this is great.",
        "I'm very happy."

        "OK.",
        "Well, maybe we could get you to go back and - I mean this is another topic - very - this is not one of those things in chemistry that people can finish the sentence by saying: and this is could lead to a cure for this or a cure for that.",
        "It's one of these very, very basic parts of biology that is critical for understanding how genes work, but a little bit hard, maybe, for people to visualize.",
        "Have you come up with good metaphors to explain what this work is about?",
        "Oh, God no.",
        "Oh, we called the wrong person.",
        "In fact, the - probably the best metaphor is one I would steal from Nova, where they were, in fact, talking about RNAi.",
        "Where you can think of biology - the three major macromolecules in biology.",
        "The DNA on one side, which is the information storage.",
        "Protein on the other, which is the machinery that does all the work.",
        "And they can't talk to each other directly, because the DNA is sequestered in the cell.",
        "And so the analogy they used on this Nova program, was, you can think of the DNA as the cookbook and the protein are cooks.",
        "But the cookbooks are stored away, locked in a tower that no one can really get to.",
        "And in order to communicate, you need to have some scribes transcribing these recipes and throwing them out the window.",
        "And so, what we work on is that step of writing the recipes and how - which recipe gets chosen and, in fact how it gets written out.",
        "I just - I saw the Nova program you're referring to and I can't resist complimenting my colleague, Robert Krulwich, because he was actually the presenter on that program - and I thought that was a brilliant description and I'm glad to hear that you thought it was…",
        "The best one I've seen and refer people to it all the time, because it is a very brilliant analogy and one many people can grasp easily.",
        "Yeah, because there's this great thing of the scribe throwing the recipes out the window where they're caught by the cooks down below.",
        "Exactly.",
        "But, why is this considered chemistry?",
        "This is a Nobel Prize in chemistry we're talking about, and not biology."
