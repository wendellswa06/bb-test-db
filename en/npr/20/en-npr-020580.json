        "It's electrostatics, it's hydrogen bonds, it's Vanderwall forces.",
        "This is really all understandable through chemistry.",
        "It's still very complex, so we can't completely model it at this point, but hopefully we'll be able to.",
        "I suppose this is where the chemical world, as defined by bonds and interactions between atoms starts to shift into the living world, and I guess that's a shift that a lot of people are very interested in.",
        "Absolutely, and it's a very, very critical shift.",

        "Otherwise, what is the reference to the basic work?",
        "Well, William, actually were talking with David Bushnell.",
        "And there is a chance still that Roger Kornberg might join us.",
        "But maybe you can answer that question, David Bushnell.",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "The depository for the actual coordinates for the atoms is this protein databank which is maintained by Rutgers, and it's publicly available to anyone.",
        "You can actually download the coordinates and view them on your own computer with any number of programs and play with these molecules yourself.",

        "Protein Data Bank - I think it's PDB.org I'm not - I always use Google or something to find it.",

        "Well, there was one several years ago that was put out by Stanford Press when we had - the science papers were published.",
        "I believe that is still available on Stanford's Web site.",
        "I'm not 100 percent certain - I am not aware of any sort of popular science.",

        "And you know he's the sort of the CEO; he's the one who puts the team together, he has the big ideas.",

        "Hi.",
        "Yeah, I was wondering if this was at all related to some of the studies going on about protein folding and whether or not that's kind of going to look into the futures maybe evolutionary medicine; or if you guys have kind of found that through doing a lot of this you guys fell into a more intelligent design because of the way this thing is structured and the way that proteins fold and have to be so meticulous for those things that's it's, you know, possible - impossible that it's chance.",

        "I think we can figure it someday.",
        "There are evolutionary hints that tie it to other structures along the way.",

        "So, happily, we think of ourselves as more complicated than a bacteria, and at least when it comes to transcribing DNA we are.",
        "We are, but it mostly comes down to the regulation of transcription as opposed to the - if you look right at the active site, right where the specific chemistry is happening where the RNA is being made, they are virtually identical.",
        "But as you get farther and farther away, variations occur.",
        "But you can start to look at evolutionary relationship, and there is even some evidence now that there is potentially, very far back in a more simple organisms, very similar things, very similar - my God, my mind's (unintelligible).",
        "It's too many interviews in too short of time.",
        "Well, I haven't been giving that many interviews (unintelligible).",
        "Like for instance smallpox, which is considered - or vaccinia, which is considered a simpler organism, at least at it's core it's polymerase is remarkably similar to baker's yeast.",
        "And so I do think there are steps that could have followed, and it's one of the these where we know from mutation studies you can cause a lot of damage and it'll still work to some extent."
