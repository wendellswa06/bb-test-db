        "Well, if I had any answer, I would be a famous philosopher instead of a mathematician.",
        "I mean, it's a very difficult question.",
        "And people have been arguing about it for a really long time.",
        "Anyway, I guess I wanted to say that the personal reason is maybe it's one of the rewards of working as a science writer for as long as I have that you get to meet these really interesting people along the way.",
        "And Andy Fire and I have had a couple of really fascinating conversations in the last couple of years.",
        "And it's a really a delight to hear that you've won this prize, and I guess, you know - I'm sure it will change nothing and change everything.",
        "Or maybe I'm wrong; maybe you can tell me.",
        "I don't know.",
        "It's an interesting adventure.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, let's start I guess as is always necessary to sort of sketch the landscape before the insight.",
        "What were you looking for or at that brought you to this observation of RNA interference?",
        "Well, I could start by sketching the landscape.",
        "Even before I was looking at anything, people had been trying to do a very simple experiment in plants, and to some extent in fungi; which is say, if we want more of a given protein, we ought to put more of the gene in and see what happens.",
        "So they did that.",
        "And what they found was that occasionally the experiment worked, but usually not only did it not work but you put more of the gene in and you got less of the protein.",
        "And in fact some of the experiments were done in petunias where people - Rich Jorgensen was one the people that did this and Jan Mole(ph) was another - they would put a gene into a petunia to make it more pink and it would get white.",
        "And so what was happening was that the cell was responding to that extra information not by expressing it, not by turning it way up, but by treating it as a challenge, treating it as a statement that something was too active, something was making too much of a good thing, or at least that was the original model.",
        "And the cell then knew that there was a problem there.",
        "And instead of dumbly just making more of it, it actually shut it down.",
        "And this shutting down - well, okay.",
        "So what was the observation that made you realize that it was a shutting down mechanism or where was the shutting down taking place?",
        "Well, other people then took up this work - and again this is before we actually were doing very much on it - other people took it up in the plant field and they showed that the gene was still transcribed that was targeted by this mechanism, that was still making RNA; but that very shortly after the RNA was made it was degraded.",
        "And so there was some way of the cell sensing that a certain kind of RNA was not doing the think job it should in the cell, and when it sensed that it would go ahead and degrade it.",
        "Okay.",
        "And so you're not working in petunia's, you're working in the C elegans, which is a little worm.",
        "So how did you go about investigating this process in C elgans?",
        "Well, one of the challenges in the plant system was that they were putting in extra DNA and seeing this process and had pretty much worked out that there was some kind of RNA that was produced that was mediating the silencing, mediating the shut off.",
        "But it was really hard to figure out what the RNA was.",
        "And so there's another key experiment, also not one that we did.",
        "It was one done by Sue Guo, who was a graduate student at the time in Cornell.",
        "And what Sue did is that she injected not a DNA molecule to make extra bits of a gene but actually an RNA molecule that should have give you extra translation, extra production of a protein.",
        "And she saw the same effect.",
        "So she could actually mimic this effect without the DNA kind of complexity of it, by just injecting an RNA."

        "And what that meant is it really, definitively confirmed that this was an RNA-triggered process, as we call it.",
        "And it almost meant, experimentally, that we in the worm - doing our experiments in the worm - could put in any kind of RNA that we wanted and do a very quick assay to see if we were shutting off gene expression.",
        "And that really allowed it, although it took a couple of years to get all the details settled of what to look for.",
        "That allowed us to ask a very straightforward question - Craig Mello's group and our group - to ask the question of what structure in the injected RNA was really important for the gene silencing.",
        "And I guess the idea is that once, I mean C.",
        "elegans is a nice organism to work with because a lot of genes that are in there have been worked out.",
        "So once you know the gene, you can make the piece of RNA - interfering RNA - that will stop that gene from doing its job.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Yeah, it's a great thing.",
        "It might take an afternoon to make the RNA, or actually probably now there are techniques where it might take an hour or two to make the RNA.",
        "And then you inject a worm, and within a couple of days, you're looking at worm that that particular gene is knocked down in.",
        "And you talked about two groups, and I know you and Craig Mello have been jointly awarded this, but how was that collaboration-competition working?",
        "You were at Carnegie Institute of Washington, and he was at MIT.",
        "Is that right?",
        "No, he was at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.",
        "Actually, University of Massachusetts, Worchester.",
        "Worchester, sorry.",
        "Thanks, Bill, I never would've been forgiven by them if I had gotten that wrong.",
        "So Craig and I had talked for years, about how DNA, or later RNA, that was put into worms had these sort of amazing effects and unusual, unexpected - sometimes positive, sometimes negative - things.",
        "So we really had had a collaboration that was just based on really talking about the science behind it.",
        "And we had, in fact, previously collaborated on a number of papers, and of course the two labs also did their own work.",
        "And so we would go back and forth between collaborations and independent projects in the two groups, which has continued over the years.",
        "So it was a really exciting point at which they had gotten to a stage with the work and then we came in with a little bit different expertise, and I think the combination of those two was what led to just a piece of the puzzle being put in, which was the double-stranded character of the trigger.",
        "Jordan Ellenberg teaches mathematics at the University of Wisconsin.",
        "He wrote the book, \"\"How Not To Be Wrong.\"\" But on this question, it's evidently hard to be right.",
        "And we kind of put that out as a paper.",
        "And then, we knew a little bit would happen from that, but there was a really remarkable explosion within a few years of different people with all sorts of other expertise coming into the field and making it happen as a technique and also as a scientific investigation area, much more broadly than in the little roundworm."

        "But the public support in the form of NIH funding for basic research on - in this field and in a lot of other fields has been very good over the years, and that's really what's made the work possible.",
        "Somebody realized at some point that if you supported biologists investigating questions in the way that they thought was useful - which often is not to do an experiment in a live person, of course, but to do it in a plant or in a nematode or in a fungus - that you could get answers out that would eventually lead to significant improvements for us.",

        "So in fact, this whole issue of how genes are regulated is a very rich field, and there is regulation at the level of cells decide - don't transcribe it in the first place.",
        "They modify the chromosome in an area to simply shut it down or make inaccessible.",
        "That's probably the most abundant form of regulation, actually.",
        "And another form of regulation that the RNA interference is a small part of is cases where RNA's transcripts are now made, and you want to shut them down by degrading them.",
        "Now that having been said, there's a fascinating process that's been very well-documents in plants and sort of suggested in other systems, whereby if there's RNA interference going on, there is some ability of that process to then feed back and tell the chromosome not to make quite so much of what it's making.",
        "So the chromosome actually is smart enough to realize that it's making bad stuff and shut it down.",

        "Yes, thank you.",
        "My question is if Dr. Fire could comment on any information about curing macular degeneration or - currently, I mean, right now, if there's anything - any research going on with real subjects.",
        "So the question is about a disease called macular degeneration, and there is research going on with that.",
        "It's not gotten to the stage where it's an approved treatment for general use, but there are clinical trials going on with the idea of using RNA as a tool - RNAi in particular - as a tool to block the angiogenesis, to block the blood-vessel formation that's part of the process.",
        "Right.",
        "Maybe we should just explain to people what macular degeneration is.",
        "It's a breakdown of the ability of the back of the eyeball to make sense of the visual signals that are coming in, and it's related to this explosion of blood vessels that build up in the back of the eyes.",
        "I think that's a reasonably close description.",
        "That sounds good.",
        "And I should say I'm not an expert on it.",
        "What Joe said is actually more than what I know.",
        "But why would switching off a gene in theory be a useful thing for treating a disease like that.",
        "Well, if you can block the vacuolization, the blood-vessel explosion, as you described it, then it turns out you can actually block the progress of the disease.",
        "There's probably some underlying problems in the eye, but really the main thing is to keep those blood vessels from forming, and you can actually keep people's vision going."

        "And so there are a couple of different approaches, not just the RNAi approach, but a couple of different approaches to blocking angiogenesis.",
        "And the hope is that those things can provide, at some point, a treatment.",
        "And my impression from the early clinical data from the two groups that are doing it is they can safely put double-stranded RNA into the eye and that the early clinical data was encouraging.",

        "What issue were you thinking about bringing to people's attention?",
        "Well, it's, you know, it's been kind of an interesting week.",

        "That's not me, necessarily, bringing that forward.",
        "That's the whole scientific community that's been involved in this field over the years.",

        "The decisions that we make are not - that the country makes are not decisions of science all the time, they're decisions of policy - what people need.",
        "But science can certainly inform that, and that's a goal and role that prominent scientists have is to really facilitate the right expert being available to the people making decisions.",
