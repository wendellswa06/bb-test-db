        "Should the Weather Service use descriptive words, as in rain is likely, or percent probabilities, as in 70 percent chance of rain, or icons - say, a picture of a cloud with a few raindrops?",
        "Honestly, I think all three.",
        "We've been doing some research lately.",

        "Well, Jason Samenow, the chief meteorologist with the Washington Post's Capital Weather Gang, says, that varies.",
        "So he attaches a confidence level to his forecasts.",
        "Samenow may say, there's a 20 to 30 percent chance of evening showers and storms - confidence medium to high.",
        "The forecast models - they give these probabilities.",
        "But obviously, the farther you go out in time, the less skill or accuracy these models have.",
        "And so our confidence in those probabilities tends to, over time, especially as you get out to three, four, five days in the future - tends to decrease.",
        "And sometimes with particularly complex weather set ups, our confidence in those probabilities are even lower.",
        "So, you know, for complicated snowstorms, we might have just a low to medium confidence of what the models are simulating within 12 to 24 hours.",
        "But typically what happens is we have fairly high confidence out to 36 to 48 hours, and then, gradually, our forecast confidence declines.",
        "And basically, once we get to seven to ten days, we have very little to no confidence.",

        "And everyone knows how obnoxious it can be to hear cell phone rings in public.",

        "These are scientists who study the effect that sounds have on the ear and the psyche, and they determined a list of characteristics that a non-imposing cell phone ring would have.",
        "Then we put them together with the sound engineer, and he composed four rings that I think people would find are not just scientifically but to their ears the most palatable.",
