        "The government in Kiev has declared this referendum illegal, but the area is already controlled by pro-Russian forces.",

        "Whether they're like trenches or whether to block tanks, I don't know.",
        "We talked to some of the soldiers that are there, posted.",
        "Everybody said they're there for the same reasons, to defend Crimea against what they see as an illegitimate government in Kiev, the revolutionary government.",
        "The question though is: Why such firepower?",
        "They like to make fun of the Ukrainian military.",
        "Of course, the Ukrainian military is not nearly as strong as the Russian military.",
        "So why this tremendous amount of firepower?",
        "Is it - do they expect a war, or is it just a show of force?",
        "Well, and we should say that acting government in Kiev, they are saying very much the opposite, that it's this vote and this referendum coming on Sunday that is illegitimate.",
        "And they're concerned that you're seeing just the beginning of something, that there are Russian troops building across the border in Russia right now - not just troops, but long-range missiles.",
        "I mean, what do you know about that?",
        "Well, look, I mean, here in Kiev, people will say the Russians are only three hours away, and they think the Russians are coming, very seriously.",
        "However, we should also say that Crimea is a special case.",
        "I mean, even before all this revolutionary action that took place in Kiev, there was a separatist movement in Crimea, and Russia had a deep interest in claiming it for its own, or at least claiming it as not part of Ukraine.",
        "That's actually been a big issue since the breakup the Soviet Union.",
        "So, you know, there are signs that this could lead to war.",
        "However, it could end with Crimea being its own special case, and we'll have to see after Sunday."
