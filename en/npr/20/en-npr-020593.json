        "You have taken new territory, cleared it, secured it, and held it.",
        "This is a critical part of our strategy and of the current campaign, and you have been enormously successful.",

        "So the octopus doesn't use that great brain to tell arm one to turn purple and arm two to turn blue as it swims over a coral reef, but rather, millions of cells spread across its body are each individually responding to that change in their environment and then giving camouflage to the octopus as a whole.",
