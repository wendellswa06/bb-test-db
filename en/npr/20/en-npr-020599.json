        "The inner logic of the tavern rabble-rousers was in fact what produced the early American public sphere.",
        "And after the revolution, America continued to redefine itself in that same space, be it the country's numerous taverns, saloons, juke joints, grog shots, blind pigs, speakeasies, nightclubs and eventually post-Prohibition bars of all stripes.",

        "In fact, the very first British colonists who arrived in the New World had one immediate priority, to build taverns right away.",

        "I think that might be their greatest role.",
        "You take us, obviously, to the beginnings of the American Revolution and a lot of what happens, right, the - sort of the outrage after the Stamp Act was introduced, the planning of the Boston Tea Party, these take place in houses of drink.",
        "It's kind of stunning to see just how much does take place there.",
        "And the tavern is this great place that you can use for all of these wonderful things but it's also where people start to talk about what they're unhappy about.",
        "The tavern is really considered the cradle of the revolution.",
        "And this was where people organized.",
        "This is where people aired their grievances.",
        "This is where people spread political propaganda.",
        "People strategized, recruited, and, I mean, it's really quite fantastic everything that happened in many, many taverns for, say, about 65 years leading up to the Revolution.",
        "Obviously, taverns became a gathering point for political parties.",
        "And machine politics really starts to kind of grow out of some of these bars and saloons, particularly in the Northeast, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It becomes a real problem.",
        "And I think to some degree you could argue that machine politics begins as early as the 1720s with the establishment of the early Boston caucus.",
        "But it becomes entrenched in the 19th century, and that's part of what everybody gets really concerned about, which is this idea that the rum, Romanism and rebellion that comes out of the saloons and that the political system is being completely controlled in major urban centers by the buying of votes through alcohol."
