        "The problems don't seem so fraught in the South until about the turn of the century, and then there's a real concern rising up out of the union of the Ku Klux Klan and the Anti-Saloon League and a real kind of a hysteria over the idea that African-Americans are using saloons as places to kind of gather political power.",
        "The movement to ban alcohol in America really particularly affected immigrant groups because, as you write, the pub was really one of the few places where communities from the old country, so to speak, could come and gather and reconnect.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Isn't it?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And you get this sense of how tiny and claustrophobic and crowded and awful these spaces are, and then you imagine what it would be like to go out into the saloon, into this public space that is relatively spacious compared with where you're living or where you're working or, you know, even the crowded streets - that you have this sort of respite from the grind of daily life and how important that public space must've been to people.",
        "And especially you're working six days a week and you only have Sunday off, and that's your one day, and all of sudden, there are these groups who are rooting for closings on Sundays.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You write that the gay liberation movement could not have happened without bars, without pubs.",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "It's a very, very important space for the gay community during the late '40s and 1950's as there was a crackdown on sort of this family value, an early kind of family values campaign.",
        "You start to see the gay community really persecuted.",
        "And so gay bars don't start off as a political thing, an overtly political thing, but they wind up becoming very important centers for people to get to meet each other.",
        "Of course, they're also harassed by the police, and they're shut down.",
        "The average lifespan of a bar in San Francisco was about 6 months in the early 1960's and they would get shut down by police.",
        "In New York, they were run by the mob.",
        "Of course, the Stonewall Inn was run by the mob, which is where the Stonewall riots happened, the thing that sparked the gay pride revolution.",
        "And that essentially could only have happened because bars and pubs were places where gay men felt comfortable congregating.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "And so I think that's really what my book is arguing, is that taverns and saloons and bars used by various groups are really important in terms of freedom of association which I think is perhaps the whole point of freedom in some ways.",
        "I think it's the whole sense that we have the right to congregate, to associate, and to affect political change.",
        "And that, I think, is really born in the bar.",
        "And it's sort of - it's the place where we try to keep it alive.",
        "The tavern, the saloon, my neighborhood bar is where I go when I have a problem, frequently.",
        "And I know a lot of people there, and frequently, they'll help me out.",
        "And I think if you think about the tavern and the saloon in that way today, then you wonder what you would be cutting out if we lost something like that",
        "That's Christine Sismondo.",
