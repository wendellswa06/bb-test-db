        "I think the United States is getting itself involved in a deeper and deeper conflict which it fundamentally misunderstands, and if it persists in the policies in which it has embarked, and worse, if it widens the scale of that conflict in the Middle East and in the Persian Gulf region, then I do not see how the United States will win.",
        "On the contrary, I think we're going to get stuck in quicksand.",
