        "You have a vital, energetic, young movement that involves people literally putting themselves at risk, marching in the streets, defying the bitter segregationists, sometimes violent segregationists - the likes of Bull Connor.",
        "And so this is a vibrant, romantic even, movement.",
        "But as that movement ages, and I think we've come to the point where it's an aged, graying revolution, as I would call it, and a lot of these people have just simply held onto power.",
        "And so they have, in essence, delayed the maturation of this younger generation of black leadership.",
        "When you talk about holding on to power, are you saying that a lot of black office-holders have focused more on the political benefits to them of being in power and less on changing the country?",
        "Without a doubt.",
        "But it's...",
        "I mean, is the word corrupt too strong a term to use here?",
        "No.",
        "The word corrupt, for some people, not all, the focus, the spotlight turns on some.",
        "And so you get people like a Sharpe James in Newark, or you get a Marion Barry in Washington.",
        "Two long-time mayors who were criticized...",
        "Two long-time mayors who had many people in their cabinet, in their government, go to jail for corrupt activity.",
        "You in this book write quite a lot about the Reverend Al Sharpton, who, as many people know, started his career as a very controversial civil rights activist.",
        "The standard story is that over time he cleaned up his act somewhat.",
        "He became a much more respected and accepted figure and even ran for president in 2004.",
        "It is true that Mr. Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, after which there was a commitment to give 40 acres and a mule.",
        "We never got the 40 acres.",
        "We didn't get the mule.",
        "So we decided we'd ride this donkey as far as it would take us."

        "That's the standard story, but you write, nope, still a fraud.",
        "We have a tradition of great leadership in the black community.",
        "But when you start to talk about people like Sharpton, I think that they see an opportunity to simply, you know, kind of like a pale reflection of that past leadership, and for the most part, it's about personal ambition.",
        "If Sharpton, as your book alleges, takes money from some company to go to homeless shelters, hire homeless people to go out and demonstrate and do this bogus demonstration, does that really make him any different from other politicians in America right now?",
        "No, but that's my point, Steve.",
        "You know, when we talk about the civil rights movement, when we talk about black leadership over the history of the country, we're talking about people who aren't simply playing politics but are speaking to the American essence, these - the tradition of what I would call idealism, of uplift and empowerment and how people achieve social change.",
        "How you can make a difference for someone in this country and for yourself in your community.",
        "And instead, if they're behaving just like other politicians, if it just becomes a matter of ward politics and patronage, then you have basically lowered yourself.",
        "Bill Cosby, in his famous speech on the 50th anniversary of Brown, speaks about there being now people who are making money off of mismanaging you.",
        "He's speaking to black people in the country, saying, you know, there are these mayors and others involved with getting funding from government agencies or money from foundations and the like, people who can even get elected on the basis of saying to people, stay in your plight, don't find a way out, I'm not going to stand up and say that we need better schools and make schools that work; instead, I'm going to make it out to be that, you know, genuine blackness is being downtrodden and having this victimized mindset.",

        "And Thomas Jefferson came to the fore.",
        "And there was really no way for Americans to handle the intense divisions among them without political parties organizing those disputes.",

        "For example, the idea that politics is all driven by machines - you need some kind of nonpartisan panels to handle our affairs, instead.",
        "Right.",
        "That's one way that it's come up.",
        "But it's really an intense distrust of politics itself, really.",

        "There's a downside to party politics.",
        "And Americans too often see the downside as the essence of what politics is about, and mistakenly so, because as you can see in American history, all of the really truly important changes which people honor as the great breakthroughs in American history - all the way back to Thomas Jefferson, and onto Abraham Lincoln, and onto FDR.",
        "All of those were completed by party politicians.",
        "You know, it took someone to be a party politician to understand how to get things done.",
        "You write about Abraham Lincoln as a very good party politician.",
        "But you also write about his relationship with the abolitionist Frederick Douglass.",
        "And you acknowledge that it has been common among historians to see Douglass as the inspired, demanding progressive outsider and Lincoln as the cautious pall whose aversion to slavery was less than absolute.",
        "You say that that's backwards.",
        "Yeah, it is backwards.",
        "I mean, and it's typical of what's become of the writing of American history these days.",
        "Politicians are on the outs, and outsiders - agitators - are on the ins, as it were.",
        "With a case of Douglass and Lincoln, Lincoln from the very beginning ran for the presidency on a platform that was devoted to bringing slavery to an end.",
