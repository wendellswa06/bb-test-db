        "But in your reading of American history, do you see any obvious precedent for Trump, anything remotely like this that we're seeing this year?",

        "But what we are really seeing though I think is something we have seen before, which is the disintegration of the modern Republican Party under all of the stress and strains for all of the reasons that we just talked about.",

        "That success looks even better when you compare it with what Russia's army looked like the last time it was in action, during the Georgian War in 2008.",
        "Its victory was marred by embarrassing technical and mechanical failures, poor coordination, and indiscipline on the part of badly trained troops."

        "Now we understand, we also supposed to care about the soldier because there are not enough of them.",

        "Still, he says, modernization has a long way to go.",
        "Obviously, such big machine could not be reformed in such short period of time, but some important things were done.",

        "Felgenhauer says that half the draftees are ready to be discharged, so unless Russia acts by the middle of May, the army won't be fully combat-ready again until sometime in August.",
        "And that, he says, could give Ukraine the time it needs to bring its own outdated and demoralized military up to fighting strength that would make it a much more dangerous opponent for Russia."

        "And one thing you obviously want to factor in, if you're doing this calculation correctly, which we wanted to, was the toll rate, and we realized we don't really know how much we pay in tolls on the same trip, from Boston to New York each time.",
        "And that's what got me thinking about what that might - what affect that might have on what toll rates are, or more generally, if you're less aware of your taxes, how the government might respond in terms of setting tax rates.",
        "And I gather, what you found, if I understand this, is that once an automatic toll paying system, like EZ-Pass, is installed, typically, you can expect the tolls to go up on that bridge or highway or tunnel.",

        "Particularly, as the fraction of drivers using electronic toll collection like EZ-Pass increases.",
        "On the other hand, if a highway or a bridge or a tunnel has already -automates toll-taking, you'd think that its cost would go down because they're employing fewer people to take the tolls.",
        "That's right.",
        "It is certainly cost saving.",
        "On the other hand, it may make it easier to raise revenue to repave the road or extend the road because people are less aware of how much they're paying in tolls.",
        "And you suspect - although this would be harder to quantify obviously -that consumer or public resistance to increasing the tolls is minimized because the money is leaving our bank accounts so stealthily via EZ-Pass.",

        "And you've found that people who had paid using cash were much better able to say how much they had recently paid on the toll than people who had paid using EZ-Pass or Fast Lane."
