        "And, my gosh, you've had an interesting careers.",

        "I'd seemed to emerge from medical school with a qualification but nevertheless, I seemed to know nothing and was so scared and...",
        "(Laughter) Forgive me, I'm so glad I didn't blunder into your practice.",
        "Well, do you know, patients liked me 'cause I was really jolly and nice and what they didn't realize is they'd probably been much better off with some mumbling introvert who actually knew something.",
        "And in fact, I dreaded it.",
        "And my only happy day as a doctor was one sunny summer day where we got no admissions at all and I sat on the lawn outside the hospital and read \"\"The Longest Journey\"\" by E.",

        "I'm not qualified for anything else.",
        "I thought, the only thing I've done is comedy.",
        "And I applied for and got a job with BBC Light Entertainment in radio.",

        "But that being noted, it must be rough to - a challenge to take a comic approach to the Blitz, which is, in a sense, the great national heroic story of Britain.",
        "It's interesting, isn't it?",
        "I mean, I suppose this is the way I write.",
        "It's not that I see humor in everything but that most people do see humor in even the saddest things.",
        "And what was so extraordinary about the Blitz and what attracted me to it was the idea of ordinary people trying to do ordinary things in an extraordinary situation.",
        "And some of those ordinary things are making jokes, going to the cinema, going to the theater.",
        "And the book before \"\"Crooked Heart\"\" was called \"\"Their Finest Hour And A Half\"\" and that was about the making of a feature film because I very much wanted to write about what it was like to be behind the scenes.",
        "And then I stumbled across a fantastic quote by a pre-war actor which said, once work begins in studio, nothing outside is of any relative importance.",
        "And I thought, gosh, that's so true, but what about during the war when there are actually bombs falling outside?",
        "And I started researching and I discovered that it was no difference at all.",
        "Even in the middle of the Blitz it still took, you know, 12 people to decide the color of the leading man's tie.",
        "It was still ridiculously solipsistic and people still cracked jokes and people still were sarcastic and rude and funny - that didn't change at all.",
        "That's what got them through.",
        "I think it was, yes.",
        "I think that striving for ordinary."
