        "Disney recruited Puerto Ricans for jobs at the park because of their bilingual skills.",
        "Surely, that was the case when I worked in the parks.",
        "John Quinones is commissioner in Osceola County, just east of Disney World.",
        "I used Spanish a lot.",
        "And a lot of the Latin American countries that would come to visit the parks, that would certainly cater to them.",
        "Quinones was 14 when his family moved to the area from Puerto Rico.",
        "He worked in Frontierland, at the Pecos Bill's Cafe, to support himself while he was in college.",
        "As it happened, the opening of Walt Disney World came at a critical time for Puerto Rico.",
        "The 1970s saw the beginning of an economic slowdown on the island that continues to this day.",
        "But Jorge Duany, a professor of anthropology at Miami's Florida International University, says that came after decades of prosperity on the island, an era that greatly expanded the middle class.",
        "And there was a substantial economic growth.",
        "The educational system expanded.",
        "So there was actually a large group of people who were then capable of investing, migrating or at least buying land in Florida, so that either they or their kids could use it later on.",
        "Today, about half of Osceola County is Hispanic, and by far the largest group is Puerto Rican.",
        "Many of the Puerto Ricans here say they came to be with family, some to get away from rising crime.",
        "But many, like Arlene Bonet, came to find work.",
        "Bonet comes from what she describes as a beautiful area on Puerto Rico's southwest coast, a town called Cabo Rojo.",
        "I used to live right on the corner, by the beach.",
        "I used to go every day to the beach and see the sunsets.",
        "Bonet misses those sunsets and the mountains where she'd travel every Sunday to meditate and to practice yoga.",
        "Cabo Rojo is a vacation area, and for many years, she made a good living selling real estate.",
        "But then the economy and the bubble exploded all around the world, and real estate went down, mortgages went down, and business went down, too."

        "To combat a massive budget deficit, Puerto Rico's government laid off thousands of public employees.",
        "Bonet's business was dead, and she saw no signs of when it might come back.",
        "After moving to Central Florida with her daughter, Bonet says finding a job wasn't easy.",
        "But now that she has, she likes the area and has no plans to return to the island.",
        "It's pretty much like a Caribbean island, because it's sunny, it's fresh, it's beautiful.",
        "So, we feel like home.",

        "Two good things here; one - this was decided in a nonpartisan way, which is a good thing, and secondly, Democrats were ready to refuse to cede Harris because of these obligations.",

        "Now everybody can agree on the facts, and they can fight a new election again.",
        "Tiana, does it seem odd to you that President Trump, who has often raised the specter of voter fraud, hasn't tweeted at all about this case?",
        "So I just saw that he finally condemned voter fraud of all kinds, you know, sort of in broad terms.",
        "But, obviously, when you tweet as much as the president does, what he doesn't emphasize says just as much as what he does emphasize.",
        "I think it is good, though, even if only in nominal terms that he does denounce the fact that this was a fairly obvious act of voter deception."
