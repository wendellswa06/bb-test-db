        "You have people wanting to leave, and oftentimes it's the healthy people who leave, and the people who are left behind, they have problems that keep them from being competitive elsewhere."

        "So it does create a public policy problem, but you do see the response that we are currently having, which is that the government will apparently borrow considerable amounts of money and try to stimulate the economy to try to soften this contraction across the country so that the population does not become more desperate than it is or needs to be.",
