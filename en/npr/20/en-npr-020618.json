        "I just wanted to ask Sudir Venkatesh, jobs in the military have become competitive.",
        "They certainly have, and we just heard one of the reasons why, because they offer a number of things, from immediate cash for families that are in need of it to the opportunity to get retrained, to get educated and to have credentialing.",
        "To be able to go out in the world and be able to say that I can work at a job, and I can be responsible, et cetera.",
        "And it's great to hear those stories.",
        "There are not a lot of opportunities for that.",
        "Another example might be teaching, that when people go and get credentialed for teaching, they can often get incentives to teach in communities that are underserved.",
        "And so they might have a stint in a rural community, for example, and then go to a place where they have a preference.",
        "Again, wonderful to hear.",
        "There's just not a lot of places to go to get those kinds of - to get a little bit of help and assistance.",
        "We really need programs and policies that can do that at a scale.",
        "Mika, I wonder, of the men and women you served with, is that a lot of their stories, too?",
        "For a good number of them.",
        "I've got a small chunk of people that actually have thriving businesses and, you know, were making six figures a year and, you know, just decided to join the military.",
        "And of course, they're looking at that pay cut now.",
        "But the biggest thing that we're running into is that with all the budget cuts and everything, we can't keep the same personnel that we had before.",
        "So everybody that's re-enlisting and trying to stay in the military is having a lot of difficulty with that because of the different restrictions, and they can be more choosy now.",
        "And on the other side, you're looking at...",
        "What they call retention figures, people aren't staying in.",

        "Nice to have you with us today.",
        "Good afternoon.",
        "And the common threat here is finding a job.",
        "Clearly, Mika found one in the military, but again that's not an option for all that many people.",
        "That's right, and just to set the context for what we do, the population we work with is really an underclass in society.",
        "Average age is mid-30s.",
        "It's a predominately African-American population.",
        "Eighty-five percent of them come to us unemployed, and most of those have been long-term, chronically unemployed.",
        "Isn't that sort of the definition of underclass, long-term, chronically...?",
        "So that's one quarter no longer migrate.",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "And another definition, I think it's important to bear in mind in terms of the challenge here, is they come with significant number of high barriers to long-term employment success.",
        "So 75 to 80 percent of them are ex-offenders.",
        "Sixty percent of them have addiction histories.",
        "And there are a litany of other barriers that are challenging that we have to work with them to help overcome.",
        "And how do you do that?",
        "Well, the program, it's quite intense.",
        "It takes - it's 12 to 18 months long.",
        "And we measure success by not only helping our participants find jobs, but to keep jobs.",
        "And the ultimate success measure for us is long-term job retention.",
        "So what we do is we provide, basically, a, sort of, multidimensional program."

        "There's a sort of convention hard-skills training program, which would include computer skills and basic reading - sorry, writing skills, math skills and then a lot of career readiness.",
        "The second component, which is the most important part, in my opinion, is our life skills training program, and that's - it's a six- to nine-month very intensive program, we call personal empowerment.",
        "And it's based on the principles of emotional intelligence, and it basically gives our participants the soft skills that they need to succeed on the job and that they lack when they come into the program.",
        "Soft skills like communications with other people?",
        "Well, it's really relationship management skills.",
        "So what we find is participants who come in - and this is based on, you know, the history of our program is we didn't have this component, and we found that we were able to get - help people get jobs, but they were failing on the job at a high rate.",
        "And what we found is they basically didn't have the soft skills, the relationships management skills, to succeed on the job.",
        "And fundamentally, people coming from deep poverty have very damaged belief systems.",
        "So them come in feeling - with very low self-esteem.",
        "They feel victimized.",
        "They place blame.",
        "They don't take responsibility.",
        "And, just, they lack basic skills for regulating emotions.",
        "So all of those factors can lead to behaviors on the job that are quite destructive.",
        "So our program helps to essentially change that picture, starting with developing a better self-awareness, of, you know, why they are where they are, recognizing emotions, their source and what the effects are.",
        "And over time, we help them to develop skills in regulating their emotions.",
        "We help them to develop self-esteem, self-respect...",
        "In this economy, though, all those things are great - this economy, even with those skills, it can't be easy getting them jobs.",
        "Briefly, what's your success rate?",
        "Our success rate is about 60 percent.",
        "Sixty percent, yes, that's fantastic."
