        "Part of the census figures that were released last - recently suggested that there were about 48 million people between 18 and 64 years of age who didn't work even one week last year.",
        "That by itself is quite a large number, and it's up about seven percent.",
        "You can break those down - break that number down by also seeing that a lot of that is in families in which the parents might be poor, the children are unable to find a job and so on.",
        "So there's a little bit of a cycle here, and that can lead to many of the problems that we've just heard about in terms of a household where everyone feels a certain sense of loss of self-esteem.",
        "There's no one there with credit or immediate resources to be able to help another member withstand the bouts of hardship.",
        "And so I think we want to have the qualitative side of this, too, where we see that the texture of living in poverty can be different if you're, you know, just the first person who's - and you've lost a job - not saying that's easy - but it can be a lot different if you're in community where you have multiple generations of poor people.",

        "But we are not one of them.",

        "We really focus very much on the intergenerational poverty issues because those are the deepest, most intractable poverty issues here in terms of helping people get back on their feet and becoming financially independent.",
        "So that's where we focus, and that's how our program is tailored.",
        "I can understand that.",

        "And one of the things that we find is that there is some science behind this transformation.",

        "But I don't see wealth creation in my future.",
        "And that's just sad.",
        "And I look at my son, and it's just not the way I want to raise him.",
        "Ben Mangan, is there anything like your program in New Jersey that you know about?",
        "You know, I believe there are programs like this, but the caller's point begs a different question that's really critical here, and that's the role of public policy in wealth creation.",
        "Because there's a dangerous methodology around the American dream, and it goes something like this: If you work hard enough, you'll get a piece of that dream.",
        "But if you're not getting that dream, it's your own fault.",
        "And the reality is there is a history of public policy that's behind the way we create wealth in this country, and it's very much mattered on - it matters who you are in terms of your ability to accumulate wealth."
