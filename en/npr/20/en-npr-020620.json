        "No problem.",

        "And economists think there was an 11-to-one return on that investment.",
        "And so, you know, even in a time when resources are scarce and there are fierce political battles over how we invest, when you talk about wealth creation, there's a strong argument for a long-term return on investment that benefits all Americans.",

        "Now, an expat driving a 4L gets major street cred - an expat driving a 4L is hardcore with the people - not all high and mighty from behind the wheel of an air-conditioned Land Cruiser.",

        "Soon I was just like any other Malagasy driver, running out of gas going up a hill and then rolling backwards down the hill into a gas station.",
        "To most Westerners this thing is ready for the junkyard, but to your average Malagasy, it's just a car.",
        "And so as far as cars are concerned, we have an authentic Malagasy experience.",
        "I've learned how to clean the carburetor in the middle of the street.",

        "Maybe it is for that feeling of superiority when I see an expat pulling out in their Land Cruiser.",
