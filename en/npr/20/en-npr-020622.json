        "Obviously I'm going to wait until the hearing's completed before reaching an absolutely final judgment, but I think this is an excellent selection.",
        "Still, Collins had some sharp criticism for the White House, which today had nothing more to say about the NSA program.",
        "The administration needs to be more forthcoming.",

        "Later, he rallied American Christians against the Muslim-dominated north, and constantly he championed the cause of the southern Sudanese.",
        "Although his political base was in south Sudan, Garang talked frequently in recent months about the need for Sudan to address the rumblings of discontent that are emanating from all corners of the country.",
        "In an interview in February of this year with NPR, Garang said that the roots of the current rebel uprising in Darfur are the same ones that pushed the SPLA into its two-decade-long fight with Khartoum.",
