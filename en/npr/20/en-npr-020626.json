        "That's one and specifically, the CBO's estimate assessed that the fees on the industry would indeed be passed through to individuals and employers, and that was their assumption.",
        "In addition, as the Medicaid programs grow, there's a natural cost shifting from a Medicaid reimbursement to physicians to the commercial system for employers and individuals to pay for.",
        "Let me ask you a question that some people are remarking on, and the president has alluded to this.",
        "Cigna's profits rose 7 percent last year.",
        "You had more than $18 billion in revenue; your predecessor left with $110 million retirement package, it sounds like it's a profitable-enough company to absorb some of the fees that'll be added to your business by this bill.",
        "The health-care business - so, for our company or for the industry, but specifically if we stay with Cigna, our health-care businesses had a profit margin of about 2 percent.",
        "And that's been consistent over the last five years.",
        "We've worked with a lot of disclosures with the government.",
        "So it's a thin margin business on an after-tax basis.",
        "A final way of looking at it is, you could take the profits of the entire health-care industry, and that will pay for health care for Americans for about two days.",
        "So the challenge is, what do we do for the other 360-plus days of the year to be able to pay for that?",
        "Mr.",
        "Cordani, when you next report to Cigna's shareholders - or to the board, for that matter - what's the word?",
        "A law has been passed and now, we're going to work with it and it's the future?",
        "Or a disaster has just happened in Washington, it's calamitous for our business?",
        "What's the line here?",
        "We look at our corporation as a global health service company, so we have services outside the U.S.",
        "as well as inside the U.S.",
        "The broad level of services we offer are primarily to employers who are on health improvement, wellness improvement, productivity improvement, etc. So for that focus of our business, we actually see it as having significant opportunity both in the United States as well as outside of the United States.",
        "Would Cigna welcome a trade association that it belongs to, or any other lobby that represents it, to actively work for the repeal of provisions of this act?",
        "I don't believe focusing on repeal right now is in anybody's best interest.",
        "I believe focusing on the next leg of the stool, as rapidly as possible, is critical - which is to drive sustainability to cost.",
        "That's what the focus needs to be on, as opposed to trying to repeal what's already been done and the country spent the year on.",
        "So just to make sure, you're saying doesn't make sense to you to work for repeal right now, but to continue working for cost containment in some way.",
        "Given what the country's just been through to get the bill that was signed into law today, can you imagine another big health-care bill that would address health-care costs actually going through Congress anytime soon?",
        "I guess the question is time.",
        "So, go back and look at the Massachusetts model.",
        "Massachusetts model has been operating for two to three years, and is now at the brink of bankruptcy and has to deal with the cost equation.",
        "So you could view that as an outer limit, as an indication of what will probably transpire at a federal level."

        "So you think around 2013, 2014, we have an appointment with another big health-care bill, is what you're saying.",
        "And ideally - that's correct - and ideally, with some smaller steps along the way so we're not waiting for one, big, fell swoop, but we could actually build upon what has been enacted.",
        "Well, Mr. Cordani, I hope we can check in with you in the coming months as we see what the impact of this health-care law is on the country and on your business.",

        "That's right.",
        "One of the reasons why the government has been slow to act on this crisis is that it says that it fears that images of the army attacking a religious place - a mosque - and also potentially killing young women, students inside the mosque, could spark violence across the country.",
        "You mentioned the warning by Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, earlier.",
        "What role is he playing in this crisis?",
        "He is very much playing behind-the-scenes role.",
        "As I said, he's just made one public comment on the crisis.",

        "And over his eight-year rule, there's been an increase in what's termed as Talibanization in the tribal areas along the Afghan border.",
        "And what's been happening at the Red Mosque here in Islamabad has really brought that problem to the heart of the capital.",
        "So his ability to solve this crisis will be seen as proof of his commitment to the war on terror globally.",
        "Internally, I think President Musharraf has to try and resolve this crisis, and - but he must try and do that in way that has the least amount of bloodshed.",
        "The symbols involved are incredibly sensitive here in Pakistan.",
        "The mosque, of course, is the central symbol of Islam, and the images of death in any storming of the mosque would be politically disastrous for President Musharraf.",
        "So he is trying to avoid that at all cost."

        "The vice president's chief of staff told the press secretary the information was very hush-hush, very much on the QT.",
        "But Fleischer said he did not take that to mean that the information was classified, since Libby did not follow the strict protocol of telling him the information was classified and couldn't be disclosed to others.",
        "And, in fact, within days, Fleischer said he passed the information on to a couple of reporters during a presidential trip to Africa.",
        "By then, he said, the White House was actively pointing the finger at the CIA, blaming the agency for the infamous 16-words in the president's speech about uranium.",
        "Then-National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice told reporters that if the CIA had objected to the words, they would not have been included in the speech.",
        "And to reinforce that message, Fleischer said he mentioned to two reporters that Ambassador Wilson's wife worked for the CIA and that she had sent him on a fact-finding trip, not the vice president.",

        "Have you been patrolling at the Superdome?",
        "Months later, Fleischer told the jury, when he read in the newspapers that the CIA had asked the Justice Department to conduct an investigation of the leak of Valerie Plame Wilson's identity, he was horrified.",
        "He said that he thought to himself, oh, my God, did I play a role in outing a CIA agent?",
