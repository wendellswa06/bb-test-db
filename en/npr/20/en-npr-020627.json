        "Lawyers for defendant Libby may have thought that immunity grant would give them ammunition to discredit Fleischer.",
        "But Libby's lawyer was just as unsuccessful at ruffling Fleischer, as reporters were in the years he deflected their blows in the White House briefing room.",
        "Indeed, Fleischer was a good deal more animated when talking to the jury, as opposed to the press, often smiling and gesturing as he testified.",
        "Fleischer was the fifth witness from the White House, State Department, or CIA to testify about discussions they had with defendant Libby about the wife of Ambassador Wilson and her CIA identity.",
        "All have said their discussions were prior to the date Libby told the grand jury that he learned of her identity.",
        "Fleischer was followed to the witness stand by Vice President Cheney's current chief of staff, David Addington, widely viewed in Washington as, quote, Cheney's Cheney.",
        "Addington to testify that in July of 2003, he met with Libby in a tiny office off the vice president's office in the West Wing of the White House.",
        "Addington had once worked for the CIA and Libby wanted to know whether, if someone had been sent on a trip by his CIA spouse, there would be any paperwork to show that.",
        "Addington testified that there likely would be, since, as he put it, this is the government so there almost always is paperwork.",
        "Addington said that the door to the next office where the vice president's secretary sat was closed.",
        "And at one point, Libby motioned for Addington to keep his voice down.",
        "Today, former New York Times reporter Judith Miller is scheduled to testify.",
        "She went to jail for nearly three months before finally testifying about three conversations that she said she had with Libby about Ambassador Wilson and his wife.",

        "Honeysuckle is a 20 minute drive from the center of the city, and it struck us as a perfectly average place: middle income people, cops, school teachers in mid-sized homes.",
        "It's in a part of the city called New Orleans East, which was undeveloped wetlands until the '60s.",
        "The punishment that Katrina inflicted on Honeysuckle Lane was average: some roof damage, mostly standing water.",
