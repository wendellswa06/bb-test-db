        "The general argument...",
        "So let me get this right.",
        "So people who, you know, if we're talking, and I'm just going to use the vernacular, about people who were acting off, or acting crazy, those are the kind of popular terms for it, the commitment of people who are acting off or seem off goes up, but those people who are actually acting out less than they would be, you know, for the similar group of people committed in different times.",
        "That's right.",
        "And this finding is consistent with a long tradition in research looking at what's called the frustration-aggression theory, which is that when the economy contracts, people become frustrated.",
        "And among the ways that people deal with frustration is that they aggress against others.",
        "There are the famous studies of the relationship between the price of cotton and the lynching of African Americans in the South, for example, at the turn of the century.",
        "When the price of cotton fell, there was more violence toward African Americans and more lynching.",
        "In the contemporary world, thank goodness, we don't lynch people any longer, but it's still the case, for example, that African-American males are coerced into treatment much more frequently when the economy contracts, and they actually are better-functioning males, suggesting that our tolerance for this group of persons actually goes down, and we aggress against them in more societally acceptable ways, in which we report them to the police.",
        "So would it be a situation, for example, where people are afraid by what ordinarily might be normal things?",
        "Like one complaint that neighbors commonly have about each other is noise complaints.",
        "If someone has a party and it gets loud, you might have something like a noise complaint or people also, you know, complain about - you know, for example, in New York City, people have written about if neighbors gather at a street corner to talk, for some groups of neighbors that's just where you talk.",
        "You run into each other, you talk on the street corner.",
        "Other people find that threatening.",
        "What are we really talking about in terms of the behaviors that would trigger this kind of misunderstanding or hostility?",
        "Well, the research focuses on two groups specifically.",
        "Those people who are thought to be threats to others.",
        "That is, you have to exhibit some behavior which suggest that, if you're left untreated, you'll actually do violence to someone else.",
        "So it's not stopping on the street corner to discuss things.",
        "It's threatening other people.",
        "And the second group are those people who are what we call gravely disabled.",
        "And that is that they're not just sort of mumbling, they're actually lying in the street or not able to get up and walk around.",
        "Now, when the economy is good, it turns out that one has to be fairly disabled or quite threatening before he or she gets coerced into treatment.",
        "When the economy gets worse, it appears that people who are less threatening and would not be perceived as being a threat to someone's wellbeing or to their own wellbeing, are perceived as a threat.",
        "So now, whether that's the same kind of intolerance that would account for some people not liking folks having conversations on the street or not, I'm not sure.",
        "I suspect it has more to do with the biological expression of frustration, because this work also is noted in other species that if you frustrate them, they in fact become more aggressive.",
        "So in hard times, we're talking about people taking disagreements, according to the study, to the level where they may have other people committed against their will.",
        "And you talk about the racial implications of that.",
        "What does that say about what might pan out for our society if we're not careful, if there is this - if not racially targeted, at least, racially trackable trend?",
        "Well, the ordinary concern we have about our intolerance of others for reasons that have little to do with their behavior but rather has to do with their race or religion or gender, that concern should be greater when the economy contracts because history suggests we will be less tolerant.",
        "Now, are we making improvements over time?",
        "Sociologists tell us yes, and that we're less likely to do that now than we were earlier.",
        "But we still do it.",
        "And so I think it's a good public health intervention to remind everyone that when the economy gets bad and we start to feel frustration and anger, that we have to be careful how we treat ourselves.",
        "That is, what do we do to make ourselves feel better?",
        "How do we cope with that?",
        "As your earlier guest alluded to, there is an increase in familial violence during these kinds of periods.",
        "There is among job losers, in particular, there is an increase in violence, and there is an increase of alcohol use.",
        "So the general, sort of, set of behaviors that go with coping with anxiety and frustration and, if you will, stress become more problematic.",
        "And it's a good public health intervention, I think and I believe others generally agree, to try to remind the public that this can occur, and we ought to have our best coping strategies in place."
