        "And Turkey, I think, is betting that those interests are going to outweigh any kind of concern about Turkey making alliances with Russia.",

        "It's forcing that sentiment in confrontation with what Congress has done.",
        "And Congress passed a law two years ago saying that, if any country buys or has a significant transaction with Russia's defense sector, that there would be sanctions.",

        "But what I feel most excited about right now is that this movement, which is a movement which is based on theater and based on art, has nearly brought these two forces together in the world.",
        "And just looking at the videos today from India and from Nepal and from Buton and from all over America and the world, everybody has kind of joined these forces together of dance and poetry and song and art installations to really come up with a different kind of energy that can break through this kind of denial and patriarchal wall and prison that we all live in all the time.",
        "And it's so beautiful to see everybody doing it in their own way, in their own community, adapting it to their own culture, to their own language, plus join together in the common One Billion Rising."
