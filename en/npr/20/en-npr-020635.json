        "Well today the Shiite militias in Sadr City who are loyal to the anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr began their day burying their dead.",
        "There were funeral processions throughout Sadr City.",
        "People were walking on foot with wooden coffins strapped to the roofs of cars.",
        "They escorted them to the edge of the district and the police pickup trucks escorted the vans all the way down to the Shiite holy city of Najaf for burial.",

        "I'm standing in front of a football stadium, thousands of evacuees are here.",
        "But people here in general, they're more affluent, they're mobile, they can leave if they want to and go somewhere else; a lot of them are insured.",
        "But what lessons did you specifically draw from Katrina that you are applying here today?",
        "Well, of course a lot of what we've done over the last two and a half years is build on lessons we learned from what happened in New Orleans in 2005.",
        "And that begins with preparation and planning well in advance of events.",
        "We've done a lot of work over the last couple of years with California officials in terms of different kinds of disasters and what we might do.",

        "Everything from over 2,000 firefighters - federal firefighters coming in.",
        "We have about 18 fixed-wing aircraft - larger aircraft that can be used in aerial firefighting as well as a significant number of helicopters with medical assets and medical evacuation capability.",
        "We've moved 75,000 cots down, 50,000 packaged meals and water in case it's necessary for evacuees.",
        "We've got disaster recovery centers being set up today, so that we can begin to process people who need assistance.",
        "So from the firefighting to the rescue to the shelter and ultimately to the recovery, we are fully engaged in Orange County, San Diego and Los Angeles.",
        "Meanwhile, in New Orleans there are still people who haven't gotten back into their homes.",
        "They are still living in temporary conditions.",
        "Is that a possibility here, that years out people will still be in dire situations?",
        "Of course, the scale of the damage here, I hope and I believe, will be substantially less than in New Orleans.",
        "Right now the estimates we have are about 2,100 structures are substantially damaged or destroyed.",
        "That could obviously increase, but it's nothing like the literally tens of thousands of people who were rendered homeless for a long period of time because the flood had decimated an entire city.",
        "Water in some ways is a tougher challenge than fire because it moves much more quickly.",
        "We also envision here that the damage is going to be much more widely dispersed, because we have basically 60 separate fires as opposed to one single, very large catastrophe.",
        "And do you have any prognosis for when this disaster will be over and when people can begin returning to their homes?",
        "Well, Madeleine, right now, yesterday, the day before, and even in today, we were in conditions that are very bad from the standpoint of firefighting because we had a wind that goes from the east to the west of Santa Ana.",
        "It's a hot wind to dry wind.",
        "And it's very favorable, particularly in the drought conditions, to allow fire to develop and spread unpredictably.",
        "The wind is beginning to turn.",
        "The weather prediction is that tomorrow it'll begin to move with much more of a west to east flow coming off the ocean.",
        "Once that happens, it'll increase the amount of humidity, and it will also begin to move the fire away from some of the residential areas.",
        "So that will allow us to do more air missions because that's really been the limiting factor on the air missions.",
        "And that will give us an opportunity to get the upper hand.",
        "But we may be fighting this fire for a couple of days."

        "If you were to craft the bill completely on your own, you've given us some very distinct points that you would like, so I'm not saying that you should reiterate all of them, but maybe, if you were to craft a bill that passed in five minutes from now, what would be the number one thing you would ask for?",

        "I wouldn't have the word encourage, I would say must or shall, rework the mortgages that are held by these investment banks.",

        "They should in essence guarantee or ensure the particular mortgagee, the holder of the mortgage, so that that person can go away whole, the restructured mortgage, and not be victimized.",
        "The decision to bungle mortgages as security was not the decision of the individual homeowner.",
        "That homeowner went to some bank in some town, with the good intentions of achieving the American dream.",
        "It was the mortgage investment - excuse me, investment houses, who found this a golden goose if you will, and decided to buy these up.",

        "And we're coming back from that.",
        "The market needs to calm down, we need to ease the panic, we see some stability going on right now, and we truly need to write a bill that has some of the very important provisions that were already offered, about my friend and colleague, Congressman Waters, who did a fantastic job on the idea of minority participation and community banks, which I support strongly.",
        "And now, add some enforcement provisions that would give a greater authority to the Department of Justice, to other jurisdictional committees like the judiciary committee, House oversight committee to ensure that our consumers, the innocent persons who live on Main Street, I mean our inner cities, the rural communities, are truly protected.",
