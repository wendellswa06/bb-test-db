        "But can you imagine why some politicians now are loath to take this on given what happened to Jimmy Carter in 1980 by Ronald Reagan, given the fact that this speech is often derided as a low mark in his presidency and something that maybe have cost him reelection.",
        "Well, I've never frankly, I've never heard anybody say it may have caused him reelection.",
        "Well one of the factors, one of the factors.",
        "Generally speaking, if in the end you win the next election no matter what you did or didn't do up to that point you're considered a genius.",
        "If you lose the next election, then nobody wants to be associated with you or just about anything that you did or stood for.",
        "And if anything I think Democrats are in some ways more guilty of that than even Republicans are.",
        "So if you were advising Barack Obama or John McCain right now to make this kind of speech and to urge Americans to conserve - a conservation speech, what would you, as a former press secretary, what would you say would be the best way to communicate that?",
        "I wouldn't advise either one of them just to make just a conservation speech.",
        "I would urge both of them to be very honest about the fact that there may not be in the short term, it may be more sacrifice than benefit but for our long term good and the long term benefit of our children and grandchildren this is what needs to be done.",
        "I think Americans will respond to that.",

        "Thank you.",

        "Before we talk about that specifically, back up and give us a little context for these kinds of protests around content and image in the past.",
        "Well, you know, certainly, since hip-hop culture has been visible in the mainstream, you know, the last 15 or 20 years, there have been a number of instances where people have objected to language, images, the nature of the culture itself.",
        "You know, in the '90s, C.",

        "And…",

        "But there's nothing new about it.",
        "Todd, there also have been protests that effectively changed law, I'm thinking of the PMRC, the Parents Music Resource Center, Tipper Gore and some of her associates actually changing the labeling laws basically around explicit lyrics.",
        "This is something different.",
        "This is an attempt to really speak to the executives and try to get them to change voluntarily.",
        "Do those kind of protests generally work?",
        "Well, I mean, you know, we're talking about these protests this morning on the national airwaves, so people are paying attention.",

        "I think it depends on the instance and the context.",
        "I don't see that this will work.",
        "I mean, their complaints are very, very, very subjective.",
        "When you talk about words, like decency and responsibility and positive and negative, these are very subjective terms and they change from person to person.",

        "And there's a certain arrogance there, a certain, you know, lack of being connected with what's going on in the real world that I think is fueling them.",
        "But ultimately, you know, the way to go about this is not by violating someone's privacy and trespassing and protesting in front of their home.",
