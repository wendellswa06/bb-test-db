        "So we do think that the legal challenges are a nuisance and designed to delay and obstruct the process.",
        "But we believe that this project will get into construction by the end of the year, and we will be generating clean electricity for the Cape and islands and hopefully inspiring other Atlantic coastal states to look at tapping their offshore wind resources, also.",
        "Can you make it cheap enough to be competitive?",
        "Well, let's put it this way, Ira: Offshore wind is a bargain when you consider the external costs of burning fossil fuels and generating electricity with nuclear power."
