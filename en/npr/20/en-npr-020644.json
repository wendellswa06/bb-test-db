        "First of all, if President Trump had come to Congress first, as incidentally he said President Obama should have done in 2013, would you have supported these strikes?",
        "Likely, Michel, I would have.",
        "There has to be a consequence for using chemical weapons against civilians, and that's why when President Obama came to Congress in 2014 as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I did vote for military action.",
        "But what President Obama did was he followed the constitutional requirement that you can't start a war without a Congress, and by coming to Congress, he laid out a strategy.",

        "It's a means to an end.",
        "You have to understand the strategy to know whether it makes sense.",
        "So my criticism of President Trump is he's ignoring the legal requirement, and he hasn't given us a strategy for our activities in Syria which makes military action potentially very reckless.",
        "There are those in both political parties though who believe that President Obama's decision not to take more aggressive action back in 2013 is what laid the groundwork for these subsequent actions by Syria in hindsight, and I know that's 2013.",

        "Well, you know, the Cape Wind became a high-profile project, and we'd like to think that we've inspired other coastal states to look at their offshore wind resources as evidenced by, you know, the proposals that are coming up and down the Atlantic Coast and Gulf Coast.",

        "The reason that offshore wind is more attractive than even land-based wind farms is that we produce electricity coincident with the peak demand.",
        "So when folks really need the electricity, in the hottest summer days, in the coldest winter nights, the offshore wind farms will be producing electricity.",
        "And this is backed up by over seven years of data that we've collected through our offshore wind data tower.",
        "And we've correlated it to the 10 historic peak electric days in the New England region.",
        "So, you know, Ira, 28 coastal states consume over 73 percent of this nation's electricity because that's where the population centers are and the big electric demand growth is.",
        "So by tapping an offshore wind resource right next to the load, you've really got distributed generation that's going to create a more secure, safer and cleaner energy future.",
        "You know, people are concerned about bird deaths, bat deaths.",
        "Yet environmentalists have been backing your project down the line, haven't they?",
        "The major national and regional and local environmental organizations have backed this project, including Mass Audubon Society that did parallel research to the research that was done by the federal government under this exhaustive and comprehensive permitting process.",
        "And, you know, Ira, the greatest threat to birds and marine life is climate change.",
        "And Cape Wind is designed to help mitigate climate change by offsetting almost a million tons of greenhouse gases annually.",
        "What was the major engineering challenge that you faced in this project?",
        "The major - you know, the major challenge was definitely the permitting of the project because, you know, this is the first offshore wind project, and, in effect, Cape Wind has helped evolve the regulatory framework for offshore wind in America.",
        "The good thing about Cape Wind is that the technical siting criteria, it's in shallow water, it has a low wave regime.",
        "So that's similar to the earliest offshore wind farms that have been developed and built in Europe."

        "That's right.",

        "Exactly, and we've cross-pollinated a lot of information from Europe.",
        "We've traveled to Europe and seen a lot of offshore wind farms and talked with policymakers over there, engineers.",

        "Although we have many turbine, wind turbine manufacturers in the United States building land-based wind turbines, as the offshore wind industry progresses in the United States and there are more projects, there will be a supply chain that will develop in the United States to build large, offshore wind turbines just as they're doing in Denmark and Germany and in the United Kingdom.",
