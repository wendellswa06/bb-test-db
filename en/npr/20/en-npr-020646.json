        "Does this count as progress in a year where we have spent a lot more time talking about trade wars than trade deals?",
        "Well, look; I think President Trump made a decision to sort of pull back from the brink and to declare victory with the reincarnated NAFTA, whatever you want to call it.",
        "Most experts - and I'm not one - on this subject do believe that it essentially is a reincarnated NAFTA, that it builds on the foundation substantially of the original one.",
        "And by the way, it's not a done deal.",
        "I should point out that there's going to be a real political fight I think up here in Washington on Captain Hill over approving this.",

        "That's right.",
        "And I feel like you saw the lasting hard feelings as a result of these very tough negotiations with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who did appear at the last minute was uncertain at the signing ceremony today in Buenos Aires but had some, you know, strong words for President Trump.",
        "And again, you've had this amazing spectacle.",
        "What have we taken to get here of the United States going after Canada, one of its closest allies?",
        "David, your takeaway so far from the G-20.",

        "There's been a lot of attention paid, as we heard, to whether President Trump and Vladimir Putin were going to sit down together on the sidelines of this summit, a meeting over which, had it happened, if it may happen in some form, Robert Mueller would have cast a very long shadow.",
        "I want to ask each of you, how have this week's developments - and as usual, there have been a lot - how have they advanced our understanding of the big picture, the relationship between Trump and Russia, David?",

        "And so there's, like, the Julian Assange angle, the Manafort angle, this Trump Tower in Moscow angle.",
        "And so every week, there's another efflorescence of some new little bit of a big, sprawling and centralist scandal.",
        "And so the first thing we know is that it's swallowing up the Trump administration and how we talk about it.",
        "The second thing we're learning, especially from the Michael Cohen deal, this - is that Trump was not far removed from all this stuff.",
        "There were all these machinations going on, and Trump seems to have been more closely involved in a lot of them than we knew."

        "Susan.",
        "Well, I'm not inured to corruption.",
        "No, in fact, actually what I was going to say, David, is that I've found this week to be not just another week in the Mueller investigation.",
        "But at least for me, it's taken a while to absorb I think the scale of what I think the news was but in particular the Cohen indictment, which is a charge of lying to Congress, but in this pleadings that are agreed to with Trump's former attorney and fixer.",
