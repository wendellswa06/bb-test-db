        "It is the responsibility of the president to articulate a new plan for Iraq that makes it clear to the Iraqis that they must defend their own streets and their own security, a plan that makes - promotes stability in the region, and a plan that allows us to responsibly redeploy our troops.",

        "The Works Progress Administration, the so-called WPA, the Civilian Conservation Corps, put hundreds of thousands into the millions of people back to work, and that seemed to mute crime increases, and that has obvious implications for the incoming Obama administration's proposed stimulus package.",

        "Neighborhoods change in a number of ways.",
        "An obvious way is that if people lose their homes, home-vacancy rates go up and vacant homes often are a signal to would-be criminals that that may be a place in which one can get away with activity more than in other places.",
        "When storefronts go vacant, the same signal is sent.",
        "And so, neighborhoods, especially neighborhoods already economically marginal, are very vulnerable during economic downturns."
