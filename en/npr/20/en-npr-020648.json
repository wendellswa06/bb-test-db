        "I remember that when Mayor Giuliani was in office in New York, there was a lot of talk about the broken-windows theory, which is, you know, what you were talking about, that if you've got a couple of broken windows, people know that you've got a neighborhood that's not being taken care of.",
        "Has that stood up to the test of scrutiny, in terms of a theory for how things develop that really - it pay - you know, does it make sense, for example, for communities to band together to try to deal with things like broken windows simply as a way of preserving overall property rates?",
        "Partially by remembering everything, putting the whole story of a person's life and also because this way, there is a work of art that will go on forever.",
        "And so in one way, Colin will now live forever.",
        "Well, I think that there's a lot of problems with what happened in Syria.",
        "I think what we should've done in February of 2014 was to act pursuant to a U.N.",
        "Security Council resolution that passed to establish a humanitarian zone in northern Syria and tell people if they wanted to come there to flee Assad, ISIS, cholera, poverty, hunger, we would protect them.",
        "I think we should have done that, and the U.S.",
        "and the world will look back and feel that that was a real just horrible tragedy that we didn't.",
        "But the Constitution doesn't allow shortcuts.",
        "The reason that you're not supposed to start a war without Congress was a moral judgment by the framers that if we're going to order our troops to risk their lives and potentially kill others, it should be based on a determination that the mission was in the national interest, and the way you get that determination is by having a debate and a vote.",
        "And as you pointed out, Donald Trump as a citizen in 2014 took to the airwaves to rail against President Obama and say you can't do this without a vote of Congress.",
        "I'm very worried that he now feels like he can just act on his own.",
        "And as I expressed in my own social media last night, If he thinks he can do this bombing without Congress, what's to stop him if he decides he wants to bomb other countries?",
        "I'm asking for an opinion now.",
        "I'm asking you to assess the views of your colleagues, which may or may not be comfortable for you.",
        "But we've heard from a few of your colleagues but not that many, frankly.",
        "If they are really disturbed at not being consulted, don't you think we would have heard from more of them?",
        "Really it begs the question is has this become a partisan question?",
        "Michel, actually, you know, I don't think it's that partisan.",
        "Sadly, it's kind of nonpartisan.",
        "Congress likes to duck war votes.",
        "Congress wants to advocate the responsibility.",
        "This was a power that was handed to Congress in Article 1, probably the most jealously guarded power that Congress should have, is not letting a president start a war without them.",
        "But what congresses of both parties - and by both parties I mean first Whigs and Federalists.",
        "And now Democrats and Republicans have kind of figured out is, a war vote is tough.",
        "It's a very, very tough vote under any circumstance.",
        "And so if you can duck it - and if the president does it and it doesn't work out, you can criticize him.",
        "If it works out well, you can say, that's great.",
        "But I represent a state that's very connected to the military.",
        "I have a child in the military.",
        "I've really looked at why we do it the way we - why we're supposed to do it this way.",
        "And it's because we're not supposed to commit our troops and force them to risk their lives, their health, the health of their colleagues unless Congress is courageous enough to say this mission's in the national interest, and there just shouldn't be any shortcuts.",
        "And President Trump seemed to understand that just three or four years ago.",
        "But his decision to now act without even coming to Congress, I think really, really puts us on a slippery slope that we're going to regret.",
        "That is United States Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia.",
        "Senator, thank you so much for speaking with us.",
        "Absolutely, Michel."

        "It's hard to imagine two weeks like that in a row, but we're going to give NPR senior Washington editor Ron Elving a chance to try.",
        "Hi, Ron.",

        "There will be some developments in some of those stories.",
        "We'll be looking for more from the Jackson case, of course.",
        "And many will be waiting to see if Governor Sanford resigns down in South Carolina.",
        "Here in Washington on another front, we expect to see a CIA release a five-year-old report on the treatment and interrogation of terror suspects.",
        "This is a report that a federal judge has ordered the agency to release, and the CIA has been struggling for some time now to decide how much of the report by their own internal inspector general can remain classified and how much must be made public at this point.",
        "We'll be watching for that.",
        "One thing we do know is that Congress will not pass any more big bills because they will be gone next week for their Fourth of July recess.",
        "And President Obama is also expecting a quiet week with very few public events as he prepares for his next overseas trip to Russia, Italy and Ghana.",
        "Talk about the last act in the House before they closed down for the holiday.",
        "The energy bill the House passed late Friday while most of the world was distracted.",
        "What do you make of this?",
        "It plays as a big win for the White House, I think, but it's really not the president's bill, nor is it Al Gore's bill or that preferred by the greener members of Congress.",
        "There were too many compromises in it to call it that, but it is the first effort by Congress to do anything about global warming or, really, to shift the country seriously from the fossil fuels that we've been depending on for the last century, to renewables and nuclear power and greater energy efficiency, essentially the sources we think we'll rely on in the next century.",
        "And we're going to have to start over, you know, with this bill in the Senate in the fall, and they'll pass something very different.",
        "And then the big question will be what kind of a role the White House can play in reconciling the House and Senate bills.",
        "But I do think it's fair to say this is another hinge of history, another major shift of direction on a fundamental national policy issue."

        "We definitely want to work to improve people's - what we remember from elementary school education and beyond.",
        "But the book is more about the need for the public to be more engaged in science issues, because it's critical to meeting a lot of the challenges of the 21st century, and that's climate change, that's hurricanes like we were just hearing about, that's human health and so many more issues, when instead it's often sort of relegated to this special interest status in policy discussions and elsewhere.",

        "But instead, we kind of turned that upside down and looked at it from a 2008, 2009 and beyond perspective and looked at why this divide exists between American culture and science and the different ways that that gap is widening.",
        "And we focus in the book on four particular points, and that's: science in the media; how scientists and science is portrayed in Hollywood; science and religion and the perceived conflicts, when it matters, when it doesn't; and finally, of course, science and politics, which is really an extension in many ways of Chris' first book, which is called \"\"The Republican War on Science.\"\" But looking at the big picture, especially now with the change in administration and then ultimately moving on to what some of the solutions are and how we can do a little better.",
        "Can social media, this - these new kinds of ways that people are talking to one another, like blogging or twittering and things like that, can they help reach a broader audience?",
        "Will they help in, you know, in people talking about science?",
        "Well, they can certainly help, and I love that so many forms of new media are being utilized by the science community, and that's in the name, science blogging.",

        "And they were funny, and they were engaging, and they were talking about something that's going to impact all of us and all of our children and beyond.",
