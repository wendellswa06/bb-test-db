        "At a border crossing outside El Paso, Texas, today, hundreds of people gathered to begin a march toward the town of Tornillo, where there's a tent encampment to house migrant children separated from their parents under the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy toward people trying to cross the border into the U.S.",
        "Reporter Monica Ortiz Uribe is covering that march, and she's with us now from Tornillo.",
        "Monica, welcome.",
        "Thanks so much for joining us.",
        "Hi, Michel.",
        "Happy to be here.",

        "How many people are there?",

        "side, and they were not far from the spot where the federal government has set up this temporary children's shelter.",
        "And there were lots of families out.",
        "I saw dads carrying sons on their shoulders, parents pulling their toddlers in wagons, and I saw also a young boy with a sign that said keep families together.",
        "One of the protesters that I spoke to was Marco Covarrubias (ph), and he held his 3-year-old daughter in his arms while she waved an American flag.",
        "I felt morally I had to be here.",
        "Before I'm an American or anything else, I'm a dad, and I just couldn't imagine anyone, let alone the federal government, separating me from my daughter when all I want is just, you know, a better shot at life, so...",
        "So Marco was born in Mexico, but his mom, who's an American, helped him get his U.S.",
        "citizenship.",
        "Now he studies political science at the community college in El Paso, and he feels his situation here is sheer luck, that he could've easily been like one of the families detained at the border.",
        "And he said he felt it was important to bring his daughter to the protest to show her how to care about others beyond their own family."

        "I understand that there are members of Congress there as well.",
        "Yes, the protest was organized in part by the office of U.S.",
        "Congressman Beto O'Rourke, who is challenging Ted Cruz for his seat on the Senate.",
        "O'Rourke is a native of El Paso, and he's long sought to change the rhetoric about the U.S.-Mexico border.",
        "He paints the border as a welcoming place with a low crime rate and a rich cultural history.",
        "And O'Rourke was out under the harsh sun today, sweating through his dress shirt.",

        "BETO O'ROURKE: There is an open question about who we are as Americans, whether we are a country that would continue to do this.",
        "Two thousand times so far in the last 45 days, kids have been taken from their moms, from their dads, detained at places just like this tent city here in Tornillo.",
        "There was another congressman, Joe Kennedy from Massachusetts, who also flew down to be at the protest.",
        "And he's the grandson of former Senator Robert Kennedy who's famous for his support of the Latino community.",
        "You know, it's interesting.",
        "There was another protest there - a group of Democratic lawmakers paid a quote, unquote, \"\"surprise visit\"\" to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in New Jersey also today.",
        "But why this particular one in El Paso?",
        "Well, El Paso is a city of immigrants - not just from Mexico and Latin America.",
        "I mean, there were Chinese immigrants and African-Americans who helped build the railroad back in the late 1800's.",
        "There are people of Middle Eastern descent.",
        "And El Paso has a reputation for being an affordable, family-friendly city.",
        "Many young professionals are moving back here to start a family.",
        "So for them, the zero-tolerance policy both literally and figuratively hits close to home.",
        "What can you tell us about the camp where the tent city is - it's being called?",
        "What do we know about what the conditions are like there?",
        "Congressman Will Hurd, who represents this district, visited the facility yesterday.",
        "He told Texas Monthly that the facility consists of air-conditioned tents that house mostly teenaged boys at the moment.",
        "They get three meals a day.",
        "There's a medical clinic and access to legal consultation.",
        "O'Rourke told reporters today that there are currently 200 kids in the facility and that there are plans to expand its capacity to 4,000."

        "So before we let you go, Monica, what is it that the marchers say they want?",
        "Well, O'Rourke was asked that question today by reporters, and he mentioned that he'll be supporting a bill that's set to go before the House next week that includes language that would prohibit the separation of parents and kids at the U.S.-Mexico border.",
        "And this is part of two larger immigration bills that are set to go before the House next week.",

        "Monica, thanks so much for speaking with us.",
        "You're very welcome.",
        "And that incurs a delay in note-taking that fully sighted students have to deal with, and in a fast-paced classroom, that's going to accumulate to the point where the low-vision student is not going to be able to keep up in taking notes.",
        "And so we developed a device - when I was I was having some of these problems in keeping up in note-taking after I started a math major in 2007 and had to withdraw from some classes, and I found that the existing assistive technologies, they either fall into that category of having that board/no-board delay I just described, or they require classroom infrastructure or support personnel that you are relying on to make them effective.",
        "So there's smart boards, which, you know, you can install in the classroom.",
        "The professor writes on them and they can stream the content.",
        "Or you have camera-based installations that are meant for archiving lecture content.",
        "But similarly, they could stream video to a student's laptop if you had the proper setup.",
        "But you know, when we were looking at assistive technology solutions, I felt that you can't always assume that you're going to have an installation like that available.",
        "So I mean, maybe your university has the money and the will to set this up, but what happens when you go to a conference, or when you go to...",
        "So you have a portable device that looks like it's about the size of a milk carton with a camera on it, and you can adjust where the camera looks, and then you plug it into your laptop?",
        "That's correct.",
        "So what we did is we set up - we figured out that for low-vision students to take notes in class, they need to be able to take handwritten notes if they can, since that's important for science, technology, engineering and math classes.",
        "And they need it to be portable so they're not relying on other people."

        "And similarly, they need to be able to view the board and their notes without a contact(ph) switching between the two, a large delay in contact(ph) switching.",
        "And so what we did is we built a - and by we I mean myself and the Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing, so this was a research lab I was volunteering programming time at in 2007, and about the same time I was having trouble in classes.",
        "And I realized that, you know, I have my own research problem on my hands.",
        "So yeah, what we developed is, we put a tablet PC on the desk.",
        "So that's a Windows computer that sits flat on the desk.",
        "And it can take the multi-touch input like the modern-day tablets, but also, and importantly, it can take pen(ph) inputs so that you can have sub-pixel-accurate inking so that you can write, you know, fine detailed equations and diagrams.",
        "Attached to this tablet PC is a custom-designed pan-tilt zoom camera.",
        "So that's a camera that provides a live view of the board, but with that live view, we need to zoom in, and once we're zoomed in, we need to be able to reposition where the camera is aiming.",
        "So to do that, we put some servo-motors underneath the camera.",
        "So you can pan it left and right and tilt it up and down.",
        "So you can point at arbitrary spots on the board.",
        "And then on the tablet PC, we put a split-screen interface.",
        "On half of the screen you've got a digital notepad for taking handwritten or typed notes, and in the other half you have live video of the board.",
        "And to control where the camera is zoomed in or where it's pointing, you have just your basic controls so that you can just tap any point on the image and it'll center on that, or you can drag any feature in the image, and whatever feature starts under your finger will remain under your finger as the camera as the camera is panning and tilting.",
        "We actually have a video on our website at sciencefriday.com, a video you provided us of how this all works.",
        "And so it solves the problem for people with low-vision problems like yourself.",
        "Will it be available anytime soon for people to buy it?",
        "We're hoping so.",
        "So we've gone through three generations of prototypes, and the this generation isn't quite ready for commercial production, but we're working toward - so the third generation, we used 3-D printing, stereo lithography, for printing the shell(ph), and we have a bunch of industrial components that we combine inside.",
        "And it's a little bit larger and noisier and more expensive than we'd like to have in a product that we'd bring out to the market, but in a fourth generation design, what we'd do is move to - we'd construct an injection mold, and we would compress a number of the industrial components into it."

        "Do you have a company interested in making this for you?",
        "We're actually, right now we're talking about spinning off a company.",
        "So the two options, of course, are spinning off a company or licensing it to one of the assistive technology vendors.",
        "So we are in discussions right now about spinning off a company.",
        "Might you have an iPad version or something for these new devices that are coming out?",

        "You have a video magnifier, and then you can just take your own notes on a notepad.",
        "But one of the nice things that we do with the Note-Taker is we have the video and the audio being recorded on the device, the tablet PC.",
        "So we know what time everything's happening in the class.",
