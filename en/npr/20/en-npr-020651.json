        "And so, you know, if you want to look through your notes, you might find that there's a place where you weren't keeping up on the note-taking as well.",

        "I mean, there's about 19 million low-vision adults in the U.S., and you know, fewer than 40 percent of them are participating in the workforce.",

        "But we think that our solution solves a real problem.",

        "And then we're talking about either - you know, there's kind of two paths we can go.",
        "It's either continue doing the academic research with the user studies.",
        "We've got a half-dozen low-vision students using it right now and engaging about 50 more as we speak.",
        "So the one path, there's - on the one path there's the academia, staying in academia for a little bit, letting the technology incubate a little longer, or spinning off that company.",
        "So these are the questions we're asking ourselves right now.",
        "Let me give you one last high-tech question, coming in from Second Life: Why not use a high-res camera and digital pan instead of servo-motors?",
        "I think both of our listeners who understand that question - yeah, go ahead.",
        "Sure, so you can do that to some extent.",
        "Like, fully sighted students, I've seen some students using 720p or 1080p cameras in the classroom, and they'll record them, and once you review them later, they are able to see the material on the board.",
        "But low-vision students have the unique need that they need lots of magnification.",
        "So a typical optical magnifier is going to provide them, let's say, 12x zoom.",
        "And so if you look at, say, a 1080p webcam, which is, you know, 1920 by 1080 pixels, if you start zooming in 10x zoom, you're not going to have enough resolution to read the material as well as if you had, say, a 36x zoom lens like our camera has.",
        "So you have 36 power on that?",
        "Wow.",
        "Yes.",
        "So I mean like in Seattle recently, at the Imagine Cup, we were on the 20th floor reading license plates."
