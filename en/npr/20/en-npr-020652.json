        "But this is where things get kind of fuzzy because President Obama never banned cops from getting ballistic helmets, or boats or even most kinds of guns.",
        "The ban applied only to a few items such as grenade launchers and armored vehicles with tank treads.",
        "For the rest of the military gear, the police just had to show a need and abide by a few rules in how they used it.",

        "Yeah, so I mean, there is a kind of political orthodoxy that military equipment is universally bad, and it makes for more aggressive policing and that - on the political left.",
        "And on the political right, we should give law enforcement whatever tools they need to keep themselves safe.",
        "And I think sometimes that political orthodoxy misses the point a bit.",

        "I do know that the more militarized law enforcement become, the greater the concern they'll be used as an occupying force, and the greater a message is being sent from the people who are most concerned about how law enforcement is being used in their community.",
        "For many reformers, the phrase police militarization is more about mindset, especially a certain gung-ho attitude that sometimes seems to accompany the gear.",

        "Well, we are looking at it from the business standpoint, but we also are criminologists at the University of Florida as well.",
        "But so, we look at macro and micro components of what is happening, and you know, anecdotally, the retailers that we work with - and we are working with quite a few of the larger, well-known chains - they're seeing upticks in the amount of people they are catching shoplifting, the amount of people they are catching, you know, their employees who are stealing.",
        "But we've just conducted an experiment that took place from May until November of '08, and we've just compiled the data, and it was interesting because during the experiment - and this is 80 stores in Chicago, Atlanta, and Jacksonville, Florida, where we were studying the effects of certain countermeasures that the retailers use on loss in sales of Mach3 and other premium blades.",
        "And what we saw was that sales were ticking down continuing throughout the experimental time and that losses were ticking upward.",
        "So, we now have some empirical evidence that during that time period, as the economy overall was weakening, that their sales were weakening, and of course, their losses were going up.",

        "I'm going to turn back to you for a second, Richard.",
        "When you hear about the rise in theft at stores, how does that also affect people?",
        "I mean, some people really do say - and we were hoping to hear from someone who has gone in and committed some shoplifting herself - some people say, look, this is just what I have to do to survive.",
        "How does that sense of desperation affect the nature of a community and the sort of standards for how people view ethical behavior?",
        "Well, I think, you know, I think your other guest has an important notion.",
        "To the degree that people believe other people are desperate and prepared to engage in behavior they wouldn't under normal circumstances and they're getting away with it, that can generate additional crime.",
        "But I should say, we should be a little bit careful about how we think about an economic downturn influencing people's behavior.",
        "It's not simply that people - someone who loses a job immediately becomes a shoplifter.",
        "I don't think - that may happen, but I don't think it's quite that simple.",
        "I think what happens, by and large, is that as the economy turns down, people, as the economists call it, begin to trade down.",
        "They begin to shop in somewhat less expensive retail outlets.",
        "So, the people who went to Sears now go to Wal-Mart.",
        "The people who may have shopped in Wal-Mart are now more likely to shop in the thrift stores run by the Goodwill and Salvation Army or the pawnshops.",
        "And we have evidence that thrift - Goodwill and Salvation Army thrift stores and, for that matter, Wal-Mart, sales have not plummeted like those of other retail outlets.",
        "But then one asks, where do the people who shopped at Wal-Mart or shopped at the thrift stores go?",
        "And some of them will go into the so-called street markets, where knock-off goods are available and stolen goods are available.",
        "And as the demand for stolen goods rises, the incentives for property criminals strengthen and we get more property crime.",
        "So, it's not simply that desperate people become thieves; it's also that people at the economic margin are more willing to entertain the idea of purchasing stolen goods, and that provides incentives for street criminals.",
