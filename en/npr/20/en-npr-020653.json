        "Well, we term it organized retail crime, and I would agree, really, with this broad statement, and we do see that now people are more willing to hit the Internet, flea markets and other sources of - and we call it, SCAG, which is stolen counterfeit and altered goods, because of that economic effects.",
        "We do see that some of the rationalizations are made easier as well, and risk seems to get it down.",
        "There are fewer employees in the stores, and the employees that are there may or may not be as a motivated as they were before.",
        "But what can you do about organized retail crime?",
        "The retailers right now have organized ORC teams that are trying to look for patterns and attack some of the larger networks.",
        "They're trying to work with manufacturers and with the wholesalers to try and at least shut down and make it more difficult to move goods that are counterfeit or altered or stolen to the market or be more discriminating.",
        "The problem, of course, is the retailers themselves buy, as they call it, off the wire, and they buy goods that are sometimes of unknown origin not purposefully.",
        "So, it's large problem that has to be attacked by working with the manufacturers, the wholesalers and the retailers, but then also targeting the active boosters and fencers that are in the local market.",
        "So, those things are happening; it's just very, very difficult to track and it's pretty much all demand-driven.",
        "And right now, the demand's there, but does tend to grow, I would agree, during these economic times.",
        "And when it comes to taking merchandise, do you think that employees are as likely to take the merchandise as customers?",
        "There have been some spectacular cases, where people have basically opened up the stores that they work in and even let their friends come in and shop for free.",
        "So, how do employers respectfully deal with their employees and yet, at the same time, keep an eye on the merchandise?",
        "Well, a lot of it's about the culture, not just the company culture, but really, most importantly, the culture of each location.",
        "And so, you know, what the retailer is trying to do there in this case is do a little bit better job of pre-employment screening, find those that are maybe more likely to steal than others, because they may set limits; their ethics are a little more transitory than others; they're situational, in fact.",
        "But then trying to set the culture, you treat people right; you give them the sense of empowerment and some optimism about the future.",
        "But they also have controls, who has access to certain areas or merchandise or passwords or codes or the cash.",
        "And then also, make it a little riskier, that they have hotlines where employees can report dishonesty in confidential way; they have other controls that they can put in there, electronics, obviously, closed-circuit television.",
        "If people are stealing from cash registers or not ringing the full price, under-ringing or sweetheart-ing merchandise out, that those can be tracked and traced through electronic means.",
        "So, there's sort of a series of things that you prevent and detect.",
        "I want to ask about rave in the context of what we're talking about, and I want to ask each of you this question, starting with you, Richard.",
        "When you have a situation when, in many lower-income communities, which are not synonymous with black communities, but there are plenty of black, lower-income communities, you walk in; there is Plexiglas everywhere; the whole shopping experience has become very walled-off and very - the whole idea of risk and crime is literally in front of your face.",
        "How does that affect - particularly if there's differences in the race between the vendor and the clientele, do we have any sense that that causes hostility in the end?",
        "I'm not saying that it's something people shouldn't do, putting up Plexiglas, but one thing, one conversation I've had with people is that they feel demeaned by some of the prevention methods to that are used.",
        "How does play out, Richard?",
        "I think it may cause hostility and tension in some instances, but you know, I think we have to put that in the broader context of historical tension in low-income, especially minority communities between persons who - customers and retailers, if they're of different groups.",
        "You know, absent Plexiglas, one still gets some tension between - and group-related tension between merchants and customers in low-income communities.",
        "But I suspect, in some instances, that tension is heightened when customers are faced with a walled-off, garrison-like retail establishment.",
        "Read, do you ever discuss that kind of an issue as you guys look at the research you're doing?"

        "We do, and most of our research now, particularly last three years, has been a little more holistic.",
        "We're there, because of who we're working with, to understand the dynamics from the offender standpoint.",
        "We conduct ongoing interviews with shoplifters and fences and other offenders.",
        "With customers, we do consumer intercepts in stores, after a point of sale and so on, and we talked to employees and so forth and trying collect that systematic evidence about what's going on.",
        "We also study CCTV footage to look at dynamics in locations or outside stores.",
        "But this does come up, but it comes up with, let's say, minority-owned or operated locations, too, where you might see the garrison effect and so on.",
        "It's not exclusive to any particular side, but it can create that problem.",
        "What we find now is that, you know, people, sort of, are starting to expect and understand that the retailer does need to protect their merchandise.",
        "They have to make some kind of profit to stay business and to operate in those locations where they are maybe more disadvantaged.",
        "And so, they may have to take some higher steps.",
        "And so, yes, it comes up constantly, and I think that it's a series issue.",
