        "Many times, people told us, I was just on a street corner - and maybe in the wrong place at the wrong time - and they ended up there.",
        "And as a result - for that reason, I definitely felt sorry for some of them.",
        "I felt sorry for a young man that I write about whose name was Sammy(ph), who was a 15-year-old, who ended up at our prison, only to be sent back out because they realized he was innocent.",
        "And while he was being sent out, he was on a bus and an IED hit that bus.",
        "So he was innocent.",

        "And very quickly, that became very demoralizing.",
        "I think we went through all the different feelings of disbelief and guilt and anger.",

        "And how did your attitude changed during this whole time?",
        "Thanks, Angel.",
        "Lt.",

        "GERMAIN: Thank you.",
        "I do think that - at first, when they came in, when the prisoners came in or the detainees came in and we started to providing care, they were very fearful, sometimes, or wondering what are we going to do with them.",
        "And I think as they saw - they came back from surgery, for example, and their wounds were healing, we were looking happy that they were getting better, I think there was a good sharing back and forth that they realized that we were really intent on doing a good job in trying to keep them alive and well.",
        "And I felt, for the most part, nothing but general respect from the patients that I took care of there."

        "Six months later, give us some idea of how much damage the fire did and especially to the animals who live there.",
        "Yeah, so one thing about the Woolsey Fire that was really impressive was just the sheer size of it - three times larger than the biggest fire to affect the Santa Monicas ever before.",
        "And it burned over 40% of the natural area within the Santa Monica Mountains.",
        "So it really - it really had a huge effect, and we're continuing to see those effects even six months later.",
        "For example, we've been following mountain lions in the park for 17 years or so, and we're continuing to see they - as soon as the fire occurred, we saw them stay largely out of that area.",
        "They would pass through it still once in a while, but, even six months later, they are mostly not using it.",
        "What - what has happened to the woodrats?",
        "One of the groups of animals that get especially affected by the fire itself is the smaller animals, so small mammals and rabbits and rodents.",
        "And one species that we think gets especially affected is woodrats because they build these 5 to 6 foot tall houses made out of sticks, which are amazing structures, and they live in them literally for generations.",
        "But the problem is their strategy when they're threatened is to run to their house.",
        "And it's a big house made of sticks.",
        "And so, of course, when the fire comes through, they really get hammered.",
        "Not only do we think there's really bad mortality for animals, especially woodrats, but then it's very hard for them to recover because all the vegetation is gone.",
        "Their houses are gone, and then it's hard to rebuild them.",
        "And that's an animal that's very important prey for coyotes, for bobcats.",
        "They also do a lot of seed dispersal.",
        "So we think they're an important part of the system that is really majorly affected.",
        "Did I hear that you found some bobcat kittens recently?",
        "We did actually.",
        "Yeah, so it was one of these bobcats who, apparently, completely had to move her home range from a totally burned area to a less burned area.",
        "She had a litter of four kittens that we were able to document.",
        "It was interesting, actually, because it was in a backyard, so we had to contact the people and make sure they were OK with us going in there and counting the kittens and marking them.",
        "But it was - that was good news that even in the face of this disaster we had that reproduction.",
        "And, of course, bobcat kittens are entertaining and cute.",
        "How's the recovery going?",
        "One thing that's been positive is we had a huge rain year this year, and that has definitely helped.",
        "And I'm not as much of an expert on the vegetation, but our native vegetation is coming back.",
        "We've had amazing flowers.",
        "And one thing that's definitely helped in some of our stream systems - the streams get often completely filled in with debris and amphibians, like newts or threatened red-legged frogs, that we're trying to reintroduce to the park.",
        "They're breeding habitat gets completely lost.",
        "But with all the rains that we've had, that has helped wash out some of that debris flow.",
        "So I think one issue is the massive size of this fire.",
        "So we're actually starting a project where we're going to use remote cameras throughout the fire area to see how long does it take different species to come back and make it into the burned areas.",
