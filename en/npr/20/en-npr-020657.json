        "Well, it's a very significant distinction under international law.",
        "There are other treaties that cover incendiary weapons, for example, or that cover bullets, so it's important to have very precise definitions in treaties for that reason.",

        "My question is that I've seen so many internationals bodies debating all these bans and things like that and spending millions and millions of (unintelligible) regulation and things like that, but in my memory or in my whatever, the history that I have read, I have not seen a single country being punished for using chemical weapons; so what's the point of having all this laws and bans in place when we can't implement it properly?",
        "Hmm.",
        "Well, as we look at it, Jonathan Tucker, certainly Iraq suffered no punishment for its use of chemical warfare against Iran, or for that matter against the Kurds, though belatedly, perhaps.",
        "And you point out that Egypt never suffered any serious punishment or even serious investigation, for that matter, of its use of chemical weapons in Yemen.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "I mean, these - these agreements are only as effective as they are enforceable, and that is a weakness.",
        "Even though these laws are on the books, they must be enforced to be fully credible."

        "Even so, I think the very existence of a norm that has been signed on by the vast majority of nation states has, in itself, a very powerful effect, a deterrent effect, on countries that would think of using these weapons.",
        "That doesn't mean there won't be use, but I think it's much less likely than if the treaties did not exist and these weapons were accepted as legitimate means of warfare.",
        "VAROON(ph) (Caller): So basically, historically speaking, none of the country has been punished so far, and - just a curiosity?",
        "In terms of formal legal proceeding, one problem is that the use of these weapons is not considered a crime against humanity, or it hasn't been formally designated as such.",
        "So that, for example, a head of state that employed such weapons cannot be brought before the International Criminal Court and made legally liable as an individual.",
        "These treaties apply to states rather than individuals.",
        "I think that might have a deterrent effect if a head of state who was contemplating the use of chemical weapons knew that such use was banned under international criminal law.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Isn't it also fair to say, though, that every case where they've been used, they've been used in a war, where even outside powers have interest in seeing who wins and who loses, interests that are more important to them, perhaps, than the violation of a treaty on chemical weapons.",
        "Yeah, chemical weapons have also been used in a few cases by terrorists…",
        "Yes.",
        "…so that would be an example of non state use.",
        "But, in general, you're right.",
        "There is a process of escalation.",
        "Usually, the -what happens is that countries start using tear gas, non lethal agents on the battlefield, and then escalate to ever-more toxic agents, initially blister agents, and finally, nerve agents, as happened in the Iran-Iraq War.",
        "As we look at the enforcement regimes on these - on the chemical weapons, and, again, it's - if they don't have it, we don't have to have it is an argument.",
        "But, as we pointed out - you pointed out earlier, I think, in alluding to the Middle East, there are still situations where Syria, for example, wants chemical weapons to balance Israel's nuclear weapons.",
        "And there are other imbalances like that, that people think can be addressed by chemical weapons.",
        "Yes, one difference, I think, is that there are effective defenses against chemical weapons.",
        "They impose certain military liabilities.",
        "So one of the rationales when we did have a chemical weapons program was that, on the one hand, we needed to deter the Soviets.",
        "We have, of course, other weapons of mass destruction; we have nuclear weapons; we have very powerful, conventional forces.",
        "Mm-hmm."

        "And our troops are very well protected against chemical weapons.",
        "But if they go into a chemical environment, they have to suit up.",

        "Okay, Iraq actually began to acquire chemical weapons as early as the 1970s.",
        "And, initially, they did so under the cover of acquiring a pesticide industry.",
        "And, unfortunately, many western countries, and a few companies in the United States, provided dual-use equipment, that is production equipment that could be used to make legitimate chemicals, but also, and in the case of Iraq, was used to make chemical weapons."

        "And this is a rather sad chapter, but there have been developments since then that are designed to make these supply relationships much more difficult.",
        "We - in 1985, there was an organization called the Australia Group that was established that imposes harmonized export controls on dual-use chemicals, precursor chemicals, and equipment that can be used to make chemical weapons, in order to impede the efforts of proliferators to acquire the necessary technology.",
        "This regime is not 100 percent airtight, but it has made it much more difficult for proliferators to acquire the necessary technology.",
        "Were there any other countries that had contributed to their -besides the United States - other countries - can you speak to (unintelligible)?",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "Well, Germany, Switzerland, Italy.",
        "There were a wide variety of countries that provided dual-use equipment, sometimes unwittingly, but, in a few cases, wittingly.",
        "There have been - there were trials in Germany of Karl Kolb, for example.",
        "This was a company that was deeply involved in Iraq's chemical weapons program and provided turnkey plants for the production of mustard and nerve gas in Iraq.",
        "So clearly, there is a - there were unscrupulous businessmen that were deeply implicated because there was a lot money to be made in this kind of dark business.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "It should be pointed out that Iraq was hardly the first country to try to hide its chemical weapons project as an insecticide project.",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "Egypt also acquired a nerve agent capability under the cover of a pesticide program.",
        "And long before that, the Nazis produced - actually discovered nerve agents in the course of pesticide research.",
        "And they actually discovered a chemical called tabun that was so - so lethal that it could not be used safely as a pesticide and was turned into a chemical weapon.",

        "Yes, that's right.",
        "There has been historical debate over why chemical weapons were not used in World War II, and there are a number of different theories.",
        "One is that mutual deterrence prevailed.",
        "The Nazis knew that the Allies possessed large stock of phosgene and mustard gas, which had been invented during World War I and were stockpiled in large quantities.",
        "For one thing, there is a disagreement on the size of the abandoned stockpile.",

        "But the Germans had discovered a new generation of chemical weapons called the nerve agents quite by chance, during pesticide research, as I mentioned.",
        "And they considered, on many occasions during the war, the possibility of unleashing these secret weapons, but they were deterred by, actually, an intelligence failure.",
        "The German intelligence suspected that the United States and Russia had also developed nerve agents.",
        "This turned out to be not the case, even though there was research going on very actively in both countries, they did not make the breakthrough involved - required, in coming up with a molecular structure that was uniquely toxic.",
        "And, as a result, the Germans were self-deterred from initiating the use of the weapons.",
        "By the end of the war, of course, their cities were very vulnerable to aerial attack, and Roosevelt and Churchill made explicit deterrent threats that if the Germans initiated the use of chemical weapons, the Allies would respond in kind and devastate German cities.",
        "And, Adolph Hitler, himself, had been gassed during the First World War and had a strong aversion to the use of chemical weapons -well, outside of concentration camps, anyway.",
        "That's correct.",
        "Hitler, during one of the final battles of World War I, had been exposed to mustard gas and temporarily blinded, which was a deeply traumatic experience.",
        "So he had a deep aversion to chemical weapons.",
        "And even though members of the Nazi inner circle, such as Goeble, Borman, and Lye(ph), advocated on many occasions for the German use of the nerve agents against the Red Army; Hitler always equivocated, could not make up his mind, I think in part, because of his deep aversion to these weapons.",
