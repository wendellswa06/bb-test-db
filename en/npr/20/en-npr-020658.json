        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I was very curious where - in a related question to what you were just talking about - the pharmaceutical industry, and the use of various drugs that could potentially be used as, you know, chemical weapons.",
        "I think that in the grand scheme for something like mustard gas, it would be unlikely.",
        "But, for example, the Chechan incident, the theater incident that you just discussed, could they have been using an inhalational anesthetic for that and, hence, that could be categorized as a, quote, \"\"chemical weapon\"\"?",
        "Where do we draw the line?",
        "And also, is there any history of the pharmaceutical industry being manipulated in a way to produce potential agents?",
        "Okay, in terms of the composition of the gas that was used in the Moscow theater incident, it's believed to have contained pheninthal(ph), which is an anesthetic gas that is widely used in operating theaters around the world, of course, under very controlled conditions.",
        "But it's believed that the gas was a complex mixture that contained other elements that are not fully understood.",
        "In terms of the role of the pharmaceutical industry and the chemical industry, during World War I, the chemical industry was deeply involved in production of chemical weapons.",
        "And, in fact, they lobbied strongly against the ratification of the Geneva Protocol, which was the first treaty to ban the use in war of chemical weapons back in 1925.",
        "And, in part, because of the lobbying efforts of the American Chemical Society and the chemical industry, the treaty never came up for a vote in the Senate.",
        "And it was not until 1975, 50 years later, that the United States finally ratified it.",
        "Today, the chemical industry is a strong advocate of chemical arms control.",
        "In fact, they played a key role in the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention back in 1997 in persuading the Republican-controlled Senate to support this treaty, even though there were concerns that it would have an adverse effect on industry because it involves intrusive inspections of chemical plants, and there was concern about risk to proprietary information, for example.",
        "But the chemical industry, knowing the public relations benefits of opposing and eliminating any association with chemical warfare, was a strong advocate of the treaty.",
        "So that was, I think, a very important change of heart on the part of the chemical industry.",
        "The pharmaceutical industry is more involved in the Biological Weapons Convention, in terms of the productions of vaccines and other biological products.",
        "Jim, I thank you very much for the call.",

        "Sure.",
        "I just have a general question, and it has to do with - wondering whether you could expound on the morality and the ethical aspects of industrialized nations developing weapons of mass destruction and, basically, selling them to other countries when we know that these weapons are being fabricated, basically, to annihilate the private citizens of different countries, not necessarily soldiers of an aggressor nation.",
        "So - I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "Okay, is that right, Jonathan Tucker?",
        "Do you - certainly in World War I, they were intended for use against military troops, even Yemen…",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…and the Egyptian case, were attacking what they thought were -clearly they made mistakes, and civilians were hit…",
        "Right.",
        "…but Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons against the Kurds is unusual in that respect.",
        "Now, a fair number of years passed between his death and when you decided to create this dance to memorialize him.",
        "Why did that amount of time have to pass (unintelligible)?",
        "Yeah, I think it's important to distinguish between tactical weapons and strategic weapons.",
        "Chemical weapons were really designed for battlefield use.",
        "They - very large quantities are required to cover these - the size of a city.",
        "So they are not really contemplated as strategic weapons the way nuclear weapons would be used against entire cities.",
        "So perhaps there is some distinction there.",
        "Whether chemical weapons should be called weapons of mass destruction is somewhat debatable.",
        "They are really more tactical or battlefield weapons.",
        "The whole issue of morality, when one gets into the military realm, is very, very difficult.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And, of course, we've gone on to invent more horrible chemical weapons, but, nevertheless, he was not alone in his theory.",
        "Yes.",
        "But there was something I think uniquely horrible and insidious that fed into deep primal fears in human nature that I think has made these weapons easier to ban or easier to de-legitimate to make beyond the pale than other categories of weapons.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "It is perhaps to be hoped that, in the future, nuclear weapons will fall into the same category, that we will someday view nuclear weapons with the same horror that we view chemical weapons.",

        "The first use of chemical weapons in that war was by Germany in April of 1915.",
        "So the war had been going on for more than two years by the time the U.S.",
        "intervened and, at that time, there was large-scale use of chemical weapons by all sides.",
        "And the U.S.",
        "was totally unprepared for this new threat.",
        "We had to be supplied with defensive equipment by our allies.",
        "And there was a crash program, a mini Manhattan Project, back in 1917, to develop large quantities of mustard gas and other—phosgene - other chemical weapons, so that we would be in a position to retaliate.",

        "has not used these weapons."

        "Yes.",
        "There was a very extensive program of human experimentation, not involving deliberate killing of individuals, but determining the effects of low dose exposure to mustard and nerve agents.",
