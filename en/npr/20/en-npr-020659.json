        "In the case of Aum Shinrikyo, this was, I think, an extraordinary cult.",

        "But they were engaged in a wide variety of legitimate and illegitimate activities and amassed, literally, hundreds of millions of dollars.",
        "So they had extraordinary resources.",

        "And even so, they were not able to produce large quantities of sarin.",
        "They produced small quantities.",
        "They imported a turnkey chemical plant from Switzerland, ostensibly for legitimate reasons.",
        "But actually set up a production line for sarin, but they were never able to get it operating effectively.",
        "And to carry out the infamous Tokyo subway attack, they actually synthesized a relatively small amount of sarin in a laboratory, not using their big factory.",
        "They did it over a 24-hour period, so it was a very rushed job.",
        "The sarin was only about 30 percent pure.",
        "And they did not have a delivery system.",
        "They simply poured it into plastic bags, which operatives then took on subway cars and punctured with sharpened umbrellas.",
        "And, as a result, there were limited fatalities from that attack.",
        "There were 12 dead.",
        "Upwards of 1000 people had, more or less, nonfatal injuries.",
        "But the psychological impact of this attack was devastating.",
        "And I think this is an important lesson: Even though it's difficult to inflict mass casualties with chemical or even biological weapons, they have a disproportionate psychological impact because of their insidious nature and the fact that they feed into our deepest fears.",

        "And also, some of the countries in the Mid-East, you know, have threatened various forms of terrorist activities.",
        "So, my question is, if there is not a successful effort to adequately stop proliferation of chemical weapons, how do you think that might impact the likelihood of proliferation through terrorism, number one?",
        "And number two, what do you think the likelihood that such terrorism taking place in American cities might be state sponsored or political terrorism?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "We do know that bin Laden has expressed openly interest in acquiring unconventional weapons.",
        "In fact, he said it was his religious duty to do so.",
        "There are allegations that when the government of Sudan was controlled by an Islamist, al-Tourabi, that there was close cooperation between bin Laden and the government of Sudan that may have included the development of chemical weapons."

        "And you may recall that the United States, during the Clinton administration, attacked a pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, called the Al Shifa plant, on the grounds that it was involved in the production of VX nerve agent.",
        "Now, those allegations later came into question when there did not appear to be hard evidence of a link between that plant and chemical weapons production.",
        "But even so, there is pretty clear evidence of interest on the part of al-Qaida in working with the government of Sudan to acquire chemical weapons.",
        "Now, whether they did so at al-Shifa is a matter of debate.",
        "So I think this is a disturbing development.",
        "And to the extent that al-Qaida still exists as a coherent organization, I think they are likely to want to pursue chemical weapons.",
        "Whether they have the capacity to produce large quantities and to deliver them effectively, I think is unclear.",
        "The scenario that actually troubles me the most is industrial sabotage, because we have many chemical facilities in this country that work with toxic chemicals, that store them on site, that transport them.",
        "And I think this is perhaps the most likely scenario of al-Qaida using our technology against us the way they did on September 11th, turning passenger aircraft into bombs.",
        "They might try to turn our very own chemical plants into chemical bombs to be used against us.",

        "So why are you blaming the 1960s?",
        "Mr.",
        "McWHORTER: Well, Neal, that summary that you just did of the book was so perfect that it's knocked the wind out of me completely.",
        "That says it all perfectly.",
        "But it was the '60s because this was the time when you can see, based on the documentation of history, that there were profound changes in what was going on in black communities.",
        "And it's very important when you mention the part about welfare--it's definitely not the beginning of welfare that was the problem because welfare, of course, had existed for 35 years by then.",
        "It wasn't intended for black people.",
        "It's that welfare administration changed deeply, specifically between 1966 and 1970, and it created a situation where it was possible for someone who had had children in whatever situation to never work again and to pass on that lifestyle to their own progeny, whether or not the male person who helped create the children was around, able-bodied or working.",
        "That kind of welfare hadn't existed until the late '60s, and that's a chapter of black history that gets lost when, in fact, it was that change in policy that created a great many of the things or enabled a great many of the things that became so tragically familiar in black communities.",
        "And then there was also a change in what activism meant from the early '60s to the late '60s.",
        "And so despite the fact that it's a bit of a cliche to blame those nasty '60s for all sorts of things, the truth is that black America in 1970 was more different from black America in 1860 than any other decade in black America's 400-year history.",
        "But what was it about the attitude?",
        "You're talking about, I guess, a distinction between--What?--the SCLC and the Black Panthers?",

        "I don't know what the Supreme Court is going to decide in this case upcoming where they have to rule on the constitutionality of assigning students to schools by race in some other districts.",
        "But it's a conservative court so, you know, we better brace ourselves.",
        "And the other point that I would make here, you know, the fundamental issue here is that the resources available to schools differ by - because of local autonomy of school control and local tax reliance - they differ by the incomes of the communities that people live in.",
        "The complaint of some of the people who want to see this bussing order lifted is that the people coming in from the black community in Birmingham don't pay property taxes out there.",
        "And the truth of the matter is if you can afford to pay the property taxes in an upscale suburban community, you can afford to buy good public schools for your kids.",

        "And that's not really a matter of race.",

        "Well, Laura, how about this.",
        "I mean it is a matter of cash but at the same time, you know - and this is a debate that could go on and on and on - but if you look at why people earn what they do, at least part of that is due to race.",
        "So at some point is there a compelling government interest that says, well, we realize not everybody may be able to buy their way into a good school district.",

        "I think, though, that Glenn is correct in that we have passed into a new era.",
        "And part of the issue, I think in some sense there's been a backlash in some communities, from the African-American community, about bussing and about desegregation and the cultural and sociological position that we should demand equal schools, economically viable schools in our communities, and not be forced to demand or go to white communities in order to get the education that we value.",
        "But, Laura, if the federal government, as I understand it, only contributes 8 percent of school budgets and the rest of it is state and local, then it's going to be pretty difficult to have that kind of equity in black schools.",
