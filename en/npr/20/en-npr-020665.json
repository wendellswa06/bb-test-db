        "I, with all sincerity, don't think it's correct, and that's because I've looked at deindustrialization in various places.",
        "And the one that I emphasize in the book is Indianapolis, and I'll just put it very simply.",
        "In Indianapolis, the factories did not move away, and yet the exact same inner-city problems arose, one of many indications, including scholarly ones that we don't hear about, that that idea, although it's very memory friendly and despite the fact that its primary proponent, William Julius Wilson, is an august figure, is not as correct as we think, nor, frankly, do I think it was even a significant contributing factor, which I argue for very specifically and carefully in the book.",
        "As for segregated schools, conflicts issue--we have to be careful, though, because even today we have many all-minority or all-black small schools taught by teachers who care on shoestring budgets that do very well.",

        "McWHORTER: ...that were all black--yeah, that's right--those kids were actually kicking the proverbial butts of the white kids, which is to show that just the fact that all the kids are the same color can't be seen as the problem.",

        "And although she is very much on the side of the people and she has a kind of a utopian vision of what the system should provide that I don't think is useful because simply we know it's not going to happen and there are other ways, she says that there is this attitude problem, although she thinks that it's due to other things.",
        "So that leaves us with the white worker who has encountered what people like this--and those two are an example of dozens and dozens of social scientists who would document this sort of thing--what are they do to do, given the fact that the attitude problem really is more common among people of a certain profile and others?",
        "That's a question that we have to ask, rather than, I think, in this particular case going back to the older message of: Don't have biased views against people.",

        "And kids are pretty smart, and they've figured that out pretty quickly--that being whacked out on drugs is not something to be proud of.",
