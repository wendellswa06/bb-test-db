        "Hi.",
        "Thanks for your--thanks for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "I had a comment to make to your guest.",
        "I'm from Detroit, and I think Detroit is the example of what a city can be...",
        "Mr. McWHORTER: Paradigm...",
        "...the failure--what extent the city failure can be because of racial segregation, because of wealth that is not rightly distributed, equally distributed.",
        "But Detroit--in the past five years, there has been a very serious gentrification effort from the authorities.",
        "And the African-American population in Detroit is 82 percent, and now they're trying to get back, you know, people--you know, open businesses back in Detroit now, so on and so forth.",
        "And lately we've been seeing wealthy people going back, living downtown, opening ...(unintelligible) so on and so forth.",
        "And the city has been slowly changing.",
        "But did it come pretty quickly or did you have to mull this one over a little bit?",
        "Mr.",
        "McWHORTER: That's a very important point, and there's a good scheme that's good for our minds in that you have all of this opportunity that seems to be churning and yet a culture stays the same.",
        "Yes, it is not right that in our country we have that kind of racial disparity.",
        "Definitely it has its roots in racism, and the racism that mattered, I think, wasn't that long ago.",
        "But there are a million answers to that, but I'm just going to leave it at this.",
        "Let's say that we're in Detroit, and let's say we're in a certain kind of neighborhood.",
        "And there's someone who's standing on the corner.",
        "Let's make it a neighborhood where that person standing on the corner is a black American person, and he's selling drugs.",
        "Now there are two ways of looking at it.",
        "One is that he's selling drugs because that's the only opportunity that he has.",
        "I daresay that that's the one that we're taught we're supposed to believe, as people who listen to NPR and read The Atlantic and eat Brie cheese, etc. That's supposed to be the compassionate view.",
        "I think that there is another compassionate view.",
        "Suppose that person is doing that because it's all they've ever seen.",
        "They've grown up in a society where many men do that, especially when they get to that age.",
        "And certainly they see that you can make a certain amount of money.",
        "It's all they know; it's their norm.",
        "So if you're in Scarsdale, it's your norm to obsess too much over the SAT.",
        "That's not what all human beings do.",
        "It's what you do there.",
        "It might be a norm to develop all sorts of psychological disorders, whatever they do there.",
        "In this guy's neighborhood, that's all that he's ever known, and he may do that even if there were various programs he could have used, such as, for example, getting just a high school diploma or all sorts of things, not that those programs would have made him like a Scarsdale resident, except with brown skin, but he probably could have done better than that."

        "Now are we going to moralize against that guy?",
        "No. It's all he ever knew, just like what we do is all we ever knew.",
        "But the issue is: How do we address that kind of culture, so that we can connect people with the opportunities that are there, often those opportunities being special organizations often funded by large, white funding sources that are trying to help inner-city youth go in a different direction?",
        "So, yes, it's a grievous mistake that we have these kinds of disparities, but here, for years past the Great Society, I think we need to consider, as even social scientists do generally in footnotes or in final paragraphs, that what we see now in the present tense might be due to just people patterning themselves on all they've seen rather than forces still actively coercing them to do certain things.",
        "Because the welfare regulations have changed.",
        "Mr.",
        "McWHORTER: Exactly.",
        "And what we see now is a culture that's blinking in the light after 30 years of tragic disincentives to do any better than that, which happens to people of any race.",
        "There are examples of white people being at the welfare teat after the Civil War.",

        "Though--there's been a lot of talk of, like, white flight and that's a major reason for the African-American culture--the condition that it's in.",
        "But I'd like to make a comment along the lines that the cultural icons that the African-American culture tends to emulate are more towards, like, 50 Cent and the rappers and that whole genre.",
        "And then when you have people that speak against that, like Mr. Cosby, for instance, he's vilified.",
        "He doesn't get the airplay that those people like 50 Cent and the rappers normally get.",
        "And another point I'd like to make is the fact that people like Mr. Sharpton and Mr. Jackson seem to get a lot of airplay when others that speak against, you know, the popular items of the day--they don't get as much airplay.",
        "And I think that has a lot to do with there."

        "Well, there's a couple of questions in there, John McWhorter.",
        "Mr.",
        "McWHORTER: I want to leave room for another caller, so I'll just complement that by saying there's an academic orthodoxy that has a kind of contempt for the black middle class that moved out of the inner city that is chilling.",
        "And I openly admit that it's chilling to me because it's my parents.",
        "In 1969, they weren't supposed to move out of the crumbling neighborhood they lived in because they were supposed to serve as role models for the poorer people who they left behind.",
        "Then often the very same people or people from the very same set will say that a Cosby or some other people that we won't name are wrong for criticizing the rap culture because people like 50 Cent and Jay-Z.",
        "And people don't only mean the conscience rappers.",
        "They mean people like 50 Cent and Jay-Z are somehow given a message to the powers that be and that, therefore, it's a good thing that poor black people have these rappers to look to as their new icons.",
        "Tupac would be a perfectly good example.",
        "I find this incoherent, and I think it's time that we look beyond that set for counsel on how to get black America ahead.",
        "But aren't those rappers expressing genuine emotion?",
        "I just believe in whatever you're going to do, even if it's work, have a little bit of fun attitude about it.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Mr.",
        "McWHORTER: They're expressing emotion, but for what?",
        "As I often say, acting up isn't activism.",
        "If you have emotion and you're in a newsreel on what went on in Birmingham in the early and mid-1960s, the emotion was designed to break down the walls of segregation and give people a chance to succeed.",
        "But if we've got a situation where there are women who are past their five-year limit on welfare and they're trying to do something besides live hand to mouth and create a good environment for their children or if we're dealing with an AIDS crisis or even if we're dealing with discrepancies in loans, insurance, cars, etc,.",
        "etc, what does it do for somebody to say, `Stand up, stand up,' or, `George Bush is a racist,' or, `I drive by and I see people sitting on their steps, mothers with children'?",
        "There's nothing wrong with that music, but it doesn't teach us to do anything, and so it becomes rather inert.",
        "Kelsey(ph), I'm sorry, I cut you off earlier.",
        "No, what I was going to say is, when are submerged in that type of culture, you know, you're not really thinking about I could find the next, you know, fuel to get us out of the solar system in half the time or I could find something, you know, that's going to be a contribution to society.",
        "You're thinking--your whole thought process is totally opposite.",
        "You know, you're submerging yourself into a whole different criminal culture and it leaves no room for economic growth."

        "And I think what it also has done, it doesn't really offer a place for, at least a public place in a large sense, for people who are liberal and people who have liberal ideas or to have a place where you can actually call yourself, proudly call yourself a religious person.",
