        "The challenge is to be able to take these liberal, tolerant, humanistic values to get beyond ourselves and our families.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "For Jews, the story of the exodus from Egypt, leaving Egypt in haste and seven days later crossing the Red Sea, is meant to be a story that tells us something about the place of the outsider and the stranger; something that enshrines in memory the notion that we were slaves.",
        "It's meant to be a story that is both about physical liberation and spiritual liberation.",
        "These stories, especially read through the prism of thousands of years of interpretation, are unsurpassed in their profundity.",

        "I had no savings account.",
        "I mean I had to pay cash to my apartment because the check had bounced enough times.",
        "So I would bring down my color TV set, a Sears TV with a cable snaked into it - they had no video-in back in those days - and hooked it up to the circuit of very few chips and then a little keyboard you could type on.",
        "And I was trying to impress people with how did he do it with fewer chips than anyone could ever imagine?",

        "As a matter of fact, I sat there with the Apple I we just described.",

        "Every computer since the Apple I has had a keyboard as its, you know, its look.",

        "And you don't have time to think about companies and products and how would I build this.",
        "So Steve Jobs and I were a very necessary pair.",
        "And his first idea was really not even to build a computer.",
        "It was just - he had come from the surplus electronics parts world, where you go into a store and you see all these parts, like switches and relays..."

        "They don't have to attach thousands of wires.",
        "That extra labor, that extra time was what kept them from building their own computers from my schematic.",

        "But all the Mac people felt so much that I was a part of that project, even though I didn't finish with it, that we all had our signatures on the inside and so nobody can see them.",

        "You know it's there.",

        "Music itself to the person took a whole lot of steps.",
        "It took a service that could sell you songs at a reasonable price, download them easily with almost not steps, no work, no hassle on your part; put it into a computer and then you plugged the iPod in, and magically, with no steps on your own, it gets into this device you can carry with you, a satellite of a computer."
