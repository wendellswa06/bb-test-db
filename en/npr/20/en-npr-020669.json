        "I never sensed really bad blood between Microsoft and Apple.",
        "A lot of Macintosh users feel badly about PCs and do have some bad feelings.",
        "I call them Macintosh bigots a little.",
        "They say, oh, no, only the Macintosh is the good one, and I don't like to be that way.",
        "And it comes from the fact that there were points in time when we were told that because the Macintosh had nice little pictures and icons and a mouse and cursors and menus, it had all these wonderful things, and in the PC you had to type and memorize commands to move a file from here to there, you had to remember all the names of the paths it was in, the folders, the disks it was on - and we were told by the business people because you have pictures, you're a toy, and we didn't like that.",
        "And we knew we had a better machine just as capable of any calculation, and yet it was being called a toy and that you could only do real work, real powerful work when you have this machine where you type, you know, C-colon-slash-slash, and you know, you type in...",
        "Right.",
        "I've seen the commercial now.",
        "I'm a Mac.",
        "I'm a PC.",
        "They...",
        "And it was - you know - and that made us feel, yeah, but we were being put down for something that we knew as users was a wrong assessment.",
        "And now of course every computer in the world is a Macintosh now, so we were right.",
        "Nobody ever came back and apologized and said, hey, you were right.",
        "Is iPod the revenge, Apple's revenge?",
        "No, no, no. I think Apple's revenge is just the fact that Windows, you know, PCs all became Macintoshes in a way."

        "The iPod I think is - has a big advantage that the Apple II had.",
        "The Apple II started this company, had so many bucks pouring in all the way, and we weren't even passed by the IBM PC in sales until 1983.",
        "And well through the early Macintosh years, the Apple II was earning so much money for the company.",
        "It was an open system, so accessible to other people, individuals.",
        "Even high school students in their own homes could figure out how to design circuits to plug in that would make it do something fantastic with music equipment.",
        "They could write software that would play games.",
        "Tons of little guys had this opening, so you didn't have one company selling the Apple II, which is Apple.",
        "You had a thousand companies selling products for the Apple II.",
        "Here's the iPod.",
        "You got 3,000 companies making accessories for it.",
        "Sure, most of them might be cases, something pretty simple.",
        "But when you walk into a store you see iPod this, iPod that, iPod this, iPod this.",
        "No wonder we have 75 percent of the market.",
        "It looks like we dominate all - you know, if you buy an iPod, I'm going to have all these extra things I can add onto it.",
        "That's attractive to people.",
        "If I buy the next device that might be sitting there on its own with a couple of that company's accessories, but I'm limited.",
        "Why did Apple lose the race in the office?",
        "Why did - why was Mac not successful in, you know, in competing with PC?",
        "Yeah.",
        "When the PC came out we were really competing up front with it, with the way people were using Apple IIs in the office, which was a little bit higher resolution monitor and a little more memory to do larger spreadsheets, larger financial forecasts.",
        "So we built this machine called the Apple III to be that machine.",
        "The Apple III had a bunch of problems in its - some I believe in its conception, some in the features that it was forced to have.",
        "We were a marketing-driven company, so marketing defined the product - not engineering -so it wasn't that much fun to a raw engineer like the Apple II was.",
        "It also had hardware problems and software problems from day one.",
        "And even if we correct them a year later, it's got a bad name.",
        "So the Apple III never took off.",
        "But I think the real reason was computers were now finding their place in companies where people at their desks would sit down and do a bunch of forecasts and calculations and prepare documents for meetings that they couldn't even do with the company computers.",
        "This one was now better.",
        "And those companies had IBM purchasing ability already.",
        "Managers were allowed to buy anything that was approved, that was IBM, because IBM was already in the company selling mainframes.",
        "So when IBM came out with the PCs it was so easy for managers to buy a few PCs.",
        "Right.",
        "It kind of like nickel change for their projects maybe, and Apples were a much harder purchase."
