        "So they are standing up and turning people out, say--telling us, you know, things we need to know, and they're helping us out a lot.",
        "Because, like I say, these people are trying to get out of here.",
        "Well, Officer, just know that--and I know sometimes it isn't always comforting--but you got a lot of folks praying for you.",

        "But hopefully--I wish I'll go into a house and couldn't find anyone.",
        "And what--the chance of that happening is very slim, because to this day, we don't know what the death toll is, but we know it is extremely high.",
        "Well, again, we'll say a prayer for you.",
        "And you hang in there, and I hope you're reunited with your family real soon.",

        "Yes, and it's - for some reason, the court refused to release the tapes.",
        "In any case, tell us about this case, it's the FCC versus Fox Television Station.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, as you know, about four years ago the FCC announced a crackdown on what they called fleeting expletives.",
        "Before, the rule was that you could probably get away with an occasional word on a program.",

        "We're going to presume that's illegal.",

        "So, today the argument was, should the court allow this new government policy to go into effect?",
        "And this is 30 years since the court itself revisited the issue.",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "John Stevens is the only one on the court that had anything to do with this issue in the past.",
        "He wrote the five-to-four opinion in the George Carlin case, the famous case of the seven dirty words.",
        "That opinion sort of stood for the proposition if you do what George Carlin, you say these words over and over again during the midday hours, that's indecent.",
        "But everybody assumed that an occasional use or an inadvertent use - a lot of these, as you know, are inadvertent.",
        "Fox TV, for example, didn't plan on somebody getting - like Cher saying something like that on awards program, it just was blurted out by a guest.",
        "And they've since instituted these delay systems to have some control over it, and that's a technological fix.",
        "Nevertheless, live sports events, somebody, an athlete who is miced or somebody in the crowd, even, can shout out these events and broadcasters have appealed in their side of this case saying, look, how are we supposed to tell the difference between the film \"\"Saving Private Ryan,\"\" when it's apparently OK when soldiers use these words under situations of enormous stress, and then a PBS station gets fined when a blues singer uses one of these words in a documentary.",
        "How are we supposed to know what to do?",
        "Well, that's exactly the argument the broadcasters are making, that this policy is arbitrary, and it's sort of hard to guess in advance what you're going to get fined for.",
        "John Roberts and Antonin Scalia, who did most of the talking, were strongly in favor of the government's view.",
        "Their view is like the average parent who's complaining about this, that why can't you have sort of a safe harbor on television where nobody is going, at 8 o'clock at night, an awards program or some sort of a family program, they're going to get hit with this language.",
        "John Roberts has two little kids; you could tell this was sort of a personal matter for him.",
