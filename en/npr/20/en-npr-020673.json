        "It's evolved over that period.",

        "But there's been continuity every since.",
        "And the monarchy seems to act as a catalyst and as continuity and stability in times of crisis.",
        "I think, for example, last year - after the bombings in London on the subway on the 7th of July - there was a couple of days afterwards a two-minute silence.",
        "And the Queen stood defiantly outside the building of Buckingham Palace, under the central archway, observing the two-minute silence as everybody else was doing throughout the United Kingdom.",

        "In the Falklands War, certainly, in World War II, the monarchy was seen and was around all the time and traveling around the bombed areas of London and the rest of the United Kingdom.",
        "So in times of crisis, yeah, we turn to the monarchy, but we do - we, I mean, the great British people do tend to find time to criticize it as well.",
        "Sure, but it is a - in that sense, an expression of the nation, of the state, as it were, as opposed to whatever government of the day may be in charge.",
        "Yeah, most certainly, and you've hit it right on the head.",
        "I mean, for example, you know, people say, well, what about the popularity of the monarchy?",
        "Well, the monarchy's enjoyed a sort of 70 to 74 percent popularity, certainly, during this reign.",
        "And the monarch, i.e., Queen Elizabeth II, has joined - enjoyed a popularity of over 80 percent, so it's been stable even in times of crisis.",
        "Even in the worst year, the queen called the annus horribilis...",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "...or for your American listeners, the bum year, 1992 - even in that period, she still enjoyed popularity, and there was still no call for a republic.",
        "And interestingly, now that she has celebrated her 80th birthday -she celebrated her golden jubilee in 2002; she'll celebrate her diamond wedding anniversary next year - the republican movement, which amounts to about 15 percent of the population, if that, now turn round and say, the queen is untouchable.",
        "And therefore, they've retreated into their burrows, and we hear nothing from them.",
        "No doubt as she does get older and probably becomes infirmed - which there's no likelihood of at the moment because she's as fit as a fiddle - they will crawl out of the woodwork and start making noises that we've gotta reform the monarchy.",
        "But at the moment, she is untouchable and she is popular.",
        "There are about 10 monarchies, overall, in Europe these days, most of them rather more modest and less grandiose than the British royal family."

        "But among the myths, you say, is the idea that there was a decided Southern strategy by the Nixon campaign going back to, what, 1968, to pick up white racist votes in the South.",
        "Oh, I don't dispute that Republicans have - just like Democrats, have sought Southern voters over the decades.",
        "In fact, Eisenhower had a Southern strategy of sorts, starting in the early 1950s, trying to realign that enormous region to make it more competitive for his party.",
        "I only suggest that just because the Republicans sought Southern white votes, including no doubt from Strom Thurmond and others who were not exactly racially progressive at the time, does not mean that they actually gave them much in return for their votes.",
        "And the general notion is that in return for those votes, they had to give the Thurmonds of this world everything they wanted.",
        "And I don't think that's really accurately reflected in the Nixon campaign or its policy record afterward."

        "The Nixon policy record, you say, on civil rights was fairly progressive.",
        "Well, it's varied.",
        "I mean, it famously - Richard Nixon, for better or worse - any conservatives, of course, would disown him for this - but is considered the sort of the parent of modern affirmative action, of a lot of federal contracting set-asides for minority-owned business, for example.",
        "But also if one looks carefully at his record of judicial nominations and even school desegregation in the South - the two most, if you will, notorious areas where he was understood to have retreated the most on civil rights - I think his record, if you look at it really closely and talk to a lot of the participants, is much more mixed than civil rights advocates had at the time, which is why Thurmond and other opponents were frequently as frustrated with Nixon as his critics to his left were.",
        "And you argue that, in fact, he got a lot of white votes in the South despite his policies, not because of them, largely because George Wallace was shot.",
        "We know that - in 1968, obviously, George Wallace had enormous support in the Deep South that Richard Nixon didn't, and we know from polls that going into the 1972 election, had Wallace remained viable, those Southerners would clearly have preferred Wallace to him.",
        "And that's not because therefore they were - they did not perceive Nixon as one of them or as offering them what they really wanted, whereas Wallace might.",
        "And it was only when Wallace was removed as an option that they really were left with little choice.",
        "And I suggest in a larger book project coming out of this, that that's really not a bad metaphor for us here.",
        "And that is that those Southerners ended up coming to the Republican Party because the party proved to be the mountain to which they had to go, not the other way around.",
        "And it can be argued that they were just as effectively being driven out of the Democratic Party rather than flocking to the Republican Party.",
        "Partly because of civil rights, of course, but also partly because the Democratic Party was understandably undergoing -revolution maybe too strong a word - but they were undergoing an enormous transformation in their views about international affairs and the Vietnam War in particular, about changing cultural mores.",
        "And some of the same progressive steps they were taking - very early steps on gay rights, obviously, some steps on feminism and women's roles in political life and even private life - those clashed at the time very severely with a lot of more traditional Southern social mores.",
        "And I should point out that in his article, Gerard Alexander does say that there are people - extremists in the Republican Party who can probably be safely categorized as bigots, just as he argues there are people in the Democratic Party who hate people on the basis of class.",
        "So that he's not saying this never comes up.",
        "But it's come up in some fairly ugly contexts in the most current campaign.",
        "Well, we're talking about the Arizona law that - on immigration that would require policemen, in the course of their duties, to demand papers - citizen papers of anybody they thought might be an illegal alien - an illegal immigrant, rather.",
