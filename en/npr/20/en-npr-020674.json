        "I would be the first to say that there are clearly Southern bigots who ended up voting for Republican candidates like Richard Nixon and later Ronald Reagan, people who were former Wallace voters.",
        "I would be a lot more careful before stipulating or agreeing that, for example, the Arizona immigration law is manifestly bigoted.",
        "I think what has happened in the last 20-plus years, maybe more -pollsters and others would know better than I - is that I think liberals and conservatives have evolved two different notions of what American national identity is.",
        "And I think that's part of what's gets wrapped up in disputes that each side talks about the other's patriotism, or questions that are - wonders whether people are really loyal to the republic, and that's partly because we've come to define that republic a little bit differently from each other.",
        "This is something I worry about that - I worried that we're coming to see each other as an Other, in a capital O.",
        "And I think one of those distinctions is that conservatives believe in - that the Republican needs a core of common cultural values, which they perceived as threatened by very high levels of even legal immigration, by linguistic fracturing in the country, which is why, for example, conservatives long supported English-only laws.",
        "But I'm very hesitant to say that those are ethnically bigoted.",
        "So, for example - as I mentioned in the op-ed piece in the Post, which I encourage people to read, of course - that...",
        "There's a link to it on our website.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That Republican primary voters, this cycle, have seemed to be delighted to - they seemed to even bend over backwards to vote for African-American and Hispanic and women candidates of - across the country, who seemed to share their values.",
        "And in that sense, I think they - as I put it in the article, they are more interested in the software of people's values and ideas than the hardware of their DNA.",
        "Two questions, one historic and one more recent.",
        "Historically, blacks have voted Republican, because they were the party of Lincoln, and we all know about that.",
        "Whereas all the Southern states, because the black vote was so negligible, Southern states voted for Democrats: Adlai Stevenson, John F.",
        "Kennedy.",
        "But it wasn't till Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act, Barry Goldwater voted against it, 1964, all those states voted Republican.",
        "And had Wallace not ran in '68, we assume - or certainly in 1972, all those states, from then on, voted Republican.",
        "Are you saying that race - the Civil Rights Act was just a coincidence, that the solid Democratic South suddenly became the solid Republican South?",
        "Well, only to an extent.",
        "I know academics are famous for saying yes and no, or on the one hand, on the other hand...",

        "Before and after.",
        "It is true that, in one sense, the timing of the '64 Civil Rights Act is a coincidence in the sense that by then, the solid South wasn't the solid South.",
        "By that time, by the time Lyndon Johnson ran against Goldwater, states like Florida and Tennessee and Texas and Virginia had either voted Republican three times in a row for president or come very close to doing so - Texas, by, I think, 45,000 votes...",
        "But the Deep South, the Alabamas and the...",
        "And Alabama, of course, they never - absolutely.",
        "But notice, there's one important difference distinction to be made here.",
        "I don't doubt for a second - as I said, that bigots - a lot of white Southern bigots ended up voting for Republican presidential candidates.",
        "But that has been used as a basis for inferring that, therefore, those Republican candidates and national conservatism gave them whatever they wanted in return for their votes.",
        "And I think that's where the error happens.",
        "There's no doubt in my mind that Wallace voters ended up voting for Richard Nixon, for example, in 1972.",
        "I just think when you look over Richard Nixon's record, he got them awfully cheap.",
        "He got them for awfully little.",
        "And, in fact, Kevin Phillips - at the time a Republican strategist - remarked in his famous, famous 1969 book, on \"\"The Emerging Republican Majority\"\", that you could get those Southern - those Deep South whites very cheaply, because no one was going to give them what they really wanted.",
        "But also to make the point, when Ronald Reagan announced his candidacy for president in 1980, he did it in a Mississippi city that was, I think, the capital - what...",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The capital of the Confederacy.",
        "Now, a lot of people have said that is not the kind of signal the Republican Party should be giving.",
        "What do you make of that signal?",
        "That one, I must admit, I find mystifying on both counts.",
        "I mean, Reagan had reason to want to win back the South from Jimmy Carter, his Southern opponent.",
        "On the other hand, there's something - and I don't doubt for a second that I would not have, in his shoes, gone into the Deep South and used phrase - state's rights in his speech.",
        "That said, he didn't kickoff his campaign there.",
        "It was his first appearance after the convention.",
        "He was already a national candidate by then.",
        "Secondly, he famously - I'm sorry.",
        "He not very famously went from that famous appearance to a meeting of - I think it was the Urban League in New York City, a civil rights organization.",
        "So it's an incongruous signal, at that.",
        "And I've never really understood - the critics of that speech or that appearance of Reagan's.",
        "They always bring this up in terms of the three civil rights workers slain in the 1960s, not far from where he made his remarks.",
        "Is the suggestion really that Ronald Reagan wanted to appeal to people who favored the murder of civil rights workers?",
        "Because that's a remarkably inflammatory image."

        "But Obama's pastor, somehow or another, is there are these racial implications that somehow another liberation theology is bad, and the conservatives use that to hammer him.",
