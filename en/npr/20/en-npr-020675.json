        "Here's an email from Steven in Indiana.",
        "Conservatives are not always racists, but many conservatives appeal to racism.",
        "Here in the second district of Indiana, Republican candidate Jackie Walorski has an ad against Democrat Joe Donnelly, attacking him for spending and showing a picture of Donnelly next to the picture of a black family.",
        "In other words, Joe Donnelly gives money to black people.",
        "Walorski may not be a racist, but she certainly appeals to racists.",
        "I have not seen that ad, and I'm not sure that Gerard Alexander, you have, either.",
        "But it's that implications sometimes that some people can be very sensitive to.",
        "Absolutely.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...it I remember someone, a colleague of mine at UVA, jokingly - it took a Harvard professor like Orlando Patterson to explain to us why it was racist.",
        "And he joked that if it took that level of scrutiny, it may be that we're reading an awful lot into things that they're more subtle than they should be.",
        "I think the emailer there is onto something very important, which is that ever since the 1970s and '80s, a great deal of imputation of racism has not been about overt speech or overt acts of discrimination, but rather has been about the hidden purpose that's understood to exist behind tax cutting and welfare reform and crackdowns on crime and other policies.",
        "And it is a devilishly difficult thing to prove or disprove claims of hidden purpose.",
        "And I have yet to find the tools that satisfy me as how some of these things should be interpreted objectively.",
        "Gerard Alexander, thanks very much for your time today.",
        "Gerard Alexander is the author of \"\"Conservatism Does Not Equal Racism.\"\" Again, there's a link to it on our website.",

        "He's an associate professor of politics at the University of Virginia.",
        "As far as princes not being able to choose their girlfriends, well, William and Harry have put a stop to that, because they most certainly did and have chosen their own girlfriends: Kate Middleton in the case of Prince William, and Chelsy Davy in the case of Prince Harry.",
        "We should also mention, on the subject of fact-checking campaign ads, NPR and politifact.com are working together this year on the Message Machine.",
        "We're truth-squadding what candidates and interest groups say in their ads.",
        "You can find more and see many of the ads at npr.org/themessagemachine, or you can just go to the Political Junkie and get Ken's take on the problem.",
        "Ken, thanks very much for your time."

        "And they - cable and satellite have a free-speech protection.",
        "So, the really big issue that the court may or may not grapple with is, is it time to rethink the First Amendment rules that allow strict regulation of broadcast, but free speech on cable?",

        "It was sort of their second argument.",

        "It was the government's case that this should be a blanket prohibition for broadcasters or they said, safe harbors during certain periods of the day?",
        "Could you give out warnings that would protect you, inoculate you against potential fines?",
