        "Yet the appeals court in New York that ruled on this, ruled on the side of the broadcasters.",
        "What was their argument?",
        "That the FCC had abruptly changed this policy, had not explained it.",
        "Just basically said, OK, now we're going to say a fleeting expletive gets you a fine.",
        "And they basically ruled on what you'd say is an administrative law grounds, that an agency can't just abruptly change its policy like that.",
        "It's sort of a half-step ruling.",
        "And now, the Supreme Court has to decide, are we going to consider this issue on the arbitrariness question, or are we going to deal with the First Amendment question?",
        "One more question on broadcasting and the next administration, David, and that regards what used to be known as the fairness doctrine.",
        "There are some in the Republican camp who feel that they - should President Obama take office, that a new Democratic administration will re-impose the fairness doctrine, which they say is a very nice-sounding word that broadcasters are required to be fair and evenhanded in their presentations.",
        "They say, however, it is an underhanded way to try to kill Republican right-wing radio.",
        "That's one of the fascinating issues in the background of this case that was not discussed today.",
        "But a lot of conservatives, Scalia is one of them, who very much objected to the fairness doctrine in the '80s on free speech grounds.",
        "A lot of conservatives did not like the fairness doctrine.",
        "They said free speech should prevail.",
        "Now, here's a case where social conservatives don't like indecency, and they're inclined to say, OK the government can regulate content.",
        "But I think somebody like Anthony Kennedy is going to say, wait a minute, if we go down that road, what if the Obama administration opposes the fairness doctrine?",
        "Are we going to allow government to regulate broadcast like that?",
        "So, I think it'll come up in the court's discussions.",
        "So, whether the government can control content, whether that is, in fact, the seven dirty words or in fact can impose a content - control content by re-imposing the fairness doctrine, that's going to form the background to a lot of this decision?",
        "Yes, I think that's right.",
        "I think a lot of the justices when they get to the - talk about this to say, look, if we say there's no real free- speech protection for broadcasters, we're opening the door to the FCC going back and imposing the fairness doctrine, and do we think that's a good idea?",
        "And of course, another background issue in the election today is - well, the composition of the court itself.",
        "There are several aging justices, several - particularly on the liberal side of the equation, and that's been part of the argument throughout.",
        "Yes, it's potentially very significant for the court.",
        "John Stevens is 88 years old, very sharp, very smart.",
        "He's not inclined to - I don't think he's anxious to leave two months from now.",
        "But you'd have to think the next president will replace him.",
        "The court is divided five-to-four on, as you know, a whole series of big issues: race, religion, abortion, the death penalty, gay rights, gun rights.",
        "If you switch one vote, you know, from liberal to conservative, it can make a very big deal.",
        "What word is it?",
        "David Savage of the Los Angeles Times, who covers the Supreme Court for that newspaper.",
        "He was kind enough to join us here today in 3A.",
