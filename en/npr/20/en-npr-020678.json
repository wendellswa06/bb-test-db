        "The wealth strikes me - the wealth that they sort of revel in really comes from the theft of resources from the developing world over centuries of the empire.",
        "I'm speaking particularly of the British Empire, but we could speak of other European countries, too.",
        "And I think they're an absurd an anachronism that really legitimizes a class-based society and terrible discrepancies of wealth and power.",
        "And I'd like to see an end to them all.",
        "Well, I...",
        "Well, first of all, I think everything that you have said - obviously, there is a fair amount of truth in it because you're talking about the whole of history.",
        "And the whole of history is a long chapter of murders, wars, and so on, and the rest of it - which I don't think can be laid all together, or largely, at the feet of the monarchy.",
        "And I have to say that the republics have a long history, and bloody history also.",
        "Also, I mean, I believe, there might even have been a civil war in your country.",
        "These aren't caused by monarchs, and I would say the corresponding: if you look at the modern world - and rather than the medieval one - the monarchies of the world, right across the world, tend to be the most stable and prosperous countries.",

        "And so, I don't really think that's a fair, sort of like, you know...",
        "Well, Dave, certainly those save criticisms could be leveled at the United States, which is - hasn't had a king since 1776.",
        "Quite.",
        "How did the United - what happened in 1898, how did the United States get hold of Cuba and the Philippines?",
        "Absolutely, I absolutely agree with you.",

        "Well, that was a republic...",

        "And I don't have any more time for the American empire than I do to the former British empire...",
        "I know, but you can't - I mean, the British - the great thing about the monarchy, or one of the great things is that it evolves and is an institution which is particularly adapted to evolve.",
        "Firstly, because the individual changes in character altogether.",
        "It's not just simply inherits it, that says, in a sense, luck.",
        "But that can be a very good system, and you -one can hardly say that the present queen is responsible for the slave trade and Elizabeth I's time, anymore than you or I are responsible for what went on in our ancestor's time.",
        "So, if we're talking about the monarchy today, we're talking about an institution, which, of course, is different in different countries, but which has adapted admirably.",
        "And in fact, in the more modern British monarchy, Queen Victoria - when Britain ruled half the globe - she herself, was notorious, was famously immune to any sort of color prejudice and, indeed, as far as a constitutional monarch she was permitted to do so, intervened on occasion in favor of people - and I've just been reading the other day when Edward VII was Prince of Wales and he traveled in India.",
        "He was horrified by instances he found of color prejudice on the part of the British in India, and protested very lively.",
        "So, I don't think this has got any - this has a lot to do with history, but…"

        "Now the line of succession has passed unbroken from male heir to male heir, but the current princes only have daughters.",
        "Why is this a crisis for some Japanese?",
        "Well, for traditionalists what defines Japan is the so-called unbroken Imperial line.",
        "Meaning that it's been passed down only through a male lineage.",
        "And traditionalists believe that if it passes down through a woman, then this feature that defines Japan ceases to exist, and it's a monumental disaster.",
