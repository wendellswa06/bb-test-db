        "So the defense, basically, is this guy died of a heart attack during a fairly severe interrogation, but the interrogation didn't actually cause his death.",
        "Well, the defense says he died of a heart attack.",
        "That it was accidental.",
        "He had an enlarged heart, it was a natural condition, and when he was put in the sleeping bag the stress caused him to have a heart attack.",

        "Well, the prosecution has rested.",
        "The defense will present more witnesses today.",
