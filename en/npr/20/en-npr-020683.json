        "So, I mean, I'm no big fan of war, but I think there has to be some military action taken by India with the help - with the support of the international community to teach Pakistan some kind of lesson.",

        "Were you guys aware of male haploidy?",
        "Well, yes, perhaps there are, but there are also a lot of people in India, including the government, who realize - who have told me that there're certain difficulties (Laughing) involved in a military action, namely swift retaliation, which will come very, very quickly to India, which is (Laughing) a lot closer than Cincinnati.",
        "So, people inside India stand to lose a lot.",
        "In addition, the Indian government, remember, after another heinous attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001, did mobilize troops on the border, kept them there for almost a year.",
        "There was a lot of talk and threat of a military conflict between India and Pakistan.",
        "And then that ended.",
        "You know, many Indian officials and strategic analysts point out that after that effort, India did not achieve what it had wanted to, which is an end to attacks on Indian soil that India believes originated from Pakistan.",
        "So, that effort at threatening war seven years ago has not yielded the Indian government what it has wanted.",
        "Somini Sengupta, thank you very much for your time.",
        "Thank you."

        "If somebody just watches Al-Manar, is there any truth there, or is it purely inflammatory propaganda?",
        "They have their own slant on things, but you know who is not slanted in the Middle East?",
        "I mean it's really it's really difficult to talk about the war of information or the propaganda war, you know.",
        "The United States also have Al- Hurra station operating there and, and people view Al-Hurra which means right out of Virginia.",

        "Iran also joins the mix, they have another station called Al-Haram, now BBC has Arabic, so you know, there is a whole sea of competition going on there and I would say every single station has its own agenda.",
