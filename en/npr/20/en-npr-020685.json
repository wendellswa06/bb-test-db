        "Electromagnetism is probably one of the four forces of nature that most people are most familiar with, maybe apart from gravity.",
        "But the strength of electromagnetism as measured by alpha seems to be different on one side of the sky and into deep space compared to the other side of the sky.",
        "So when we look in one direction, we find that it's stronger electromagnetism there, just a little bit.",
        "And then, when we look in the other direction, we see that it's weaker.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Well, what would that mean if you're correct and the constant changes?",
        "Well, the find - well, the constants of nature are assumed to be constant.",
        "We don't actually know for sure that they are constant - that they are actually constant throughout the universe.",
        "And that's why we're going and doing these measurements.",
        "We actually want to test that assumption.",
        "But if they're not constant throughout the universe, then it really means that - well, our current understanding of physics, our entire understanding of physics is really relying on those constants being constant, and that means that understanding is wrong.",
        "There's, probably, therefore, a more fundamental set of laws that we have to discover, and that's exciting.",
        "That's a great opportunity.",
        "It means that our conceptual idea of the universe will completely change.",
        "And it might be that there's something like string theory or M-theory or one of these what we call unification theories, something that unifies the four different forces of nature into just one theory or concept.",
        "Maybe one of those theories is correct.",
        "We don't know at this point.",
        "But they're the sort of implications we're - that we're talking about, here.",
