        "Well, so when we look in one part of the sky, as I say, we see a stronger value of alpha characterizing the strength of electromagnetism, and that's greater by about one - about 10 parts in a million on one side of the sky.",
        "And when we look to the other side of the sky, we see that it's weaker by about the same amount.",
        "And so we're not talking about large differences, here.",
        "But it doesn't matter how small the change is.",
        "If there's any change at all, it really means a revolution in physics is required - in our understanding of physics is required.",
        "You know, we've heard, in the last couple of weeks, two different revolutions in physics, possibly, first with the neutrino, right, going faster than the speed of light.",
        "That's right.",
        "Yes.",
        "And now your work that shows that the measuring of magnetism, electromagnetism is different in different parts of the sky.",
        "If this is true, I mean, are there any practical applications?",
        "Of course, people like to hear...",
        "Well, I think the main practical, you know, result of this is that our concept of the universe would completely change.",
        "So, for example, electromagnetism is what holds you together.",
        "It's what holds atoms together.",
        "And so everything around you is really governed by electromagnetism and also subject to gravity.",
        "But if you start playing around with the strength of electromagnetism, even just by a few percent, it would turn out that, for example, carbon atoms might become unstable and water molecules might fall apart.",
        "These are the sorts of consequences of changing the strength of that electromagnetic force.",
        "And so, for example, our life, obviously, depends - life as we know it depends on carbon and water.",
        "And so if you move into a universe, into a region of the universe where electromagnetism has a significantly different strength to here on Earth, then you might cease to exist.",
        "It might also mean that there's parts of the universe where life cannot exist - life, at least as we know it.",
        "So, if you like, we're in a Goldilocks zone of the universe, a Goldilocks - a very, very large Goldilocks zone, where the values of the fine-structure constant is just about right for us.",
        "Of course, we're probably tuned for the fine-structure constant rather than the fine-structure constant being tuned for us.",
        "Of course, we're going to find ourselves in a part of the universe where things are just right.",
        "But it might also mean that there's other regions of the universe where our sort of life just cannot exist.",
        "You know, it's more fascinating is that the more we're learning, the less we know, you know.",
        "Instead of thinking we're getting to know more about the universe, we're finding this dark energy that we don't know what it is.",
        "We're finding that maybe electromagnetism is not the same everywhere.",
        "It seems to be more - a more exciting, interesting place than just...",
        "I'd say it's more exciting and interesting.",
        "I don't know we're - I don't know if we're learning that we don't know as much as we did, or we thought we did.",
        "But the - it's certainly an exciting time in astronomy.",
        "One of the main reasons for that is that we can do these sorts of precise measurements.",
        "So we couldn't have done these with, you know, photographic detectors and things like that.",
        "The technology in astronomy and the size of our telescopes these days really enables us to do fundamental physics that we would otherwise do in the laboratory here on Earth.",
        "We can do that sort of physics in distant galaxies, and that's how we've done these measurements.",
        "And so you've - so other people will need to recheck this, and you'll probably be rechecking this yourself."

        "Well, we're certainly rechecking it ourselves and...",
        "Well, equipment's always advancing and technology's always advancing.",
        "We're certainly cross-checking this result in as many ways as we can find time to do by looking at - using the same method and using the same sort of instruments.",
        "Those instruments are getting better.",
        "There's also new instruments being designed and starting to be built now for existing telescopes.",
        "And, of course, we all look forward to the new era of the extremely large telescope - not very large telescopes, but extremely large telescopes, 30-meter and 40-meter telescopes that will be able to really nail this question with very highly stable spectrographs that can look at these distinct galaxies in a lot more detail.",
        "But I think if you're to believe these results, finally, if what we find in further experiments confirms what we've already found, then I think that the endgame of this is that you really have to confirm this somehow in the laboratory.",
        "And there are hopes for that, using very, very precise atomic clock experiments.",
        "And these things might be able to detect different values of alpha just in our solar system.",
        "As we go around the sun, we might experience a different strength of electromagnetism in the laboratory.",
        "And we just have to have precise enough measurement to find that.",
        "But we don't know yet.",
        "But you'd then need an explanation for it, too.",
        "Oh, you absolutely would, and that's the exciting part.",
        "You know, the explanations have to meet the observations, and currently, our current theories cannot explain this.",
        "Actually, our current theories can't even explain why the values of the - the value of the fine-structure constant is what it is.",
        "We have no idea where this number comes from.",

        "We just don't know where this number comes from.",
        "And if it started to vary, we wouldn't have an explanation for that, either.",
        "But it would point the way, I think, to a new understanding, or the start of a new understanding of more fundamental laws of physics that we just don't have any idea about right now.",

        "The new loan would then be used to partially pay off that original mortgage.",
        "And the original lender would, of course, be taking a loss, but in exchange they'd get a so-called negative equity certificate.",
        "If the homeowner sells the house down the road at a higher value, that certificate would entitle the lender to a share of the profit.",

        "Jared Seeberg(ph) is a financial services policy analyst with the Stanford Group, and he says a frequent criticism of other bail-out plans we've seen is that, you know, let's say the housing market recovers, what's to stop the borrower who got bailed out from turning around and selling the house at a profit?",
        "And this addresses one of those unknowns by saying that the lender would get to participate in the upside through the holding of this certificate.",
