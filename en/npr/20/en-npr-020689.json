        "OK.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's get down to puzzle business.",
        "Remind me, what was last week's challenge?",
        "Yes.",
        "I said name two animals, both mammals, one of them domestic, the other wild.",
        "I said put their letters together, and rearrange the result to name another mammal, this one wild and not seen naturally around North America.",
        "What mammal is it?",
        "Well, the domestic one is the dog.",
        "The wild one is the gnu - G-N-U.",
        "And you put those letters together, and you get the dugong - D-U-G-O-N-G.",
        "Did you know a dugong?",
        "No, no.",
        "Well, it's a large plant-eating mammal off the coast of Australia sometimes called a sea cow related to the manatee.",
        "Sea cow I know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But a dugong.",
        "There you go.",
        "It's status is listed as threatened so it's a good thing to know about.",
        "But save the dugong doesn't really, like, roll off the tongue for a bumper sticker, I suppose.",

        "Yeah.",
        "We could start something.",

        "His father was born in Pakistan and owns a fish-and-chips shop.",
        "And the second one was a 19-year-old.",
        "His name's Hasib Hussain, and it was his disappearance on the day of the attacks which provided one of the vital clues which led police to Leeds.",
        "He was reported missing by his mother at about 10:00 at night on Thursday.",
        "The third man is called Mohammed Sadique Khan.",
        "Now he comes from Dewsbury, a town outside Leeds.",
        "He's a 30-year-old man of Pakistani origin.",
        "He was married to a lady called Hasena(ph) and they had a baby girl approximately around eight months old.",
        "And what about the fourth suspect?",
        "Any word on him?",
        "Well, all we know about the fourth suspect so far is that he also comes from the same area, from West Yorkshire, but in terms of a name and who he is so far, we don't know that information yet.",
        "There are talk of three of these bombers being British-born and one of them is possibly not British-born.",

        "Yes.",
        "We've been speaking to the uncle of Shahzad Tanweer, the 23-year-old.",
        "His uncle, Bashir Amed, told us about his nephew and said that he'd been religious for some time, but he'd never talked about paradise, that he thought he was going to London last Thursday for some religious event and they thought he'd been a victim in the terrorist attack.",
        "Apparently all say he went to Pakistan for a period of time.",
        "He'd also been to Afghanistan, but he thought that when he went to Pakistan, it was just to improve his reading of the Koran.",
        "And he just says they're in total shock.",
        "The family's in total shock.",

        "They went to four houses.",
        "The first house was in an area of Leeds called Beeston, just a normal terrace, three floors with some conifers in front, window baskets.",
        "It looks--totally ordinary house.",
        "And then later on in the morning about 11:30 yesterday morning, police came to the area which I'm in now in Burley and they cordoned off a house here, carried out a controlled explosion.",
        "This area here is where they think the bombs were made.",
        "When you say this is an ordinary neighborhood, is it socially isolated from the rest of Leeds, or are people just leading completely ordinary lives here and it turns out there's a bomb factory next door?",
        "Well, Leeds is a very multicultural city where Muslims and Hindus and British-born people all live together.",
        "And so they're very surprised that the terrorists have come from their areas of Leeds.",
        "I wonder if they aren't concerned, that is that maybe there's going to be some kind of backlash directed against their neighborhood.",
        "They were very concerned about backlash.",
        "They were very concerned that Muslims might be attacked.",
        "There have been a number of attacks on mosques around Britain, already one in the neighboring city of Bradford and one in Leeds itself where just minor attacks, but there are fears that this could lead to more, especially now we know that these men who committed the crimes in London were suicide bombers.",

        "Yes.",
        "I said name a famous American singer, one who's living, six letters in the first name, six letters in the last.",

        "Who is it?",

        "What was the answer?",
        "The answer is Willie Nelson, and remove those middle letters, you get Wilson, as in Woodrow Wilson.",
