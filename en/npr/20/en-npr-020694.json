        "So we've been tracking this for a long time at Latino Decisions.",
        "Over half of the Latino eligible voting population here in New Mexico who say they know somebody who is undocumented personally, either a member of their family or a friend - you know, those kinds of statements - it's not about policy to them.",
        "I think it's personal.",
        "And it touches on this general trend that a lot of Latinos we see don't necessarily think about immigration politics and policy as their forefront issue.",
        "But when they think about it as challenging their identity and who they are, it really motivates them, you know, to not only vote, but take a closer look at not only Trump, but the overall Republican Party.",
        "Now, I gather New Mexico's Republican governor, Susana Martinez - she condemned Donald Trump over those comments about Mexican immigrants.",
