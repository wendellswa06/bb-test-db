        "Up next - I promised you a third story, and this is a whale of a story.",
        "It's a whale of a birth.",
        "Paleontologists in Pakistan have found the fossilized remains of an early whale species, an ancestor to the whales we have around today.",
        "And it turns out that one of the proto-whales was expecting.",
        "She was pregnant, with child.",
        "Inside the female skeleton was a full-term fetus.",
        "And even more surprising, the mother whale was set to give birth to a baby that would be born head first.",
        "Now, you say, OK that happens.",
        "But in this situation, that means that this early whale was giving birth on land, not in the ocean, not at sea.",
        "The whale was giving birth on land, and whales it seems have done the evolutionary opposite of fish.",
        "They have moved from land to water over evolutionary time.",
        "A male species was also found, and that give scientists some valuable information about how males may have competed for females.",
        "Joining me now to talk more about this is Philip Gingerich, and he's professor of geological sciences and director of the Museum of Paleontology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.",
        "Thank you for being with us today, Dr. Gingerich.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "So, you found these fossils, and the mother was going to give birth on land?",
        "Well, the mother was going to give birth head first, and that's the pattern of all land mammals.",
        "Whales give birth tail first.",
        "So, on the face of it, it looks like she should give birth on land.",
        "Now, that's not so implausible, because the whale in question is still semi-aquatic, it's still amphibious.",
        "They still came out on land for some reason.",
        "We haven't known what the reason is, but this is certainly, I would say, what we expected, though we didn't have evidence for it before.",
        "So, the whale in its evolution originated as a land mammal, and then it evolved to leave the land to live in the ocean.",
        "And now, we're looking at a sort of spot in its evolution where it still came back to land to give birth.",
        "We're looking at the transition back to the ocean.",
        "Back to the ocean.",
        "And is this the first time anybody has found a fossil like this?",
        "Well, it's the first time anyone's found a fossil with - a fossil whale with a calf inside.",
        "Yeah."

        "We have a lot of whales spanning the transition, so that it's becoming more and more understandable how and when and where whales did this, but the whole life history side of it, having to do with birth and development, we knew nothing about.",
        "You know, when you look at the pictures of the site where the archeologists dug this fossil up - it's a dry, barren spot.",
        "How did you know where to look?",
        "Well, of course we didn't at first.",
        "And, it's an interesting story.",
        "I started working in that region in the 1970s and ran away because everything was marine, and I was looking for land mammals.",
        "And then, slowly, through a long history of discovery that had a decade in Egypt, I realized, that's the place to look for walking whales or semi-aquatic whales, transitional whales that are more primitive than the ones we found in Egypt.",
        "And what was it like - difficulty - working in Pakistan?",
        "Well, Pakistan is Pakistan.",
        "And you do things a little differently there.",

        "It's not a great place to work now.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Can you - let's talk about the fetus - the unborn whale that was found inside this whale that was ready to give birth.",
        "Can you learn anything more about these whales by looking at the skeleton?",
        "A long process to find them and clean them and study them and write about them.",
        "So, we'll just have to keep our…",
        "But yes, there are things in the pipeline.",
        "And we'll also have somebody with a military viewpoint on this.",
        "Retired General Joseph Hoar, former commander in chief of the United States Central Command, who's with us by phone from Del Mar, California.",

        "Thank you.",
        "And, John Yoo, what do you mean when you say Congress shouldn't micromanage the executive branch?",
        "Well, I think it goes to the very root of why we have an executive in the first place.",
        "And the idea was that legislatures are good at passing, you know, broad laws with policy choices made in them.",
        "But that legislature, particularly as big as one as our Congress, can't be there to oversee the day-to-day implementation of policy.",
        "And that the reason we have an executive branch in part is not just to execute the laws but to also to respond to events and challenges that the laws couldn't anticipate when they were passed.",
        "A good example of this might be the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which was passed in 1978 in response to President Nixon and Watergate and his abuse of national security powers to wiretap his political enemies.",
        "The FISA law, though, wasn't really apt for the new world of terrorism and for the new technologies that terrorists used against us on 9/11.",
        "And so in those kinds of situations, and wartime is really the one where you see this the greatest, president's powers expand to try to adapt our country's policies and to react to those kinds of emergencies and challenges.",
        "And in an emergency I guess I could see your point, but obviously the FISA law was adapted to a certain situation.",
        "There's been a long time now, five years, for Congress to write a new law for a new situation.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think the problem that we have, at least with the FISA situation, is that what the government did, this NSA program of trying to wiretap communications into and out of the United States involving terrorists.",
        "And, you know, to be frank, I worked on that program when I was in the government, according to people like The New York Times news pages.",
        "You're not denying their accuracy.",
        "I'm not denying it.",
        "I mean they were good enough to publish my op-ed.",
        "So I think that, you know, there you have a situation where we had this new challenge, the president tried to respond because there was a gap in FISA.",
        "And the problem was there was a danger to losing the advantage that our NSA operators had if the president went to Congress and sought a law that would be public.",
        "And in justifying the law, you'd have to make public exactly what things the government was doing that needed new authorization.",
        "And so I think that's a real tension that confronts the government.",
        "We're - you know, this kind of war relies a lot more on intelligence and information and covert activity than previous wars, and so, you know, we have to be conscious that while we do want to have a full and open debate, we also want to try to protect those secrets that are allowing us to effectively fight."

        "And we get back to the Geneva Conventions.",
        "In the recent Hamdan decision, the United States Supreme Court said the president has to go to Congress to get this authorization if he wants to continue this interrogation.",
        "This is sort of the interesting thing about the Hamdan case.",
        "It has been read as a rebuke to the president and the president's military commissions and the fact that the military commissions don't comply with the Geneva Conventions.",
        "But if you read it closely, it's very careful to skirt around the issue of the president's power and really directs most of its attention to Congress and says, you know, Congress's laws require this, and if Congress wants to update those laws or pass a new law authorizing these military commissions, it should and that - you know, four of the justices in fact say if, you know, the Congress does this, military commissions will be fine.",
        "The other thing that I thought that was remarkable is that the courts are getting involved, in a way, during wartime in a way they hadn't been, so - that's really, I think, the real story.",
        "So I think some of the story that we read about is, oh, the president's trying to expand his power, and I don't think that's quite right, at least in wartime.",
        "You know, I think President Bush's power is being used more greatly is a way other presidents have used their powers more greatly in war, but the unusual thing in this war that hadn't happened before is that the courts have intervened and become much more active while hostilities were going on than they ever had been in the past.",
        "General Hoar, in your view, should the United States attempt to rewrite its belief of what Article 3 of the Geneva Convention says?",
        "No, I don't think so at all, and I think that John Yoo's characterization of what's going on in Washington is - an attempt on the part of the Congress to micromanage - is completely off base.",
        "This is an extraordinarily important decision, and it's important for three important reasons, I believe.",
        "First of all, we are endangering the lives of American servicemen and women who are in uniform and are serving in combat zones or in dangerous areas.",
        "We can't expect our own people to be treated under the provisions of the Geneva Convention as written unless we offer the same sort of procedural protections for people that are acting as our enemies.",
        "What about the argument that you hear a lot: al-Qaida pays no attention to the Geneva Convention.",
        "Well, thank you very much.",
        "That's the second point.",
        "This is really not about al-Qaida, it's about us.",
        "It's about the American people and what we stand for.",
        "And there was a lot of talk 20 years ago about the United States being the city on the hill, and in my own travels, particularly in the Middle East, this is still true.",
        "So many people look to the United States as a beacon of democracy, as a place that most of them would like to live.",
        "When they have problems with the United States, it's not about us as Americans, it's about our policies.",

        "But this issue is not about al-Qaida.",
        "It is about who we are as Americans.",
        "And with respect to that, when we look at the ongoing problems in the world, I think that Colin Powell had it absolutely right that this is a war of perceptions, and we have people - after Abu Ghraib and the stories coming out of Guantanamo Bay, that we've not done a very good job in terms of how we've dealt with people that have come into our custody.",
        "And John Yoo, I wonder how you reply to the views of General Powell and General Hoar and Senator McCain, who as you know was a long-time prisoner in North Korea, who's saying, look, it's not about this conflict, it's about all the future conflicts.",
        "First, can I just make a brief point about the micromanagement?",
        "Please.",
        "It's just that, you know, we've had wars before where we've had military commissions, and President Roosevelt created them in World War II.",
        "Congress never passed a law like this or even proposed one, to try to set out a detailed code of procedure for military commissions.",
        "This is unprecedented, that it would pass a law like this or consider it.",
        "It usually left it up to the president to do.",
        "It would pass - there is a law on the books that just says we recognize the practice of having military commissions.",
        "So I think it is unprecedented that Congress would consider doing this, and it is a little micromanagement in the sense that previous presidents in wartime had much more flexibility.",
        "As to the claim about this policy argument, I think one thing to build on your question, is that this claim of reciprocity I don't think works with terrorists, an example of trying to fit this new circumstance with terrorism into the old paradigm of war between nation-states.",
        "From everything we know, al-Qaida and its allies have no interest in following the laws of war.",
        "In fact, the reason they're so effective is because they violate the laws of war, and so there's not much likelihood of reciprocity, and I didn't hear the general try to defend that statement.",
        "No, he said it's not about them, it's about us.",
        "Right, it's not about - so the first thing he said to you was about reciprocity, getting our people treated well, but then I think you have to acknowledge in reality they are not treated well.",
        "Even in wars where we do follow the Geneva Conventions, our officers and troops often get mistreated, at least since World War II.",
        "Is that an argument to reject the Geneva Conventions entirely?",
        "I'm not saying we should reject it.",
        "I think traditionally what's happened is that presidents should try to develop rules that we will use with terrorists, because I think it's fair to say that this new phenomenon of an enemy like al-Qaida is not something that people who wrote the Geneva Conventions ever could thought of in 1949, and so what we're really trying to do is figure out new rules that would apply that take into account the principles of the Geneva Convention but are drafted towards advancing against this new kind of enemy."
