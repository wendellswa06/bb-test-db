        "In terms of the costs and benefits abroad, you know, I don't really think it's good to argue in such absolute terms, like we should always apply the Geneva Conventions regardless, because I think it doesn't take account of the cost.",
        "So the president, you know, gave a speech last week detailing the actionable intelligence that our CIA was able to get from people like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and so on to prevent attacks on the United States.",
        "That's a benefit of not applying the Geneva Conventions where they don't need to be to terrorists, and that's going to be a cost if we follow this idea: well, we have to follow the Geneva Conventions entirely in this new situation.",
        "You have to ask yourself, is it worth it to give up all that intelligence that the president outlined in his speech that we were able to get and that would stop those attacks?",
        "So I think, you know, these are things we have to weigh and balance against each other.",
        "I don't think there's an obvious, absolute right answer.",
        "Just one quick question and then we'll get some listeners on the line.",
        "The Geneva Conventions - reciprocity was not an issue in the Korean War, or for that matter in the Vietnam War, in which John McCain fought and stayed as a prisoner for five years.",
        "Nevertheless, the United States obeyed, for its part, the Geneva Conventions and thought it was important to sustain the moral high ground.",
        "I do think that there may be good policy reasons to follow it.",
        "I'm not saying that - I would say that they legally weren't required to, but I think there may be very good policy reasons to.",
        "For example, you know, if you follow the Geneva Conventions voluntarily it may encourage the other side to surrender at a higher rate, if they know we're going to treat them well.",
        "But I think we have to weigh the costs and benefits, too.",
        "There are also costs to following that policy if it means that that the CIA can't use coercive interrogation methods against al-Qaida leaders.",
        "You're listening to the Opinion Page on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Our guests are John Yoo, a professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley.",
        "Retired General Joseph Hoar, former commander in chief at the United States Central Command, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And let's get a caller on the line.",
        "Excuse me, I hit the wrong button.",
        "This is Perry.",
        "Perry's calling us from Plattsburg, New York.",
        "Yes, hello there.",
        "This is Perry Walker, and I would like for them to stay with the Geneva Conventions, what we have now.",
        "You can see that that is the standard we've set, and I think we ought to stay there.",
        "There are ramifications when you start changing that, even in police tactics, when they go to interrogating, you know, people that have committed crimes and so forth.",
        "They'll give you any story you want to hear as long as you, you know, quit torturing them.",
        "You don't get - the Stockholm syndrome.",
        "I'd like to make them more - although you don't really want to be friends with these guys, we've seen with the Stockholm syndrome that they begin to feel a part of you when you treat them right, over a long period of time.",
        "Can we get a response from you, General Hoar?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "OK.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think Perry is absolutely right.",
        "I chaired a conference on this subject in December in Washington, D.C., and we had a very broad group of people there, including Israeli and people that were informed about the British tactics.",
        "And both Israel and the United Kingdom had chosen to walk away from terror because - from torture - because they found that it didn't work.",
        "And I think it's quite interesting that rather than intimidation and torture, that working with people over time to gain their confidence appeared to work in both Northern Ireland and in dealing with Palestinians.",
        "John Yoo, a lot of people say you may get information from torture or aggressive questioning.",
        "It may not be accurate.",
        "Well, obviously if we could get the information in ways that didn't involve coercion, that would be the best for everyone.",
        "I do think, though, that if you look at the situation of people like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed or Ramzi Binalshibh or Abu Zubeida, these are people we now know were trained to resist standard interrogation and were not producing any information.",
        "Also, in terms of the Israeli experience, the Israelis did use coercive interrogation methods.",
        "They don't torture people, but they use methods designed to interrogate coercively, and they have reported to places like the United Nations that this has produced information that could not be received in any other way, that have prevented scores of terrorist attacks.",
        "So I do think that, you know, I'm not an expert, but I do think that states have said that these work in certain kinds of situations.",
        "I think the problem is, do we want to take that option completely off the table?",
        "Are we so comfortable in the way that we're dealing with the terrorist threat that if we were to capture another Khalid Shaikh Mohammed or Abu Zubeida, we are comfortable saying, we're not going to use any coercive interrogation methods at all, that we will only try to use methods no more vigorous than good cop/bad cop no matter what kind of information they might have.",
        "Perry, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you so much, and I just think this idea of the Stockholm syndrome is very important, that you'll get more information from those people - from anybody.",
        "We've had conflicts before and very strange, you know, awful things, but the Geneva Convention has worked before, and it's been the standard.",
        "I think we need to hold that standard.",

        "Yes, I had to call in on this after Attorney General Gonzales's comment today that aspects of the Geneva Convention they were finding confusing, and you know, we've been working under the Geneva Convention for what, 60 years now, and they found it, you know - they were able to interpret it fairly well during the Cold War, Vietnam and all the other conflicts we've been involved in since World War II.",
        "General Hoar, as a military man, did you find the Geneva Conventions confusing?",
        "No, I don't think so at all, and I think that the men that were fighting in the front lines didn't find it confusing.",
        "It doesn't mean that there weren't abuses.",
        "But the question is that if you have a clear policy, as I think you have right now, and you enforce it, and you keep the troops well-informed about what they may do and what they can't do, and similarly for interrogators and people that are running prisoner-of-war camps and places like Guantanamo, I think that you would not have the abuses that have appeared in Abu Ghraib and apparently in Guantanamo Bay as well, and you wouldn't have the terrible public relations problem that has been created by abuse of prisoners.",

        "Cubans on the island and here in the United States are working through their emotions about the late dictator, among them writer Achy Obejas.",

        "It's just one line in the piece.",
        "But what I mean is that those of us who have spent our entire lives with Fidel as a powerful backdrop, let's say, have, in some ways, sometimes absorbed some of his, you know, if not attitudes, sometimes peculiarities or affects.",
        "For example, my dad used to point in the air in the exact same way as Fidel.",

        "They're pointing, you know, and it's not a natural thing.",
        "It's like we've picked it up, you know?",
        "So the imperiousness that sometimes afflicts us becomes the little Fidel in us.",
        "So your father gestures like him, but - but you write that your father hated him with singular fury, as you put it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, forced him into exile, loathed him, but you said there was a smidgeon of admiration from your father and even identification.",
        "I mean, make sense of all of that.",
        "Well, the interesting thing about the skull of the fetus - the rest of the skeleton is not well-mineralized.",
        "And so, the rest of it is not so well-preserved.",
        "We can identify the middle sections of the long bones, but the ends aren't preserved.",
        "They were cartilaginous no doubt and aren't mineralized.",
        "From the skull though, we can see that it's full of baby teeth.",
        "And once we went through and carefully identified what all the baby teeth are - and some of them are landmarks that help us know where we are in the dentition - we realized that the first molars are already forming.",
        "Now, this is a near-term fetus.",
        "It's about to be born.",
        "It isn't born yet, it's still in the mother, and it's already got first molars about halfway formed.",
        "So, that tells us that the animal was what we call precocial in development.",
        "It was going to be born ready to move, ready to eat solid food.",
        "And that's a characteristic of mammals that live in a semi-aquatic setting.",
        "It's characteristic of whales today.",
        "Probably, you have to be precocial to make the transition."

        "Talking to Philip Gingerich, professor of geological sciences at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor on Science Friday from NPR News.",
        "It almost sounds like - so, you're describing a transitory kind of birth where it's ready to jump almost back into the water as soon as it's born?",
        "Well, I think it will be born near the water.",
        "And I'm sure it would be in the water within days, if not hours.",
        "And how far along would take - evolutionary-wise speaking - to become a full whale as we know it today?",
        "Well, we get what we recognize as modern whales - baleen whales, toothed whales - about 10 million years after this one.",
        "So, interestingly, I would've thought the transition would be over in a minute, and as paleontologists we would never see it, never find fossils to be able to study it.",
        "And exactly the opposite is true.",
        "The whole transition took about 15, 20 million years and we're getting, I hope, every step of it.",
        "Now, the fact that you found a male whale also, does that add to your knowledge?",
        "Well, yes.",
        "Taking a step backward, when we find a whale with a calf inside, with a fetus inside, we suddenly know she's female.",
        "And this is the first time in the Eocene that we can sex - it might be the first time in the fossil history of whales that we can sex a whale definitely, definitively.",
        "So, knowing that the mother is female, we had another skeleton of the same species that's about 12 percent larger with canine teeth - if you know what those are, they're in the corners of your mouth in front…",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "About 20 percent larger in the second specimen.",
        "So, it's easy to imagine that that's a male.",
        "It's easy to interpret the larger one with a little larger canine teeth as a male.",
        "And the canine teeth are different enough that I think I can reliably sex quite a few of the individuals that we've had before for which we didn't know the sex.",
        "And, how do you know what this just was not a breach birth of a whale?",
        "Well, we have a sample of one."
