        "There's a historical reference there.",
        "That's the - there's actually a political history behind that phrase, you won't have me to kick around anymore.",

        "He ran for president in 1968 and reporters got to kick him around a lot more during the Watergate scandal a few years after that.",
        "Indeed - stayed on the political stage much longer than anyone had expected, much like Fidel Castro",
        "This is the day in 1954 that the Supreme Court issued its famous ruling desegregating schools, Brown versus Board of Education.",
        "Today, schools remain largely segregated, and the author Richard Rothstein argues that's because housing is segregated.",

        "Thank you very much.",
        "So the basic argument of your book is that while racist individuals might have contributed to housing segregation in specific cases, there was an overwhelming amount of government policy at the state, local and federal level that explicitly forced black people to live in different places from white people.",
        "And I have to admit that reading this book, the geographic scope, the longevity, the sheer creativity of these policies really took me by surprise.",
        "It takes many people by surprise.",
        "This whole history has been forgotten.",
        "It used to be well-known.",

        "One was the first civilian public housing program which frequently demolished integrated neighborhoods in order to create segregated public housing.",

        "Companies, just - I am not plugging any company in particular, but I got a start with a company and my advice would be this: Go to a community college, see if they have a class that they can either teach you or recommend, and if they don't have that then, you can go to one of the big national companies that's really legitimate.",
        "You can go through their training class.",

        "After a year, you're off the hook; you've paid for your education.",
