        "So, for those at the lower end of the salary range, in the entry-level jobs, things are a little bit brighter, but in comparison, I think they're struggling and feeling a bit frustrated right now.",

        "But going through your college, they have access not only to the companies that recruit on campus - and some industries are definitely recruiting; accounting for one, is still heavily recruiting on college campuses - but they also get access to some of the positions at small- to medium-sized companies from alumni, from local companies, that wouldn't necessarily be listed on a national job site or in a newspaper, but they would go through universities to try to find qualified entry-level candidates.",

        "Ivy League, yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I just started seeing all these trends, and it was just getting kind of scary living in the city.",
