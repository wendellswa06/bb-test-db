        "I guess the way to start a good story is to start where it gets interesting, and for me that was the crux of the story.",

        "I was a momma's boy.",

        "He was born in 1895.",
        "To set this story - as Karel grows up, there are two rival families in town: the Skalas and the Villasenors.",
        "Yes.",
        "What pits against each other?",
        "Well, I think we have two strong-willed patriarchs, one who's in effect trying to build an empire.",
        "He's fleeing the unrest thats beginning in 1910 with civil unrest, civil revolution effectively, in Mexico, trying to escape with some of his wealth intact.",
        "He comes looking for - and has daughters - he comes looking to form an allegiance and to marry the strongest, wealthiest family in the particular county that he's set his eye on.",
        "Pit against him is a relatively hard, sort of old-fashion Czech patriarch, Vaclav Skala.",
        "And he - while he's interested in increasing his land holdings, he tends to do it by betting with his neighbors and gambling horse races - or gambling on horse races, to take some of the acreage away from his neighbors and bring it under his fold of his growing sort of property holdings.",
        "This book, sentence by sentence, betrays a love of Texas hill country.",
        "And I guess I was surprised to finish it and turn to the publisher's information and find out that you're a city kid from Houston."

        "The FHA policies here were not merely incentives or encouragements.",
        "You tell the story of progressive, idealistic developers who wanted to build integrated housing communities and were absolutely unable to do so.",
        "And we're not just talking about in the Deep South here.",

        "The great American novelist Wallace Stegner got a job right after World War II at Stanford University.",
        "There was an enormous civilian housing shortage.",
        "He joined and helped to lead a co-operative of 400 families who bought a large tract outside Stanford University where they wanted to build single-family homes.",
        "The FHA refused to insure those homes refused to provide the capital for construction because the 400-member co-operative had three African-American members.",
        "The co-operative tried to resist the FHA's demand, promising the FHA that the number of African-Americans in the co-operative wouldn't exceed the percentage of African-Americans in California as a whole.",
        "The FHA refused that compromise.",
        "Finally, the co-operative had to disband because they couldn't go ahead with the project.",
        "They sold the land to a private developer, who with FHA guarantees built single family homes with racially exclusive deeds.",
        "Your book also explains one way in which black neighborhoods became undesirable.",
        "You described zoning laws in which black parts of town were officially zoned for industrial plants, waste disposal, other things that we would consider a blight.",
        "And meanwhile, those businesses were explicitly kept out of white neighborhoods in the same cities.",
        "Yes, there are examples in St. Louis and Los Angeles, neighborhoods that once they had African-American residents were rezoned to permit industrial and toxic uses.",
        "Those rezonings turned those neighborhoods into slums.",
        "White families outside those neighborhoods looked upon the neighborhoods, saw slums and concluded that African-Americans were slum dwellers and that if they moved into their neighborhoods, into the white neighborhoods, they would bring those conditions with them.",
        "Why were all of these policies put in place?",
        "Was it just overt racism on the part of policy makers?",
        "What actually was the motivation?",
        "Well, that's very hard to know.",
        "And one thing that should be remembered is that it can't be blamed simply on the standards of the time because there were people who dissented.",
        "People did know better, but they had other priorities.",
        "And they caved in to private prejudice and some of their constituents.",
        "They themselves were prejudiced.",
        "It was assumptions about racial superiority, but it also was cowardice in not confronting popular views about racial superiority."

        "So as you lay out this history, these segregationist, discriminatory, harmful structures were built over the first half of the 20th century, and then Congress passes the Fair Housing Act in 1968 which says many of those practices were illegal, unconstitutional and they stop - for the most part, the worst ones.",
        "Why doesn't that solve the problem?",
        "Well, because all the Fair Housing Act could do was prohibit future discrimination.",
        "But by the time the Fair Housing Act was passed, the patterns of segregation had been firmly established.",
        "Simply passing a Fair Housing Act did not enable African-Americans who were previously living in urban areas to relocate to the suburbs from which they'd been excluded.",
        "I gave the example earlier of Levittown in 1947-48, when those homes were built with a racially restrictive policy.",
        "Those homes sold for about $8,000 a piece or $100,000 more or less in today's currency.",
        "African-Americans, working class families could have bought those homes.",
        "Today though, those homes sell for $300,000, $400,000.",
        "They're no longer affordable to working class families.",
        "In the ensuing two generations, the white families who moved into those homes gained that $200,000, $300,000 in equity appreciation.",
        "African-Americans living in rented apartments, prohibited from moving to the suburbs, gained none of that appreciation.",
        "The result is that today nationwide, African-American incomes on average are about 60 percent of white incomes, but African-American wealth is about 5 to 7 percent of white wealth.",
        "That enormous difference is almost entirely attributable to unconstitutional federal housing policy practiced in the mid-20th century.",
        "The current secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Ben Carson, has criticized what he calls social engineering programs that are meant to help black homeowners or renters.",
        "It sounds as though you're arguing that the first two-thirds of the 20th century were social engineering to harm black people in homeownership and that maybe it will require some social engineering to undo that harm.",
        "Yes.",
        "What I tell Secretary Carson is that the reforms that he's criticizing are an attempt to undo social engineering.",
        "Clearly he's right that when you try to engineer social policy the way that is necessary to reverse segregation, there are some unintended consequences.",
        "There will be prices to be paid, but those prices are small compared to the costs of the social engineering that was conducted in the first two-thirds of the 20th century by the federal government.",
        "And that's a price that we have to pay to rectify a serious constitutional violation.",

        "And I found myself, you know, the outsider in what should feel like my homeland.",
        "And thats what has always sort of drawn it to me - or drawn me to it, rather.",
