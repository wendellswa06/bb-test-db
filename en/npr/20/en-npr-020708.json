        "I did conveyor belting work, started off in the warehouse, did sales, I worked on an oil rig, I was a medical courier.",
        "And you get to speak with just such a wonderful cross-section of people, and maybe that helps more than anything in dialogue.",
        "But it also gives you something to really be curious about that has a human root to it, that's not some idea.",
        "And how do you convince someone to buy a conveyor belt?",

        "The 33 men pulled up from the depths of Chile's San Jose mine this week looked strong and proud: victors, not victims.",
        "Their survival was a marvel that enlisted drillers, engineers, doctors, geologists, scientists, psychiatrists, bureaucrats, clergy, and volunteers from around the world.",
        "But the men saved themselves too.",
        "They had the hard, hidden part: living with isolation, hunger and despair for 69 days, trapped in a small, dark space 2,000 feet below the ground that tried to crush them.",
        "They told reporters yesterday the first 17 days were hardest.",

        "President Pi�era says he also knows that this magnificent achievement stemmed from what may be reckless disregard of mine safety.",
        "Never again, he says, will we permit people to work in conditions so unsafe and inhuman as they worked in the San Jose mine.",
        "It's tempting to say the rescue of the miners, like the landing on the moon, or the return of Apollo 13, shows that humans can do anything if we just work together.",
        "Landing on the moon, or rescuing 33 miners, are daunting but direct enterprises.",
        "They have start points and finish lines.",
