        "I think that everyone is a lot more aware of the casualties in Iraq.",

        "You know, I think, in a way, this country has a very abstract view of the war.",

        "I think one of my very first impressions was that all of a sudden, it seemed like there is this fear being spread throughout the nation, whether it's from the TV or just media in general.",
        "But what I sense as I came home and I found an intense amount of security and just so safe.",

        "Well, I think prior to going, I - prior to going, I definitely was writing about happy thoughts.",
        "And then, right before I was - right when I was getting ready to deploy, suddenly I was having trouble writing and I realized I wasn't in the right state.",
        "And so I started - I found I was writing about being afraid.",
        "And then, I was over there and I was writing about Iraqis.",

        "I mean, that was - that was actually pretty early in our deployment.",
        "We had been - We've been Kuwait a month, and then we are in Iraq only for a month and it was - we were staying at an old Iraqi air force base.",
        "So there was nothing there.",
        "And - I mean, we are washing our hair in the bucket, looking at the dirt ground or, you know, porta-potties weren't - they didn't even have chemicals in the porta-potties, yet for us, so there are some holes being dug.",
        "And so you just look out and all you see is dirt.",
        "We hadn't reached the city yet, we are still in basically the undeveloped parts of Iraq, so you just felt like you are in this huge sandbox, and what are we doing here.",

        "You're here, you don't know why, you don't necessarily feel support from home, like where is the praise for even being here in a sense.",

        "Just a couple of those acronyms, IED, improvised explosive device, a roadside bomb, and PTSD is post-traumatic stress disorder.",
