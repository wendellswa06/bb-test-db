        "Yeah.",
        "But I think, even with your son, Sir, just - for you, maybe your son's time over there sparks memories that you've had that you didn't record, and you can actually sit down and write those down now.",
        "And that's something for your son to look back on, for his son later in life to look back on.",
        "And so I think using this - you could still create your own history, you know?",
        "Yup, yup.",
        "You know, there was a - the Desert Shield and Desert Storm wasn't near as bad as what we're going through now.",

        "And so it was pretty tough.",
        "It was pretty tough.",
