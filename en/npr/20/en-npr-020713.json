        "Are there enough trains?",
        "There aren't enough trains for people that want to ride them.",
        "As you said, Amtrak is experiencing record ridership, and the issue is whether federal investment, public investment overall to enable a passenger rail system that people want to ride can be here."

        "Now as I understand it, freight lines actually own the tracks, and they will put their own interests first, understandably from the vantage point of the bananas that have to get someplace.",
        "Is that conceivably a conflict, if there's increased rail passenger traffic?",
        "Well outside the Northeast Corridor and one other location in the country, Amtrak trains do travel on existing freight rail lines.",
        "So certainly the conflict there is readily evident, and of course right now, with increasing demand on the freight rail system, there really is a crunch on capacity.",
        "So this can be a win-win.",
        "If there is an investment in rail infrastructure, we can have the capacity that we need both for new, high-speed train service and increased freight capacity that we're going to need to be competitive in the 21st century.",
        "Do you seen private companies trying to get back into the business?",
        "Right now, Amtrak has a preferred right of access onto the freight system.",
        "So it is the provider of choice for intercity travel.",
        "One of the interesting facets of the recent bill that the House of Representatives passed is that it would open up the potential for other entrants to come in and make the case that they could also operate the service as well.",
        "Do you think there's so much increased interest in rail traffic that a private company would say well, I could make money doing this?",
        "Well, passenger rail service is not for those looking to make money in the business because the capital expenses are so high and the operating expenses are such that every rail operation requires a public investment of some sort.",
        "So it really has to be about a public-private partnership.",
        "Every summer, you get Americans that come back from, let's say, France or Italy, and they'll say why can't we have a high-speed rail system in the United States like they do there.",
        "As you say, if you travel to Europe or Japan or other countries around the world, you see high-speed rail systems that travel over 200 miles an hour directly from downtown to downtown, no crossings where highways intersect, dedicated rights of way, just outstanding service, and people have looked at that for the United States and said why not here?",
        "Time now for your comments."

        "So it's cheap...",

        "You're just getting different stuff.",
        "You're getting different stuff made by the brand because they want you to come to the outlet.",

        "The same thing is happening on Black Friday.",

        "And I would always say, hey, was this here on Wednesday or did you unpack it this morning?",
        "And that can give you a sense of whether it's cheap or it's a real bargain, and there is a difference.",
        "So the sales associate tells you that something arrived just today, you're probably not getting a deal.",
