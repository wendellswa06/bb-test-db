        "That's a radioactive, very lethal, radioactive heavy metal.",
        "And traces of radiation have since been found in the sushi restaurant where Litvinenko ate on November 1st, the day he first got sick.",
        "Radiation has also been detected at the hotel where he met with two former KGB colleagues.",
        "Earlier this week, British Airlines - British Airways - announced that small traces of radiation had been found on flights between Moscow and London.",
        "Now polonium 210 is an unusual choice of poison, first because it's hard to come by, but also it ravages the body very quickly and it decays very fast and has to be handled by an expert.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Let's talk about polonium 210.",
        "Why would it be a good choice for poison?",
        "Well, it's pretty unique in a couple of respects.",
        "I think a few things make it very good.",
        "First of all, it's absorbed from the gut.",
        "Most heavy metals would be very poorly absorbed from the guts and so you wouldn't get it going into the blood stream and causing a radiation dose.",
        "So that's one thing, OK.",
        "Another thing is, is it's a pure alpha emitter, although at very low frequency, it produces some gamma rays.",
        "And this means and this means it can't be detected at airport scanners and things like this.",
        "You could pass right through without it being detected.",

        "But the most important thing is it has an Apple-like simplicity to it.",
        "But behind the scenes, it's learning about your patterns, about how you prefer temperature when you're in the house and when you are away, and it begins to tailor a plan for you personally and for your home that will - at least in theory - increase your comfort and decrease your energy usage.",
        "On the other hand, this is $250, which is a lot more than you would pay for one of those normal round dumb ones.",
