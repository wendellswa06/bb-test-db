        "So the next way you could do it is you could find what they call an orphan radium source.",
        "One of the old sources were produced in the 1920s, 1930s, and there are a few of those missing or being found in Russia, and it's capable - these, in theory, you could remove the polonium 210 from these.",
        "But again, that would be very difficult because you would be irradiated by the radium and that would cause big problems.",
        "The third way, which has been speculated about, would be for the polonium to be extracted from anti-static devices which are used in the photographic industry.",
        "Now that would be about the right amount of polonium 210, but the difficulty is that you have to remove it from these anti-static devices - which isn't easy because they're designed to be more or less tamper-proof.",
        "And if you succeeded in, say, dissolving this sample up, you would dissolve other metals and you'd end up with a cocktail of materials which would be very difficult for somebody to swallow.",
        "It'd be pretty unpalatable.",
        "So that leaves the fourth and most likely method, and that is it was produced as polonium 210 from a target made with bismuth in a nuclear reactor.",
        "And would that be a medical reactor, or one - the kind where nuclear power is made?",
        "No, it wouldn't be a nuclear power reactor.",
        "It would be a reactor which was used to make medical isotopes, or conceivably, also it could be a materials testing reactor which are used for the development of nuclear power.",
        "How dangerous - I'll let you take a drink of water there, or something - how dangerous would somebody be, coming in contact with anybody who has been exposed to this kind of radiation?",
        "Well, up to the point where this Italian gentleman - Italian friend of his - is being confirmed as being significantly contaminated, one would think that the chances of somebody becoming contaminated from him would be small.",
        "Now you have to reassess the position, slightly, because maybe the risk is greater than we thought, but probably more likely, they were both contaminated at the same time because they were both in the restaurant.",
        "Being contaminated from aircraft seats and things like this, it really isn't incredibly likely at all, and it's difficult to imagine how anybody could be significantly contaminated from sorts of contamination which you'd find on door handles, on seats, on clothes and this sort of thing.",
        "How were they able to - it has a very short half-life, does it not?",
        "Well, it's not very short.",
        "It's about 138 days."

        "Right.",
        "So you could then go back to the seats and wherever these gentlemen were, and ostensibly in the airport, and find some traces of it?",
        "Yes.",
        "It's a sort of forensic trail, which they're leaving.",
        "So the levels are described as trace.",
        "And certainly in the UK, and with the people who are involved, if they describe them as trace that they would mean that they were fairly close to the detection limits.",
        "And so that would be an incredibly small fraction of the material which was actually put in Mr. Litvinenko, which was probably a thousand, million, alpha disintegrations per-second, some sort of - about that sort of level.",
        "What kind of forensic work do you think will crack this case?",
        "Well, of course, it is a question of whether forensic will crack it.",
        "I'm a biologist, not a politician, but it doesn't take too much (unintelligible) to realize that there are a few political overtones in this.",
        "And it may be that people know exactly who did it but can't prove it and - or perhaps they don't want to get involved with the political fallout.",
        "And I think it's interesting that the British police haven't described it as a murder.",
        "They're still describing it as a suspicious death.",
        "That would be politics, if you describe it...",
        "Yeah, I think so.",
        "...as a murder.",
        "To your knowledge is this the first case of poisoning by polonium?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It is the book title right there, you know.",
        "It's probably the first case - it's certainly the first case I've heard of.",
        "It's the first case of anybody being killed with acutely, that's with an early death radiation type (unintelligible) syndrome.",
        "With an alpha emitter, other people have had intakes of other alpha emitters, like plutonium, and they may, especially in the Soviet Union, and they may have died 20 years later as a consequence of cancer.",
        "But somebody dying within a short time of acute radiation poisoning, I don't think has ever happened before unless they tried it out on somebody else beforehand."

        "What - I know you're not a doctor, I don't want you to speculate, but do you think that this Italian gentleman has high enough dosage that he might also be - his life might be in danger.",
        "The Islamic Republic is and has always been a coalition government, in the sense that they have always been sort of competing centers of power.",
        "Even in the era of conservative consolidation as has taken place since 2004.",

        "Now, if it was being described as a significant amount, then I would have thought well, this is a large amount and that it could give rise to an increased risk of cancer in later life - particularly given the distribution of polonium in the body - of leukemia, perhaps five years down the line.",
        "However, when they described it being of immediate concern, it may mean the levels are somewhat higher than this.",
        "In which case they might be worried about things like bone marrow (unintelligible) radiation knocking out the bone marrow.",
        "If that happened, then the person would lose his resistance to the disease.",

        "Some believe that Iran must have approved Hezbollah's cross-border raid that triggered the fighting more than three weeks ago, though there's no evidence of that.",
        "Others describe Israel's response to the attack as a pre-existing plan designed to reduce Iranian influence.",
        "Some argue that Iran hope's to divert world attention from efforts to curb its nuclear ambitions.",
        "And others say that what we're seeing is a proxy war between Iran and the United States.",

        "What's going on?",

        "It's an interesting dynamic in Iran, which is the reverse of the Arab world.",
        "In the Arab world, you've seen governments that have been kind of silent.",
        "The implication is that they're eager to see, or at least willing to see, Hezbollah dismantled - while the streets in the Arab world have been very agitated and angry.",

        "That said, yes, there is definitely a growing sense of confidence seeming to emerge.",
        "They definitely are projecting this idea that they have - they are assuming the role of the leader of the Arab - excuse me, of the Muslim world.",
