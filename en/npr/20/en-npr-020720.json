        "And the concern is - and maybe we're beginning to see this already - is the agendas of Hezbollah and Iran diverge at this point.",
        "Hezbollah will view itself as simple fighting a war, and will need to do and use all of its capabilities.",
        "Iran, I'm told, is encouraging them to hold back.",
        "To not show all of their cards, so that if the fighting stops - I think from Iran's perspective they're looking for that sooner than later - they will maintain some deterrence capability.",
        "And we just heard, I think, in just the last hour, Hassan Nasrallah in an address on Lebanese television - on his station there - talking about threatening to hit Tel-Aviv if Beirut is hit.",
        "And that, of course, would mean using their longest-range missile that people suspect they've got.",
        "And thus far, at least, he's not made empty threats.",
        "Well, again, one of the things that seems to be a divergence of agendas is the escalation of this conflict.",
        "It would appear that neither Syria, which is also a backer of Hezbollah, nor Iran really wants it to escalate.",
        "It would seem in their interest for a cease-fire where nobody is the clear victor.",
        "And if that is the case, then they can certainly boast that from their perspective Hezbollah won.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And let me ask you one other question.",
        "And that is, as you've said, the Iranian leadership - the president and the supreme, the supreme leader - have both criticized Arab governments in the region for doing nothing against Israel.",
        "Iran, though it's far away, Iran does have some capabilities against Israel if it wants to use them.",
        "Is anybody criticizing Iran for not doing anything?",
        "No, because Hezbollah is viewed as Iran - I mean, at least through much of the region.",
        "When you hear people talk about Hezbollah fighting back, there's an implicit understanding, recognition, that this is Iran working through a proxy force - that the weapons, the missiles, certainly the missile that hit the ship, the missiles that are flying in, the level of training, the infrastructure that is built - all that is credited to Iran.",
        "Whether or not Iran is taking that credit right now, that's where the credit is going.",
        "I'm also not sure the extent to which - and I'm not a military expert - but I'm not sure the extent to which Iran actually has a military capability to attack Israel beyond Hezbollah.",
        "One guy that I spoke to there, again affiliated with the government, said he doesn't think they do.",
        "They have some missiles but they're not terribly accurate.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "You know, when you start shooting missiles and everything is so close together, you might hit the wrong place.",
        "And does Iran - again, reading between the lines - Does the Iranian leadership see this as a proxy war between itself and the United States?",
        "Yes, definitely.",
        "They definitely believe that they are the ones being attacked, that Lebanon is nothing but a proxy battlefield, that this is payback by the United States.",
        "And that this is the United States' effort to undermine their influence and strategic capabilities in the region.",
        "There is also - I'm told - I don't know this firsthand but I'm told of growing fear and anxiety that they will be hit."

        "Let's bring another voice into the conversation.",
        "Ray Takeyh is a senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
        "He was born in Iran, is now a United States citizen.",
        "He has written widely about Iran, has a new book coming out in October called Hidden Iran: Paradox and Power in the Islamic Republic.",
        "He joins us from the studios of The Council on Foreign Relations here in Washington.",
        "Nice to have you on the program today.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Do you agree with Michael Slackman's reading, that this is a proxy war from the Iranian point of view, between them and the United States?",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "I think if you look at the commentary that's coming out of Iran, they're suggesting that this is the first and an important campaign launched by the United States and Israel to transform the Middle East to their own strategic benefit.",
        "So, it's an episode in a much larger picture of conflict between the two countries.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And in terms of his portrait of Iranian internal politics, does that jibe with what you've been hearing?",
        "Oh yes, that's right, in a sense that there has long been a cleavage between state and society on issue of support for the Palestinian struggle, and of course, Hezbollah as well - in a sense that many Iranians don't have that sort of visceral attachment to the Palestinian or Lebanese struggle.",
        "And as Michael was mentioning, they would like to have the resources that the regime devotes to this cause to be spent on domestic economic infrastructure and all the other problems that Iran has.",
        "I think most Iranians, if you put it up to a vote, would not support the country giving a billion dollars a year in fuel subsidies to prop up this sort of autocratic government of Syria - while they have their own fuel shortages and there's all kinds of discussions, as was mentioned, about potential rationing of petroleum.",
        "Well, I happen to agree completely.",
        "But my father didn't see it that way.",
        "Well I - definitely.",
        "I mean, the leadership of Iran is trying to - has recently been, I think, in central Asia - but I think more specifically they're focusing on the region.",
        "They're looking to redefine the strategic balance of power in the region - away from the traditional capitals of Amman, Riyadh and Cairo - towards Tehran.",
        "I think that's - rather than global - global power - I think at the moment that's what they were looking for.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And prior to this conflict, I think they felt that they were marching in the right direction, that they were successful."

        "Ray Takeyh, we'll get your response to that in a few minutes.",

        "Experts say the weapons probably come from Iran, which openly supports Hezbollah.",

        "What does Iran hope to get out of this?",
        "Well, I think Iran doesn't really have aspirations to become a global power, but certainly an important actor in the Middle East and in the larger Islamic community beyond the Middle East.",
        "And if this crisis yields a Hezbollah that is acclaimed by - not just the Arab street but a Muslim street - then Iran as principal advisor, as indeed Hezbollah is a protÃ©gÃ© if Iran, gets Islamic republic some political dividend among the inhabitants of the Middle East, most certainly, but perhaps even points beyond."

        "Gary's calling us from San Diego.",
        "Hi.",
        "Thank you for taking my call and as always, I appreciate this forum on the air.",
        "My question is: most of us here in the West really have very little idea of what goes on inside Iran on a daily basis.",
        "And I'm wondering just about whether the government of Iran - the president and you know, the surrounding bodies - really reflects and represents the will of the people of Iran, and how much of a disconnect is there between the will of people and those who are in power?",
        "On this particular issue, on terms of Iran's involvement in the Arab-Israeli conflict, I think there is a large divergence between the leadership and the public at large - as I think it was mentioned in the previous segment.",
        "Most Iranians are rather indifferent to Palestinian struggle, or for that matter, the Hezbollah's on tribulations.",
        "You know, from their perspective that Iran doesn't have this sort of emotive attachment to this conflict.",
        "It doesn't have a Palestinian refugee problem.",
        "It is a non-Arab state.",
        "So, in that sense, the leadership's attachment to this issue, which is 27 years standing, is in contradiction to public sentiments.",
        "Can I ask a quick follow-up then?",
        "Sure, go ahead.",
        "With that in mind, it sounds to me as though you're saying that really the people of Iran aren't necessarily 100 percent behind it, and that the government is sort of asserting its will.",
        "I am wondering, really - as I'm sure many people are wondering, and concerned - that this really has all of the elements to widen to a larger - global, of not world-war - type of scenario, and I would like to get a little bit of feedback and...",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that the Iranian government, as well as frankly, Hezbollah, perceived that this would be a limited conflict - in the sense that Hezbollah would capture a couple of Israeli soldiers, and essentially perhaps release some of the pressure that was being placed by the Israeli government on the Palestinian authority.",
        "Because this crisis has obscured the fact that the Palestinian authority - the Hamas government - was under considerable military pressure by Israel.",
        "So, it was essentially perhaps planned as a diversion from that.",
        "And I think Iranians probably conceded to that.",
        "But as the scope of Israeli retaliation and even potential internationalization of this conflict has come about, I think Iranians and Hezbollah as well are hoping a quick cease-fire and somehow a return to status quo ante - in a sense that Hezbollah retains some of its capabilities and perhaps emerges in a politically more advantageous position.",
        "But I think the inclination on part of these governments and this movement in Lebanon at this particular point, is to limit the cost of this conflict as opposed to its geographic expansion.",
        "Gary, thanks very much.",
        "Let's turn now to Amanda.",

        "Sure.",
        "My question is this: The Middle East is fairly, you know, interconnected in terms of its politics.",
        "And with the recent United States government support of the Shiite government in Iraq, how much of this conflict between Hezbollah and Israel is the response to, you know, the pushing aside of the Shiites - considering Iran has a formidable Shiite population?",
        "Well, we're witnessing in the Middle East today, a unique phenomenon - namely, the empowerment of the Shiite community - obviously, in the case if Iraq, certainly in Iran as a majority Shiite community, some 90 percent - and even in Hezbollah, its case itself.",
        "Hezbollah has always been one of the leading representatives of Lebanon Shiite community in the sort of multi-confessional Lebanese state.",
        "However, for a long time the Shiite empowerment was coming through electoral process - being elected in Iraq and similarly in Lebanon as well.",
        "I think Hezbollah's incursion into Israel and the Israeli response, perhaps potentially, could diminish its political appeal to non-Shiite members of the Lebanese community - in a sense that Lebanon had finally reclaimed its independence from Syrian occupation and was trying to devote its economic resources to rebuilding the national infrastructure after the long period of civil war in that country.",
        "And suddenly, for the third time, Beirut is destroyed again.",
        "And a catalyst for that destruction is Hezbollah.",
        "Now in the long term, I think that will read down to its political disadvantage.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thanks for the call, Amanda.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "As this continues - and by the way, I mentioned earlier this hour, Hassan Nasrallah threatened to launch missiles against Tel Aviv if Israel continued to attack in Beirut.",
        "And Israel has responded with threats of its own - it should be noted Israel rarely issues empty threats either - that if Tel Aviv was attacked it would destroy Lebanon's infrastructure.",
        "So, this does go on."
