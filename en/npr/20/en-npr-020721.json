        "Can you talk for a moment with us about the relationship of Hezbollah and Iran?",
        "Is Hezbollah a creation of Iran?",
        "To what degree is it independent?",
        "The relationship between Iran's clerical community and the Lebanese Shiite community actually predates the Iranian Revolution.",
        "The relationships that were forged in seminaries, bonds often tied with marriage, and so on.",
        "Hezbollah came to scene in the aftermath of Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 when Iranians began to organize the Shiia community that had largely been passive and excluded from Lebanese political system and privileges of power.",
        "So, it was Iranian Revolutionary Guards in conjunction with activist clerics in Lebanon that actually created Hezbollah.",
        "Since then, Hezbollah had gone on to assume its own identity and has exercised a degree of autonomy from the Iranian leadership.",
        "Hezbollah has a duel identity at this particular point.",
        "On the one hand, it is a political party.",
        "It has seats in the parliament, representation in the Lebanese cabinet.",
        "It operates a rather extensive social network, in terms of schools, hospitals, and so forth.",
        "So it's very much part of the Lebanese society.",
        "Yet on the other hand, Hezbollah has always also been a vanguard Islamic organization, very much animated by an anti-Israeli, anti-Zionist impulses.",
        "I think to suggest that Hezbollah is a sort of a automatic actor of Iran, in a sense that it takes direction from Iran, is to misread how this movement, how this party has evolved since its creation - admittedly, with Iranian assistance - some 24 years ago.",
        "Let's get another caller in on the line.",
        "This is Roger.",
        "Roger calling from Lexington in South Carolina.",
        "Hello, Roger.",
        "Are you there?",
        "I think Roger has left us, so we'll hang up on Roger and turn to Sayad(ph).",
        "Sayad is calling from Green Bay, in Wisconsin",
        "Yes, thank you very much for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "I just wanted to say that the Iranian people have no inherent dispute with Israel or the Jews.",
        "In fact, historically, we have more of a dispute with Arabs than we do with Jews.",
        "We are the descendents of Cyrus The Great, proud of our heritage of multiculturalism and pluralism.",
        "We are the society in which Muslims and Jews coexisted and lived in peace, side by side until the Islamic Republic of Iran came in in 1979.",
        "The vile anti-Semitism that is articulated by the ayatollahs in Iran, in fact, is offensive to the national identity of Iranian heritage.",
        "Hezbollah is the enemy of the Iranian people.",
        "Hezbollah has conducted assassinations of over 200 Iranian freedom fighters and dissidents, in the decades of the 1980s and 1990s, all over Europe.",
        "And is there a question in there, Sayed?"

        "He did raise one point, and that is Iran's relationship with the Arab states, which has not always been easy.",
        "They certainly supported Iraq during the Iran/Iraq War.",
        "That's true, and the relationship between Iran and the Sunni Arab powers has actually, in some ways, worsened since the American invasion of Iraq in March 2003 and the resulting empowerment of the Shiia community.",
        "The monarch of Jordan, the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, and most recently Hosny Mubarak of Egypt have all warned that the rising Shiite resurgence benefits Iran and that all these political parties, whether they're in Iraq or Lebanon, are sort of subsidiaries of the Iranian government.",
        "I've think that's rather exaggerated.",
        "But nevertheless, there's anxiety in Sunni capitals of the Middle East that - as a result of, frankly, American action, and as a result of American insistence on democracy promotion - that is resulting in this sort of a resurgence of the Shiite block, and sort of a Shiia crescent, even.",
        "And the leadership of that crescent lies in Tehran.",
        "As I mentioned, that's sort of a paranoid style of Arab politics.",
        "But never the less, the divisions between the Islamic Republic of Iran and some of its Sunni neighbors is beginning to be even more tense.",
        "And of course there are important Shiia minorities - well, a majority, of course, in Iraq - but minorities in places like Kuwait, Bahrain, the Gulf states.",
        "And in Bahrain, it's actually the Shiia majority.",
        "And certainly Kuwait has a sizeable Shiia minority, and Saudi Arabia has about 15 percent Shiia community, but that is situated rather strategically in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, which tend to have many lucrative oil facilities.",
        "And historically, these Shi communities have not been well integrated into the society, much less the political life of these organizations.",
        "They're largely viewed and treated as second-class citizens.",
        "And as such, now that they're looking across the border to an emerging strong Iran, and increasingly to the Shiia brethren in Iraq reclaiming political power, the fear is that that could stimulate their own aspirations.",
        "Our guest is Ray Takeyh, senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
        "His forthcoming book is called Hidden Iran: Paradox and Power in the Islamic Republic.",

        "Email is talk@npr.org.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And speak to us, if you would - we were talking earlier with Michael Slackman of the New York Times about the Iranian leadership, and about the various sources of power.",
        "Who's in charge and what are the various factions or groups that influence governmental policy?"

        "Today, of course, there's a strident and a very harsh ideologue in terms of Iranian president, that in some way uneases the elders of the revolution, the clerical community and so forth.",
        "There's a great deal of ideological commonality between them, but sometime his style tends to be rather concern to them.",
        "It's hard to say how much support this Iranian government has.",
        "Estimates are it has 10 to 15 percent of the population that is ordinarily supportive of the government.",
        "But it's a 10 and 15 percent of the population that can immobilize and put into street.",
        "It has rather developed coercive capabilities, and rather strong and nationwide intelligence capability.",
        "So it has some degree of domestic stability.",
        "Iran has structural economic problems, in a sense that it has demographic issues.",
        "And as Michael was mentioning, it has seriously dilapidating oil infrastructure, which is fairly bad for a country that relies on oil as its principle source of revenue.",
        "But at this particular point, both economically and politically, the Iranian government is rather stable.",
        "What is the relationship between this crisis between Hezbollah and Israel - Iran and the United States, if you will - and the coincidental, or maybe not-so-coincidental crisis between Iran and the United States and its allies on the security council who are giving Iran until August 31 to respond to a security council resolution demanding that it stop uranium enrichment.",
        "Actually, it's quite impossible to answer that question because it's sort of presumes some sort of a foreknowledge of the operational discussions between the Hezbollah movement and the Iranian patrons.",
        "I suspect that there were some perceptions within Tehran that this crisis could divert attention from Iran's ongoing dispute with the international community on this contested nuclear program.",
        "In the long run it may work out that way, but just this week, Security Council passed another resolution demanding Iranian compliance with its IAEA obligations.",
        "So the process of the United Nations - the bureaucratic processes are continuing to go forward irrespective of this crisis.",
        "It hasn't thwarted those efforts.",
        "I think the most recent Security Council vote was 14-to-1.",
        "However, in the long run, if as result of this crisis there's a divergence between the United States government and at least the European public opinion - and that certainly seems to be the case - and the European public opinion pushing the European governments to distance themselves from the American government and its rather staunch support of Israel.",
        "The question that the European governments will face - and the Russians and the Chinese as well, in the next several months - is would they want a third crisis in the Middle East.",
        "There's crisis Iraq, in the sense that the country is uneasily in descending into a civil war.",
        "There is a crisis in the Israeli- Palestinian-Lebanese front, that even the stabilization of this particular conflict is not going to remove - in the sense that Gaza and the Palestinian authority are still a mess, and who knows what the nature of the multinational force on the Israeli/Lebanese border would be, even if such force manifests itself.",
        "So does the international community, do the Europeans, the Chinese, the Russians, want to open up a third crisis and a potential confrontation with Iran over its nuclear program.",
        "That's the question they will have to decide for themselves in the next several months.",
        "And I think the crisis in Lebanon may work in that sense, in Iran's advantage, in the sense that's there's a crisis fatigue in the Middle East today."
