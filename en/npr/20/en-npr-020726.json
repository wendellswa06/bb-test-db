        "The one thing the Wimbledon crowd likes - and they've gotten it over the last few years - is a highly dramatic, thrilling match.",

        "You know, speaking of legacies, this was the 13th Grand Slam title for Serena Williams.",
        "That pushed her past Billy Jean King.",
        "So what does this mean for her in history?",
        "Well, what it means for Serena - and she pretty much goes out there and plays.",
        "She tries to ignore both the positive and the negative records.",
        "But now I think that she realizes she's sixth place on the all-time list of overall Grand Slam titles.",
        "She's got 13.",
        "Now she's five behind Martina Navratilova and Chris Everett, two of the greatest American players of all time.",
        "So at age 28, if she keeps committed and she keeps being driven and she keeps herself healthy - which Serena is, by far, the most important thing - she's got a shot at tying those two.",
        "And if she does tie those two, she could go down in history as one of the top three, four players ever.",
        "And I think at the end of the day when she retires, that would mean an awful lot to her.",

        "In the health care debate, many agree that the payment system for doctors and hospitals is not working well.",
        "They're compensated for each procedure they perform, giving them a perverse incentive to perform more procedures.",
        "Yet that system known as fee-for-service prevails nationwide.",

        "As president and CEO of Medica, Minnesota's second-biggest health insurer, Tilford fears medical-expense inflation is too much a burden on employers, who are Medica's main customers.",
        "And some employers, especially on the smaller end, are dropping coverage altogether, because it's simply become unaffordable.",
        "So we had an obligation to do something.",
        "We couldn't simply sit idly by while our customers were struggling the way they were.",
        "So about a year and a half ago, Tilford met for drinks with Mark Eustis.",
        "Up till then, the two men were adversaries.",
        "Tilford's firm, Medica, was paying ever-higher bills on claims from Fairview Health Services, the not-for-profit that Eustis heads.",
        "It has seven hospitals and 49 clinics.",
        "Eustis says he was tired of trying to defend a broken system and wanted to do something different.",
        "But recognize if you do something different in today's reimbursement world, you'll generate less funds, because we're in a fee-for-service world that actually pays you to do more.",
        "If you really manage utilization appropriately, if you try to reduce costs, be more efficient, more effective, you get paid less.",
        "So Eustis and Tilford struck a deal.",
        "The insurance company agreed to provide an undisclosed amount of money to help Fairview, Minnesota's second-largest health care provider, move from fee-for-service billing to a system based on fixed payments.",
        "Tilford says it was by no means a gift to Fairview.",
        "Well, I think in coaching you get done playing a team and the first thing you think is, are they what you thought?",
        "This team's actually better than I thought.",
        "I don't think we played our best game.",
        "But again, Kentucky is really, really good."

        "As Baylor was left to wonder how many NBA teams could shut down Kentucky for 40 minutes, Kansas and North Carolina were locked in a furious battle.",
        "The half-time score saw both teams at 47 points and the game announcers calling this perhaps the most exciting game of the tournament.",

        "First half, we didn't guard anybody.",
        "It was a horse contest.",
        "And they're not the type of team you want to get in a horse contest with.",
        "Before the tournament, there was a perception that North Carolina, though deserving of the one seed, seemed to lack grit.",
        "This game gave lie to such talk.",
        "Center Tyler Zeller winced through pain; forward John Henson, his wrist bandaged, soldiered on; and Stillman White, the third-string point guard, pressed into service when the starter broke a wrist, was simply error-free.",

        "On the other is Louisville and Kentucky- the team that has gone, in the eyes of most fans, from solidly credentialed to practically incredible.",
        "You can't beat Kentucky in a battle of skill, but perhaps they're vulnerable in a battle of wits.",
        "If there is a dry erase board out there with the squiggles and marks that hold the key to thwarting the Wildcats, Louisville coach Rick Pitino is probably the one wielding the marker.",
