        "But there is a lot more educational content coming online.",
        "And that includes entire courses from major universities, such as Stanford.",
        "Phil Hill is an educational consultant with MindWires and he says video is a medium that is setting science free from the limits of textbooks.",
        "Video is very natural to show, particularly physics and chemistry-based disciplines, to actually show these scientific phenomena.",
        "Hill says many people in the education field have been surprised at how popular education videos are.",
        "I'm not aware of anybody who's predicted how much interest would be drawn to this.",
        "So as we head into 2014, Hill predicts that education videos are only going to get more popular - though he admits they may never be as popular as videos about game videos."

        "We're in a situation where the number of failing states in the world is increasing each year.",
        "And one of the principal reasons for that is there's a growing backlog of unresolved problems that are putting, that is putting more and more stress on governments and the weaker governments are simply beginning to break down.",
        "Within the developing countries, where most the failing states are, one of the causes of this is continuing rapid population.",
        "If you look at the 20 top countries on the list of failing states, 17 of them have reached a population growth between two and three and a half percent per year.",
        "And just to remind ourselves of the arithmetic, a population that's growing at three percent per year multiplies 20-fold in a century.",
        "I mean, it sounds like a mathematical error, but unfortunately it's not.",
        "So we have a number of countries now who have developed enough to lower mortality, but not enough to lower fertility, they're in what demographers call the demographic trap, where rapid population growth begets poverty, poverty begets rapid population growth."
