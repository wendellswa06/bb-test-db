        "And countries cannot stay in this area over the long term.",
        "They either will figure out how to break out of it or they will begin breaking down and what we're now beginning to see is a substantial number beginning to break down because of land scarcity, soil erosion, deforestation, water shortages and inability to build schools fast enough, an inability to expand food production fast enough.",
        "So these stresses are beginning to manifest, manifest themselves in the growing number of state failures, but we also now have three major new stresses on governments that are just emerging.",
        "One is associated with peak oils we've just noted and then the very high-price of oil and we may, in a matter of years, look at a hundred dollar a barrel of oil as cheap oil.",
        "So these put stress particularly on low and middle-income countries.",
        "And then we have the effort particularly in the United States to convert a growing share of the U.S.",
        "grain harvest into fuel for cars.",
        "And this is driving up world grain prices and world food prices.",
        "In effect, what we have is a situation where the - because we can now convert grain, in effect, into oil, actually into ethanol, the price of grain is tied to the price of oil.",
        "Because if the food value of a commodity is less than its fuel value, the market will move that commodity into the fuel economy.",
        "So we have this unique competition we've never seen before between people who own cars, 860 million, and the two billion poorest people in the world competing for the same grain supplies.",
        "This is from a moral and political point of view.",
        "An entirely new sort of issue the world is facing and we're having trouble grasping it and addressing it.",
        "And the third thing, of course, is the fallout from climate change.",
        "So we have three - whether it's droughts or heat waves or floods or rising sea level or what have you - so we have these new stresses on governments now.",
        "And the risk is that the number of failing states will continue increasing and the culmination of that risk, of course, is that if you have enough failing states, then civilization itself begins to break down.",
        "So the stakes now are very high in terms of what we need to be doing and the consequences of failing to take the needed actions.",
        "Talking with Lester Brown, author of \"\"Plan B 3.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization.\"\" And in your chapter on mobilizing and the great mobilization, you say things have gotten so bad that you say, forget about the Kyoto Treaty, global warming-wise, that's not - that's not even going to save us.",
        "We have to take even more draconian methods of saving the planet.",
        "In Kansas and Oklahoma, the power companies there at looking at the potential for building wind farms and transmitting it to the southeastern United States.",
        "We've got enormous potential and the transmission is not a major issue.",
        "And, in fact, it's something that we need to be doing anyhow.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The idea of negotiating another successor to the Kyoto Protocol and then waiting some years for enough countries to ratify it for it to take effect would take so much time that the game might well be over even before it was ratified.",
        "So, I think, if we're going to make it, it's going to be because individual governments begin to step forward and take major steps.",
        "What are - let's name some of those steps, what steps?",
        "Well, let me use a concrete example of New Zealand where they have taken three steps so far in their effort to cut carbon emissions and to maybe someday be carbon-neutral as Prime Minister Helen Clark describes it.",
        "One is they are going to increase the renewable energy share of their electricity supply, which is already quite high at 70 percent to 90 percent by 2020."

        "That's a lot of carbon fixation.",
        "Now they've just decided to take these steps on their own and they have several more coming there in the plate line being worked on.",
        "But they haven't said we'll do it if Australia does it or if the United States does it or if the rest of the world does it, they're just doing it.",

        "BROWN: In Texas, somewhat surprisingly, we have a governor and a state legislature working together to develop - to put together a program to develop 23,000 megawatts of wind energy.",

        "Yeah, that's an amazing story down there.",

        "This is an amazing development.",
        "Or in the U.K., just in the last few weeks, we've had the minister of business - in this country we'd call him probably the Secretary of Commerce - say, we need to build, we want to build 35,000 megawatts of wind-generated electricity offshore.",
        "Now, people worry about the offshore view and so forth.",
        "He said, you know, this is something we're going to have to get used to.",
        "We're going to have wind turbines probably every half mile off our coast.",
        "But when you think about it, the alternative is not to have a coastline there, because if we keep spilling out carbon emissions on such a huge scale, the temperature is going to go up, ice will keep melting and sea level will rise.",
        "So we're beginning to see interesting steps now.",
        "We have Algeria, for example, deciding to build 6,000 megawatts of solar thermal power plants in the desert, and to export that electricity to Europe by cable.",
        "They see the day when their oil is going to be gone and they expect to replace it with, in effect, the exports of solar energy in the form of electricity to Europe.",
        "So we're seeing some dramatic advances.",
        "Another one in Germany - very - also very recently, in just the last few weeks, I think it's by January 1st, 2009, all new buildings will have to have - including homes - all new structures will have to have a solar heating and cooling - sorry - a solar water and space heating facility on the roof.",
        "So we're beginning to see some exciting advances here.",
        "And another one, Iceland, which used to get all of its heat for buildings from coal.",
        "Now, 90 percent of all the homes and buildings in total in Iceland are heated with geothermal energy."

        "And in talking with economists who study this, almost all the leading economists that I know support restructuring the tax system, rather than cap and trade.",

        "I mentioned that because there's a lot of thinking going on in this field now.",
        "And the convergence appears to be on wind energy and plug-in hybrid cars as two of the key answers to how we can cut carbon emissions 80 percent by 2020.",

        "So from December 7th to - '41 to January 6th, 1942, the government put together these plans.",
