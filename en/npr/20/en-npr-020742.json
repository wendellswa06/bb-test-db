        "How do we do that?",
        "MR.",
        "BROWN: It's just a matter of building transmission lines.",
        "And we actually, in this country, have already agreed that we need a national electrical grid.",
        "We have these locals sort of jerry-built things that have evolved over the last century or so, and they're not really that efficient.",
        "And after the power failure - was it three, four years ago in the summer, where a large part of the northeast lost power for a day or two - there was a commission that looked into that and their conclusion was that we need a national grid and a strong national grid that ties regions together.",
        "So it's entirely within reach to do this and it would be, in the long term, a very efficient thing to do.",
        "But there are, even now, transmission lines being built in California, in Texas and in the Northern Plains beginning to link South Dakota and North Dakota with Minnesota and Midwestern cities.",
        "There is even talk in the Great Plains of building wind farms and transmission lines coming all the way to Northeast.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Not entirely.",
        "There are some states beginning to work together now, to put this together.",
        "There are numbers of long distant transmission lines.",
        "There's one that originates in Wyoming and goes to Utah and Nevada into California.",
        "The four governors are working on there.",
        "And the purpose of that is to link the extraordinary wind resources in Wyoming with consumers in those other states, most importantly in California.",
        "Do you think that Americans feel the same urgency that you do about this?",
        "Will it be an election issue this year?",
        "Is it moving up in the polls?",
        "It is not yet.",
        "But it is surprising how many people are now beginning to become concerned about these issues.",
        "One of the manifestations of this is the fast-growing movement to block the construction of new coal-fired power plants and to instead move toward investments in efficiency and in renewable sources of energy like wind farms, for example.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I've just read it and I can't remember which state has successfully blocked - they blocked construction plans.",
        "I think there have been 41."

        "Is that right?",
        "Forty-one plants have been blocked.",
        "One of the biggest was in Florida.",
        "Governor Crist there, Charles Crist, who replaced Jeb Bush as governor just within the year or so, has completely turned around the energy policy.",
        "And he's basically said they are not going to build anymore fossil-fueled power plants in Florida and they are going to develop renewable resources.",
        "And they're planning one of the - maybe the largest solar thermal power plant in the world there.",
        "Same thing as a large coal-fired power complex was recently turned down in Kansas by the state government.",
        "And it's happened in many states now.",
        "But you say the second part of this formula - for making us energy independent and getting so much energy from the wind - is the move toward plug-in automobiles.",
        "Yes.",
        "We would be able - you know, it sounds like a no-brainer.",
        "You go - you park your car to go shopping or whatever and there's a little plug right there.",
        "Maybe, you know, you pay it through the meter.",
        "You pay it through, you know, some sort of a metering system.",
        "You're at home, you just plug it in when you're not using it, you know.",
        "To me, it's just like it's such a simple idea.",
        "There have two technological advances in recent years that have set the stage for creating an entirely new U.S.",
        "automotive fuel economy, indeed, a world on motor fuel economy.",
        "These two technologies are the hybrid car, thanks to Toyota which pioneered with the Prius, and the advances in wind turbine design.",
        "Once you have a hybrid car, you have the option of increasing the battery storage capacity in it and introducing a plug-in capacity.",
        "So you can recharge those batteries at night while you're sleeping, when electricity is cheap.",
        "And then you can do most of your driving with electricity rather than gasoline.",
        "And this is an exciting option.",
        "Again, I was talking - when I talked with Michael McElroy last night, he's calculated that in Boston, the cost of a gallon equivalent of electricity for car is $1.40.",
        "And this is in a part of the country where the price of electricity is 19 cents a kilowatt hour.",
        "I mean it's way above the national average.",
        "So what we're looking at is the potential of fueling our cars with electricity under $1 a gallon gasoline equivalent.",
        "You say in your book we need to persuade our elected representatives and national leaders to support the environmental tax restructuring and other changes outlined in \"\"Plan B.\"\" What kind of tax structuring are we talking about here?",
        "Because of the way our tax system evolved, it turned out it was easier to tax income payroll taxes than almost anything else.",
        "And so we rely heavily on these income taxes to provide the revenue to run the government and the country.",
        "But what we're now beginning to realize is that we shouldn't be taxing work.",
        "We want people to work.",
        "And we want labor to be as inexpensive as possible.",
        "If you load a lot of taxes on it, it becomes more costly.",
        "So the goal is a simple one.",
        "And, again, it's sorted by - supported by thousands of economists including a list of Nobel Prize-winning economists, to simply lower income taxes and offset that with a carbon tax.",
        "And those who are good at reducing the use of carbon, whether, say, electricity or gasoline or what have you, will be the winners in this, and they'll benefit.",
        "But the whole purpose of it is to get the mark-up to tell the environmental truth.",
        "And right now, the amount that we pay for coal-fired electricity, for example, doesn't begin to cover the damages from burning the coal in terms of climate change, air pollution, et cetera."

        "Yeah.",
        "The bottled water thing is an interesting example of how the American people have been conned into thinking that bottled water is healthier than tap water.",
        "In fact, the regulations for tap water in this country are much stiffer than for bottled water in most situations.",
        "And in some cities and states now - San Francisco being one of the early leaders, Los Angeles another - we're seeing city governments ban the use of bottled water or the use of taxpayers' money to buy bottled water.",
        "I mean it costs a thousand times as much as tap water.",
        "And we complain about higher prices of gasoline, but we'll pay even more for water that's often inferior to what we can get from the tap.",
        "So this is and that doesn't begin to deal with all the energy use required to produce the bottles, to haul the water around.",

        "But I wanted to ask Mr. Brown two questions.",
        "One, the oceans are acidifying, they'rr taking up a lot of carbon dioxide from the air which turns into carbonic acid, how bad is that problem and is that going to result in, like, extinctions of plankton and other organisms that are at the base of the food chain in the ocean?",
        "And do we need to be actively removing carbon dioxide from the air, like in the very near future...",
        "Let me get an answer.",
        "Oops, traffic.",
        "Yeah, the problem with ocean acidification is a real one.",
        "That's one that scientists have begun to focus on particularly in the last few years.",
        "And it is altering the oceans in ways that are not desirable.",
        "And so the key - I mean this is one of the many consequences of burning fossil fuels on the scale that we are in driving up atmospheric CO2 levels.",
        "So anything we do to cut carbon emissions, as I described in \"\"Plan B 3.0,\"\" will help deal with the ocean acidification problem.",
        "What about carbon sequestration?",
