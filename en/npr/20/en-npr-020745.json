        "So as you heard, you know, health care came up early in the debates.",
        "Is there a center of gravity that unites the Democratic field on this?",
        "Yes.",
        "It's very clear - whether you hear Democrats talking about \"\"Medicare for All\"\", \"\"Medicare for All who want it\"\" - that there is a strong desire for universal coverage of some form for broadly expanding access to health care.",
        "It's very clear from voters that there's a big concern about being able to afford health care.",
        "And candidates, in their own ways, are all trying to address that.",
        "And we'll ask you more about where the voters are versus where the candidates are on that in a minute.",
        "Is there a central dividing line among the Democratic field?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And you saw that very clearly in the debate with the question of \"\"Medicare for All\"\", specifically.",
        "And when we say \"\"Medicare for All\"\", we mean the legislation put forth by Bernie Sanders that Elizabeth Warren just backed as well.",
        "It's a very specific form of legislation.",
        "You would have one program called Medicare but much more generous than the current Medicare program - no co-pays, no deductibles, no cost-sharing, whatsoever, would cover virtually everything, would leave minimal, at most, room for private insurance.",
        "It's very popular amongst the left but gets other Democrats and even some voters a bit more nervous because of the very radical reforms that would implement.",
        "And so what's the other kind of center-of-gravity idea?",
        "This other center-of-gravity idea would be - what?",
        "- that there would be like a dual system, that you could keep your private insurance, and there would be a more robust sort of government-funded option alongside it?",
        "Is that the...",
        "Exactly.",
        "And...",
        "Generally the two ideas in play?",
        "That's something we heard, for instance, Pete Buttigieg talk about.",
        "He called it \"\"Medicare for All who want it.\"\" And we have what's called a public option - right?",
        "- something very robust put forth by the government.",
        "Anyone has the option to buy into this public option if they choose to, or they can stick with the care that they have.",
        "And, finally, where are the Republicans in attacking this?",
        "Because we see that, already, some of the third-party groups and the Republicans are attacking specific candidates, saying that they've flip-flopped and so forth.",
        "But is there a central line of Republican attack?",
        "Is it that these would elevate costs and wouldn't improve care?",
        "Like, what are the Republicans saying about what the Democrats are putting forth?"

        "My plan also includes getting rid of Section 1325 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.",
        "That was former housing secretary and former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro, who's put forward the very straightforward proposal to decriminalize crossing the border.",
        "He says that that will make it easier to deal with the humanitarian crisis there.",
        "So fair to say that all the Democrats and Bernie Sanders criticize the Trump administration's approach to immigration, which was and remains a signature issue for President Trump and his supporters.",
        "That's correct, right?",
        "Col.",
        "MacFARLAND: Well, it was a pretty dangerous place.",
        "The streets were very dangerous to venture out into and, of course, anytime we moved out into the streets, we had to take a great deal of precaution, set of conditions to protect ourselves.",
        "The enemy was able to move around at will throughout most of the city.",
        "There were very few Iraqi security forces and even fewer Iraqi police anywhere to be seen in the area.",
        "So usually, it was Marines or soldiers venturing into the city on very specific patrols.",

        "Col.",

        "I'll stand by that.",
        "There was really no place to go but up, it seemed to me, when we got to Ramadi, and I was willing to try whatever seemed to make sense in order to advance our objectives.",
        "What you did try was to establish posts outside of the guarded base, posts that were exposed - this was a risky strategy - but yet established U.S.",

        "Col.",
        "MacFARLAND: That's right.",
        "The - as I said, the city of Ramadi saw no permanent coalition or Iraqi security force presence within it.",
        "And it seemed to me that before we could consolidate unto larger FOBs, forward operating bases, we had to first establish the Iraqi security forces inside the city and, of course, we had to go in there with them because we owned all the enablers.",
        "And the Iraqi army…",
        "Enablers, in other words, forward air controllers, artillery, things like that.",
        "Col.",
        "MacFARLAND: Tanks.",
        "Exactly right.",
        "And the Iraqi army was very newly formed and they certainly were nowhere near ready to do that, and there were no police.",
        "So we went in with Iraqi army elements accompanying us and established combat outposts inside the city that were comprised of U.S.",
        "and Iraqi forces working side by side.",
        "And our intent was to stay there long enough to establish the Iraqi army initially and then the Iraqi police inside the city, and then first pull off the coalition - the U.S.",
        "forces - and then the Iraqi army, leaving only the police behind.",
        "So that was the model that we were after."

        "So we're talking to the sheikhs to see if we could get any of their young men to join up with the I.P.s, as they're called.",
        "And that's how we've first made contact with the sheikhs.",
        "And this relationship developed until one day, finally, there were agreements that if you could - if you would donate - if a hundred men from your tribe would join the police, they could stay in the area.",
        "They would not be shipped off to another city, for example.",
        "Col.",
        "MacFARLAND: That's right.",
        "My deputy commander, a guy named Lieutenant Colonel Jim Laettner(ph), came upon the idea of a bargain with the Iraqis, with the Iraqi sheikhs and said, hey look, if we were to put one of these new police station - we're looking at building a new police station.",
        "You help us put it where you think it'll do best, then would you be willing to man it?",
        "And they said, well, of course, because then you and the government of Iraq would be training and equipping the people that are securing our families.",
        "And that was their main concern was protecting their families against the terrorist thugs in al-Qaida.",
        "And if we were able to help them do that, that was the beginning of a partnership.",
        "So we established a police station in an area called Jazeera, which was north of the Euphrates River from Ramadi, and that was manned by former police officers from the local tribes up there who didn't require any training because they'd already been trained.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And this led to a broader cooperation with the sheikhs.",
        "Col.",
        "MacFARLAND: It did.",
        "And again, kind of an unintended consequence because this first police station was mainly drawn from the tribes north of the river, and it was attacked by a large truck bomb and killed and wounded a number of the police that were there.",
        "But they refused to abandon their post because they were defending their own families.",
        "And to top it off, al-Qaida also went after the sheikh of the tribe…",
