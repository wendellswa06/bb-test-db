        "And Sheikh Satar had a past, to be sure, but he was looking towards the future.",

        "Hmm.",
        "Just to follow-up on S.J.'s point, some people say in the Iraqi -some of elements of the Iraqi national police and indeed some elements of the Iraqi army, the United States is helping to train and equip a Shia militia and some fear that in a sense, if there's a civil war to come, your tactics may have helped supply and train a Sunni militia.",
        "Col.",
        "MacFARLAND: Well, the folks that we're training in al-Anbar are, at best, home defense.",
        "I mean, they're policemen.",
        "And they're not really the kind of force that can pick up and move to another part of the country to fight with anybody.",
        "They may be able to defend their homes against outsiders like al-Qaida or perhaps even a Shia militia who may come out there on a raid like the Jaish al-Mahdi or somebody like that.",
        "The Mahdi Army is with them.",
        "Col.",
        "MacFARLAND: The Mahdi Army, but they are certainly not going to go into Baghdad and attack anybody.",

        "We're seeing it in, not only in other Sunni provinces, but also in Shia movements, which is something that Satar was predicting almost a year ago to me when nobody believed him, and I was even a bit skeptical that the tribal system cuts across the sectarian lines in Iraq.",

        "Col.",
