        "Can you tell us just a little bit about methodology?",

        "We wanted to hear how this compares to other ideas on the table, so we've called Julia Preston.",
        "She's a contributing writer for The Marshall Project.",
        "That's a nonprofit journalism organization.",
        "And she spent many years covering immigration for The New York Times.",
        "Julia Preston, welcome.",
        "Thanks so much for joining us.",
        "Well, actually, you can if you're an Iraqi, particularly if you're a local Iraqi.",
        "This survey was conducted across Iraq using local interviewers in each province.",
        "We have - the firm we work with has a center where trained interviewers worked from and do their interviews locally, so they're able to move around.",
        "They know the area, so they can get across safely.",
        "They also know the sort of administrative protocols, so they can they stay out of trouble as they're doing their interviews.",
        "So it's all local interviewers, but doing supervised interviews and back-check interviews with a good deal of credible data coming out.",
        "We did an over sample in Anbar province, indeed, to increase our sample size there in both of our last two polls with the same methodology otherwise, so we can compare data over time.",
        "And broadly, what we see is two-thirds in Anbar say their own lives is going not just badly, but very badly; two-thirds expect their lives to get worse and their children's lives to get worse as well in the years ahead.",
        "Really, a broad negativity there borne of this lack of influence that Sunnis across Iraq, but particularly in Anbar feel, given the overthrow of Saddam Hussein those years ago.",
        "And also, we were talking about these alliances with the local sheikhs.",
        "According to your polling data, they are not tremendously popular either.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I would say I think an interesting to point to make is that in our survey, only 23 percent in Anbar expressed confidence in their local leaders, which is the second lowest that we saw in any province in Iraq, because it was only lower in Diyala province, another where the administration is talking about making some advances militarily.",
        "It seems there that the hearts and minds have been followed.",
        "I should say as well that not only is the problem in Anbar the lack of popularity, the rejection of United States, but also there's not a lot of progress that we see in terms of public attitudes.",
        "In the sense of reconciliation in Iraq itself, the enormous disapproval of the current government - 72 percent in Anbar say it's doing very badly.",
        "It's the worst rating for the national government of Iraq we saw anywhere in the country - 100 percent disapproval for the Shiite-led government for the prime minister, 82 percent in Anbar.",
        "Again, the most in the country say the national assembly is unwilling, in their view, to make the necessary compromises for peace.",
        "I wonder, Colonel MacFarland, if those results surprise you?"

        "MacFARLAND: Actually, they don't because you have to understand that when a pollster knocks on your door in Iraq, your response to them is perceived by most Iraqis as a life and death decision, you know?",
        "You don't know who that pollster is, who he talks to, who he's been intimidated by.",
        "So if you give the wrong answer to a pollster, certainly under Saddam's regime, so you have a lot of conditioning to overcome.",
        "And then, with al-Qaida recently driven from the area - but who knows if they're completely driven out - there may be still some folks sympathizing to - with al-Qaida still on the area.",
        "If you tell them that you don't like the coalition and you don't like the government and you are against Maliki, well, there's really no downside if you do that.",
        "Your family is going to be safe, because if you're an honest pollster and believe in democracy, well, that's your expression of your opinion, and that's okay.",
        "But if you're a different kind of pollster and you're just, you know, trying to get a sense for who to come around later to intimidate and you have - and you're going to pass results on to al-Qaida, then if you give the wrong kind of answer and say, yeah, I support the coalition, you could have a knock on your door later that night.",
        "And it won't be somebody with a clipboard, it may be somebody with a knife.",
        "So I am amazed that, you know, 30 percent of al-Anbaris had the courage to come forward and say, I support the coalition, because al-Qaida was only recently driven from that area.",
        "So, you know, kudos to those 30 percent who had that courage.",
        "And that, to me, I think, is a tremendous improvement.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Gary, is that something that you try to correct for in your polling?",
        "Well, the best we can do, for one, is we use - as I mentioned, when we started talking - local interviewers, where they are interviewers, are based in Anbar, trained in Anbar, Anbar natives, well-trained and well-supervised.",
        "But I think that vastly increases the comfort level.",
        "What you get when people are intimidated or afraid to cooperate in a survey is non-cooperation.",
        "They'll simply decline to participate.",
        "And we had really a quite good cooperation rate, 65 percent, in this survey, which is far better than we get in U.S.",
        "surveys.",
        "I think the data speak for themselves.",
        "It's a difficult country.",
        "There are difficult conditions there.",
        "I think freedom of expression is one thing that Iraqis have obtained.",
        "And when we compare our results across the country, there are Sunni and Shia areas across the country where we have different results than we see in Anbar.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "But the addition of some two battalions worth of Marines to al-Anbar, and along with a Marines expeditionary unit, almost the brigades' worth of combat power went to al-Anbar as part of the surge.",
        "And that gave the Marines expeditionary force out there a great deal more of tactical and operational flexibility, and they were able to exploit success.",
        "And rather than play Whac-A-Mole or just chase the enemy around al-Anbar, they were able to put enough pressure in enough pressure points to drive the enemy completely out of the province.",
        "Yet, that breakthrough, the political breakthrough that we were talking about earlier, that really happened before the surge.",

        "MacFARLAND: It did.",
        "The tribal awakening began in September 2006.",
        "And we were seeing steady progress - really a decline in enemy attacks began in right after Ramadan in November of 2006 and continued on a steady downward trend.",
        "But that trend - normally in the springtime, you begin to see a turnaround and the enemy comes back out in strength, and that never happened.",
        "It continued on a downward trend, and I think the surge was the reason for that.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Indeed.",
        "We have to understand, I think, that when the military measures its progress in Anbar, these reductions in attacks and the suicide bombs and the rest are the metric it uses.",

        "In the lives of ordinary Iraqis and ordinary residents of Anbar, there are a lot more elements that go into your basic sentiment about the U.S.",

        "The supply of basics such electricity, clean water - and we have a cholera outbreak now, as you know, in Iraq.",
        "Fifty-eight percent in Anbar rate their clean water supply not just as bad but as very bad; jobs: 61 percent, highly negative; medical care: 61 percent as well; local government: 72 percent.",
        "There is - they're doing a very bad job.",
        "Down the line, the supply of fuel, the ability to move about freely -significant majorities, in all cases, rating these not only negatively but extremely so, and that fuels this broader discontent that we see across the board.",
