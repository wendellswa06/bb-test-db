        "I mean, he said something that kind of got some people - well, he said a lot of things that got people's attention.",

        "What is he talking about there?",
        "He said that there need to be - that all guns sold in the country need to be smart guns.",
        "But as one of the moderators point out, there are already 300 million guns in circulation in the United States right now.",
        "What is he saying?",
        "He did talk about smart guns.",
        "These are guns that would only fire for their owner, so that if a child got ahold of it, if it was lost or stolen and theft and entered the black market, it couldn't be used.",
        "And he's saying the gun manufacturers could make these products now.",
        "They're not - they won't.",
        "They're the problem.",
        "You know, that's a that's a piece of it certainly, but I think it falls short of a comprehensive plan.",
        "And so finally, can you say - do most of these candidates have what you call a comprehensive plan?",
        "Or is it really as individual as we have just discussed?",
        "I mean, we've really - this is the one area in which we seem to really go on person-by-person, and they all seem to really have nuances there.",
        "You know, there's this consensus around universal background checks, consensus around renewing an assault weapons ban.",
        "But they haven't gone over that last mile.",
        "You know, again striking, though, just to hear candidates sort of interrupt each other and to say to the moderator, wait, wait, I want to talk about guns.",

        "But unlike sagebrush, which tends to burn every 50 to a hundred years, cheatgrass burns every five to 10, and it regrows faster after a fire.",
        "So more fire means more cheatgrass, and more cheatgrass means more fire.",
