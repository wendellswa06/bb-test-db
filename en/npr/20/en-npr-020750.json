        "Whether it buys dollars or sells the yuan directly to Chinese companies or does so through intermediaries, like local banks, the Bank of China determines the market price.",
        "By keeping the yuan tightly aligned with the dollar, China perpetuates the cost advantage it has over the United States as a manufacturing center.",
        "When the dollar weakens against the euro and the yen, the yuan weakens by roughly the same proportion.",
        "As a result, Chinese-produced goods remain cheap in this country.",
        "And perhaps more significantly, even if a sinking dollar makes US-produced dishwashers cheaper in Europe or Japan, it makes Chinese-produced dishwashers cheaper still."
