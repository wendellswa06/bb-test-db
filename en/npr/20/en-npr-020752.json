        "So far, the pace of overall price increases in the economy hasn't been infected by high oil prices, but there are signs that that's beginning to happen.",
        "I mean, last week in The Journal we reported that prices of Folgers coffee, Charmin's toilet paper, Kellogg's Rice Krispies and Kellogg's Pop Tarts all were up enough to give more profits to the companies that make them.",
        "Mr. Greenspan sees that and he doesn't want inflation to get out of hand, and he knows that that's a risk at a time when the economy is operating a little closer to full capacity than it has been.",
        "And we see all these energy prices which, of course, feed into the prices of other things.",
        "So we see the Fed a little more willing to raise interest rates and all--in order to hold down the price of Pop Tarts?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Mr. Greenspan wants to make sure that your kids can buy Pop Tarts at the same price that you can if he can do anything about it.",
        "He wants to avoid price gouging by the Kellogg folks.",
        "If you're the Fed chairman, would you be willing to risk a recession in order to avoid too much inflation?",
        "Fortunately, I'm not the Fed chairman.",
        "I don't think that Mr. Greenspan thinks there's a great risk of recession.",
        "What he says is `What is the bigger danger right now?",
        "That we have interest rates too low and we get inflation, or we have interest rates too high and we get a recession?",
        "And when he looks at that calculus, he sees inflation as a bigger worry and he's willing to settle for slightly slower growth as a consequence."

        "Is there a comparison between this period and, say, the late 1980s, sluggish growth for an extended period of time?",
        "There are often comparisons made to the 1970s when we had what was called `stagflation,' the twin evils of slow growth and high inflation.",
        "But really the conditions are quite different.",
        "We do have an increase in energy prices, but the US economy seems to be much less dependent on energy, especially imported oil, than it was back then.",
        "And also, the Fed and other central banks around the world are determined not to let inflation get out of control, and people seem to accept that.",
        "The Fed chairman made some of his most dire recent statements about the federal budget deficit.",
        "Do the people we just heard from in different parts of the country need to worry about the federal budget deficit?",
        "Yes.",
        "Mr. Greenspan is now returning to those old warnings; that the prospect for very big spending increases as the baby boom retires are very great, and taxes aren't sufficient to cover those.",

        "He has a remarkable record.",
        "In 18 years we've had only two recessions and inflation is lower now than it's been in a generation.",
