        "So yes, Frankenstein I think gets a really raw deal in the reputation department.",
        "We all think of Frankenstein's monster as this monosyllabic idiot from the movies.",
        "But actually, in Mary Shelley's original novel from 1818, Frankenstein's monster was more of a sensitive intellectual type.",
        "He read Plutarch and Goethe.",

        "Dracula - there's now a Dracula 2.0 in some minds.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, Bram Stoker named Count Dracula after Vlad Dracula, who was a notoriously bloodthirsty ruler from the 14th century in what is now Romania.",
        "His nickname is Vlad the Impaler because he did like to impale his enemies on wooden sticks.",
        "But that said, some Romanians are on a mission to show he had his good side.",
        "There's a recent museum exhibit in Romania that argued Vlad the Impaler was a victim of a Western European smear campaign.",
        "So yes, he was cruel, but so was every other ruler at the time.",
        "Plus, this I liked - Vlad was sort of, like, a medieval Bernie Sanders.",
        "He wanted to reclaim the country from the corrupt aristocracy.",
        "He was fighting the 1 percent.",
        "By impaling them one by one, you mean?",
        "(Laughter)."

        "And in England, in 1800s, sailors' wives believed that owning a black cat would protect their husbands when they were at sea, so everyone wanted a black cat.",
        "And there was a black cat shortage, and there was a literal black market in black cats.",

        "In fact, he's quite clever and entrepreneurial.",
        "And he almost outwitted the devil, so that's the Irish folktale.",
        "Jack tricked the devil into climbing a tree to get him an apple.",
        "And then Jack carved a cross on the tree trunks so the devil couldn't get down.",
        "So Jack says I'll take away the cross if you promise never to send me to hell.",
        "So they made a deal, but, of course, the devil being the devil, he found a loophole.",
        "So he didn't send Jack to hell, but Jack was consigned to walk the earth forever, holding a lantern to light his way.",
        "And by the way - this is important - the lantern was made of a turnip, not a pumpkin.",
        "So somewhere along the line, the turnip industry got really screwed.",
        "Have you ever opened the door and seen a trick of trick-or-treater dressed as B.J.",
