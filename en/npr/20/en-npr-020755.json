        "Lying here, they look like sad little porpoises with their tails cut off, a big gash under their fin.",
        "And you can see the tails are sliced off in kind of 90-degree angle cuts so that the traders can directly inspect the meat with their flashlights, and they're looking for the freshest, fattiest tuna that will fetch the highest price.",
