        "This guy's family has got $2.7 billion.",
        "And that's the whole point.",
        "It's why that's such a striking quote for someone to say that no one is above the law.",
        "The fact of the matter, in China, the Communist Party is above the law.",
        "The courts follow what the party says in any sort of politically sensitive case.",
        "There is no rule of law.",
        "And so how you actually solve this problem is very, very difficult, especially with a party that does not want to share power, that feels that it can police itself.",
        "But increasingly, if you talk to ordinary Chinese, they don't feel that way.",
        "They do - even by blocking the Times site, most people don't know that story, but they do know the story of many other officials who have done wrong, you know, have done bad things.",
        "And so there is, I think, an emerging crisis of confidence in the party, particularly around the issue of corruption.",
        "Well, there is also the issue of legitimacy.",
        "And in the past, what, 30 years as China has gone through this extraordinary economic development, legitimacy has been - improved living conditions for its people.",
        "We tend to think of China as an economic juggernaut.",
        "Today in that speech, the outgoing leader said we want to double people's incomes and double China's economy in the next 10 years.",
        "I'll be interested to see how he does that.",
        "There are whole number of reasons why that may be very hard to do.",
        "One is the old economic model that brought the country to this point, which has done - you know, if you look at Shanghai, the differences are extraordinary, how much has changed and how much the places improved in many ways, economically.",
        "But that model, which was built on cheap labor, exports to EU and the U.S., things like that, that's no longer the case anymore.",
        "Labor's expensive now in China.",
        "It's not cheap.",
        "The people in the U.S.",
        "and the EU have big financial crisis.",
        "They can't buy a lot of things anymore.",
        "So what China needs to do is change that model, and it's going to be a lot harder.",
        "That earlier model was, kind of, low hanging fruit.",
        "They're going to have to climb the value chain.",
        "They're going to have to become a lot more innovative.",
        "They're also going to have to take away the power of state on enterprises that control a large sector of the economy but aren't very efficient and are very closely tied to the Communist Party.",
        "So this next phase is not going to be as easy.",
        "I was listening back to some of the pieces that you've done in the past couple of months as we prepare for this broadcast.",
        "One of the things that China may have to change is the role of its banks.",
        "Banks like to take very few risks if possible, and that means investing in those big state-owned industries that have - well, they may not be spectacular returns anymore, but they are reliable.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The banks do extremely well.",
        "You and I could sit back and run those banks and be very, very wealthy, though, communist.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "The government sets the interest rates and so the banks can make a lot money.",
        "And if you're a Chinese person, you can't really get much of your capital out of the country.",
        "So where else are you going to put it?",
        "One of the problems with the banks is that they tend to invest in state-owned enterprises.",
        "It's kind of part of their job, and it's less risky.",
        "But most of the jobs in China are really produced by private enterprise, as they are here in the United States.",
        "And it's much harder for them to get capital.",
        "So people are, in many ways, feelings that the economy is out of whack in a number ways and that there need to be some serious changes.",
        "The government knows this, but there are now very strong vested interests in state-owned enterprises and the banks.",
        "And so getting that done is not going to be easy politically."

        "The over-capacity in the steel is extraordinary, and the debt now is over $400 billion.",
        "It's actually owned by steel companies largely to Chinese banks.",
        "And it's going to take years to work through that over-capacity.",

        "We really don't know who many of these people will be, what their policies would be.",
        "And it just seems like there's quite a distance between the rulers and the ruled.",
