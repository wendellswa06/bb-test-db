        "In the book, she talks about how much Bingley and Darcy - or her mom especially talks about how much Bingley and Darcy are worth, and I think Bingley was worth 5,000 a year, and Darcy was like 10,000 a year.",
        "So in dollars today, how much would that be?",
        "Well, that's a good question.",
        "I actually have that in the book, where I say in the case of Bingley, he's described as 4 to 5,000 a year.",
        "It'd be between about $250,000 to $300,000 annual income.",
        "Darcy would be double that, or a little more than double - 10,000 a year.",
        "And in his case, he also has an estate, which would be on top of his income.",
        "So you do get - I do provide those equivalents, though at the same time, they're not precise equivalents because, you know, it's not the exact same sort of economy, so certain things like goods tended to be more expensive then, but labor was very cheap.",
        "So a lot of these people had armies of servants in a way that people nowadays, even wealthy people, wouldn't have, but they often weren't able to buy as many things.",
        "But yes, there is - it's good to know that, because you wonder all right, what does that mean - £5,000 or £10,000?",
        "What does that mean in terms of today's money?"

        "Yeah, 4,000 or 5,000 a year…",
        "It does give you a sense.",
        "I mean, these are very wealthy people, especially Darcy.",
        "He would be one of the - you know, in the top probably .1 percent of the income of people in England at the time.",
        "Well, and plus because he would inherit his aunt's estate, too, because of it being patrilineal, you know, estate would go from - not from mother to her daughter, but wouldn't it go from her to him if something were to happen to his aunt's daughter?",
        "That is possible.",
        "I don't know about that.",
        "It's never spelled out.",
        "Sometimes it could, though it all depends on how - if there was another male relative who might be able to step in, but it is true that the nature of inheritance at the time generally favored men.",
        "And that's a critical fact, especially when it comes to the other major figure in the novel, Elizabeth, the one who ends up marrying Darcy.",
        "She's in a situation where her father has a very comfortable income, 2,000 a year.",
        "And so she lives very well, but the nature of the inheritance system, something called an entail that I explain in the book, means that if - because he hasn't had any male children, once he dies, all his income and the estate he has are all going to pass to somebody else, which means that his wife and his daughters are going to be left with almost nothing.",
        "So she's in this paradoxical situation of being someone who lives very comfortably right now, but is facing the possibility of terrible poverty, which in turn is something that really adds to the story because it shows her desperate situation and why it's so good for her to make a marriage with somebody like Mr. Darcy, and at the same time also shows how courageous she is in refusing an offer the first time she's asked because she doesn't admire him.",

        "I just wanted to say that I think the annotation is a great idea.",
        "It allows you to both on one side read the entire story without annotation if you so choose, and on the other side view the fluidity of how language evolved, in taking all in granted(ph) from Shakespearean times to when Jane Austin wrote to current, contemporary times.",
        "And I'll just comment to somebody who was on the line earlier, I think anybody who told you that more knowledge was unnecessary is a person is a person you shouldn't trust, and I'll take my comments off the air.",
        "All right, thanks very much for the call, Emmett.",
        "The language certainly evolves a great deal from Shakespeare's time to Austin's, and considerably from Austin's time to ours.",
        "That's right, and, of course, in some respects, it can be almost more deceptive with Austin because Shakespeare's language is so obviously alien that you kind of except that I'm going to have to figure out exactly what things mean.",
        "But Jane Austin's language, it's closer to ours, but sometimes that can lead you think oh, well therefore, there are almost no differences.",
        "And so a lot of words that are still used nowadays, you sort of just assume, well, that has the same meaning even though, in fact, the meaning may have shifted some.",

        "Reading a few years ago the annotated version of \"\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\"\" and found the additional information regarding historical people of the time, some of the references to where the (unintelligible) was on scientific knowledge, many, many other factors to be absolutely invaluable.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, actually, it refers to the distance covered under the ocean, not the depth, per se.",
        "A league, I believe, is on the order of something like six kilometers.",

        "Well, that's a tough one.",
        "In fact, much of the work in this wasn't just about researching and deciding what things could be said, but then deciding how they're going to be organized and figuring out how much to put in.",
        "I guess it's all, you know, I guess every work can use a little bit of a blue pencil to scratch things off, and that's always painful to do so, but you know, you can't put everything in there.",
        "And you just have to kind of play it by ear in terms of deciding, and inevitably, you know, there're going to be some things that some people may already know, but you try to put just what you think is most appropriate and what serves the story.",
        "And one thing I did in this is to try to make sure the annotations all do serve the story.",
        "Most of them are not very long, and they almost always refer very directly to what's being said in the novel.",
        "They're not meant to sort of stand alone or show of my knowledge.",
        "They're meant to help people with the novel, and that was always my guiding principle in deciding what to put in and what not to put in.",
