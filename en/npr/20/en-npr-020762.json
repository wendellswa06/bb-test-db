        "Another description of the information shared was that it was, quote, \"\"code word information,\"\" which doesn't sound unusual for spycraft.",
        "But what does it mean here?",
        "It's a way that you can talk about these things in which you refer to them but without actually knowing what they are.",
        "So if you have a code word for your fiefdom that you're working on and I have one for mine, you might know about the other person's work but not any detail about what it is.",

        "A lot of people remember the code name Curveball, who was the source for an Iraqi defector who gave intelligence to the United States about what he said was the weapons of mass destruction program there, intelligence that turned out to be faulty and was later debunked.",
        "But wait a minute.",
        "I wonder if that's all that's going on here because people still did find out about the little girl.",
        "They did find out a personal story.",
        "But they also found these statistics, and that made them less likely to give.",
        "Yeah, that's exactly right, Steve.",
        "So the question is even if the statistics aren't powerful as an emotional message, why are the statistics reducing people's emotional response to the little girl?",
        "So along with Daniel Vastfjall and Marcus Mayorga, Slovic's just finished a series of experiments that suggest it might not actually be about heart versus head, but about one set of feelings competing against another set of feelings.",
        "What feelings?",
        "Well, when Slovic tests the volunteers, they want to help the little girl because the anticipated will make them feel good.",
        "It gives them this warm glow.",
        "But when you tell them about the little girl and the millions of others who are suffering, you now trigger two different feelings.",
        "Wanting to help the little girl still produces the warm glow, but that feeling is contaminated by a bad feeling about the large number of people the volunteers aren't helping.",
        "So many millions of people are starving that there's nothing I can do to make a big difference in this problem.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Now, if the brain were a computer, these feelings wouldn't cancel each other out.",
        "We would still help the little girl even if we couldn't help everyone.",
        "But the brain isn't a computer.",
        "It's powerful at unconsciously integrating the different feelings we are experiencing.",
        "The bad feeling is diminishing the warm glow, and with it, it's reducing the generosity people feel toward the little girl.",
        "And this is a sad thing, Steve.",
        "People are declining to do what they can do because they're feeling bad about what they can't do.",
        "And Slovic thinks this might explain why fewer Americans might be donating to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.",
        "There's lots about the Ebola outbreak that triggers feelings of hopelessness - there's no cure, lots of people are going to get sick, lots of people who get sick are going to die.",
        "Here's Slovic again.",
        "It's really about the sense of efficacy, and if our brain works in ways that creates an illusion of non-efficacy, people could be demotivated by thinking, well, this is such a big problem, and is my donation going to be effective in any way?",
        "This is reminding me of studies of people's attitudes toward climate change, global warming.",
        "People get to thinking, this is such a vast problem that I can do nothing about, so I'll just ignore it."

        "What are journalists allowed to report on, and what are they not allowed to report on?",
        "The media environment in Zimbabwe has considerably degenerated in the past four to five years.",
        "Firstly, journalists are now required by law to register with the state-appointed media commission, and if you are not accredited by that commission you are not allowed to practice.",
        "Media publishers are also required to register with the state-appointed media commission.",
        "If they are not registered, they cannot continue publishing.",
        "The obvious effect of that is that, you know, if you do have the equipment, you already are an established company, and the media commission decides not to register you, you are basically out of business and cannot publish your newspaper.",
        "And it means that a journalist who has been practicing, once they are denied accreditation, they cannot continue publishing.",
        "And this applies mainly to independent media practitioners.",
        "And what the effect of it is right now is that we virtually have no independent media anymore in Zimbabwe.",
        "And what I've read in Zimbabwe is that there's a fair amount of intimidation, even if a lot of journalists are not necessarily convicted--that people are essentially harassed by the government, thrown in jail for a couple of days, and then charges are later dropped.",
        "That is quite correct.",
        "We've had a number of journalists locked up, arrested--locked up for a couple of days, taken to court, and at the end of the day nothing ever comes out of, say, those arrests.",
        "So the arrest and detention has been used more to punish than because there is a belief that there is a criminal offense.",
        "And naturally, that has a chilling effect that journalists will start self-censoring, or not writing stories that they think might result in them being arrested and locked up and/or tortured, as happened with some journalists in the past.",
        "Couple of days in jail doesn't sound so bad.",
        "It doesn't sound so bad at all if you ought to be in jail, but freedom is one of the most precious rights, as you well know, and to be thrown in jail even for 10 minutes when you ought not to be in jail is, obviously, completely unacceptable.",
        "But those who are familiar with Zimbabwean jails will know that a couple of days in Zimbabwean jail could very well be a sentence in that you don't know what you will come out of when you are in that jail.",
        "One of the two journalists who were arrested in April, when he came out of jail in Zimbabwe, he had actually to be hospitalized for a number of weeks when he got back to the United Kingdom because of the fever that he caught from being beaten by the bugs in jail.",
        "So it isn't simply just a couple of days in jail.",
