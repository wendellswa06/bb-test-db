        "We were able to go to court to get an order to stop him being deported, and we challenged the deportation order.",
        "Despite the fact that there was a court order saying he shouldn't be deported--he had lived in Zimbabwe for years prior to that; he had permanent residence, he had a home, he had a wife, he had pets--the state decided in May 2003 that they wanted him out, and they called him to go to the Immigration department.",
        "After a couple of days of dodging them, we finally decided that we would go to the immigration office.",
        "We had been assured that they would not disrespect the court order, but when we got to the Immigration department, he basically was grabbed and thrown into a car, his face covered, and he was driven to a destination that we didn't know.",

        "We served that at the Immigration department.",
        "They did not comply.",
        "We served that order because it required that he be produced within a few hours.",

        "They came to court and said they were fetching him, and they left and never quite came back with him.",
        "We got another order from the court; ride to the airport, because we had received information that he was being held at the airport, and just as we arrived, they--we saw him being taken through the last round of the immigration procedures, and that is when we basically ran to try and stop the captain.",
        "We wanted to serve the order on the captain of the plane in order to stop him deporting him, but we were unable to do so.",

        "There have been attempts to intimidate you, as well.",
        "Well, there are attempts to intimidate all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe, and we've formed alliances here and there, but it is not always possible to have people with you because some of the arrests happen at night, and if you have to go out on your own at night it can get dangerous, and you always try to get one or two police to come along with you.",
        "And that attempt to intimidate will always be there.",
        "We just have a minute left, but I did want to ask you--in a country where we're deluged with media, we sometimes forget how important free media can be.",
        "Why is it so important to you in Zimbabwe?",
