        "So as NPR's Wendy Kaufman reports, there were a lot of questions today about whether the deal makes sense.",
        "This is Microsoft's most expensive acquisition, and it's one Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is excited about.",
        "By bringing together the best of Microsoft and the best of Skype, we will empower people around the world with new technologies that should bring them closer together.",
        "Ballmer, along with Skype CEO Tony Bates, spoke at a news conference this morning.",
        "The deal will combine the world's largest software company, Microsoft, with one of the leading Internet communications companies.",
        "Indeed, the Skype brand name is so strong that \"\"to skype\"\" has become a verb.",

        "Again, Steve Ballmer.",
        "This Skype acquisition is entirely consistent with our ambitious, forward-looking, irrepressible nature.",

        "So for example, you could be at work talking on a phone, and you could Skype out to a customer and have a video conference with a customer right from your office desk.",
        "And that's a very powerful thing.",
        "Businesses do some of that now, but the combination of Microsoft and Skype could allow them to do it in an easy, secure and readily managed way and in a way that companies might be willing to pay for it.",
        "Right now, just a tiny fraction of Skype's users pay anything at all, and the company has not produced much in terms of net profit.",
        "While Microsoft and Skype say there's lots of revenue potential in this deal, many analysts think Microsoft overpaid.",

        "They see the Western lifestyle as very decadent and the woman, who is the symbol of family honor, is in their opinion the weak link, the one who's most vulnerable to being seduced by the West.",
        "So that fear of Western contamination has led to separate parallel enclaves in Germany that are often more conservative than their Turkish homeland is.",

        "But yes, they've expanded considerably, and the protesters are now demanding the resignation of President Yanukovych.",
        "They want early presidential elections.",
        "They want early parliamentary elections.",
        "So, it's an extreme position.",
        "So you have these two sides that are, I guess you could say, dug into their respective positions, and there's very little common ground between them.",
        "They're trying to hold talks, but obviously, if one side is demanding the president resign and the other side is saying the president's going nowhere, there's not a whole lot of room for compromise.",
        "And that's leading a lot of observers to think that this is going to go on for a while, and, in fact, could escalate even further.",
        "Journalist David Stern was speaking to us from Kiev, the capital of Ukraine.",
