        "Big family news for all of us - distant relatives, mind you - ancestors, actually.",
        "That'll be uncle homo erectus and cousin homo habilis.",
        "Who?",
        "Those two earlier species of human ancestors were thought to have evolved in succession.",
        "New fossil discoveries in Kenya prove they didn't.",
        "They coexisted.",
        "The research was published yesterday in the journal Nature.",
        "Dr. Susan Anton is a co-author along with Meave and Louise Leaky and Fred Spoor of University College London.",
        "Dr.",
        "Anton, welcome, and tell us about these bones.",
        "How old are they?",
        "Well, the homo habilis is the youngest specimen that has been found so far and it's about 1.44 million years old.",
        "The homo erectus specimen that we're talking about is about 1.5 million years old.",
        "And what is it that's surprising to you, to find out that these two ancestors lived at the same time?",
        "It has been previously thought that there was a unilineal or single line relationship with homo habilis, slowly giving rise to homo erectus, that then slowly gave rise to us.",
        "This would imply that homo habilis had gone extinct through most of the history of homo erectus, and so to find the two of them co-existing for nearly half a million years was not what had been predicted.",
        "When you say that they co-existed, would they have interbred perhaps?",
        "Well, we can feel pretty certain that they, in fact, didn't interbreed because otherwise their gene pools would have mixed and then anatomically they would have ended up looking very similar to one another, and we wouldn't be able to talk about separating the fossils into two groups: homo habilis versus homo erectus.",
        "However, it is possible that they did live somewhat side-by-side in the same environment at the same time, dividing that environment up in different ways, maybe eating slightly different things in each group, and maybe behaving slightly differently to keep themselves separate."

        "Is this pretty big news in the world of anthropology?",
        "I mean, it sounds as though you're substantially rearranging the history of human development.",
        "Well, I think what we're doing is we're adding some complexity to that history and that's something that in a field that is dependent on new fossils being found you always make your best hypotheses and then something new comes along and kind of turns that on its head.",
        "So nobody had quite anticipated that we would have homo habilis lasting this long, nor had we quite anticipated that we would have homo erectus being this small in size - usually we had thought of homo habilis as really tiny, homo erectus getting bigger in body and more like ourselves.",
        "And this new skull that we're talking about is really tiny.",
        "You can think about it as maybe the size of about a grape fruit, I would never do this but I could palm it, you know, much like a basketball - and I don't have particularly big hands.",
        "So it's very - it's tiny.",
        "And that's one of the things that is very important about it, is that it has all the characteristics of homo erectus and yet it is a very, very tiny head compared to what we normally think about homo erectus as.",
        "And that means there was a lot of size variation within homo erectus.",
        "Maybe it was child?",
        "What the allegation is is that portions of the government - the security services, the police - did not do enough in advance to alert the Christian community, to alert hotels, that they could be targets.",
