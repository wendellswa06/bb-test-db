        "A jury ruled in Ledbetter's favor and she was awarded $360,000 in back pay and damages.",
        "But yesterday the Supreme Court by a 5-to-4 vote overturned the jury's verdict.",
        "Noting that the Civil Rights Act imposes a 180-day deadline on most claims, the court said that an employee is not entitled to recover for anything that occurs before that cut-off.",
        "Writing for the court majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that by setting the 180-day deadline, Congress clearly meant to protect businesses from having to defend themselves against stale claims of discrimination that are long passed.",
        "Joining Alito and the majority were Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas.",
        "The dissenters, led by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, noted that it often takes years for employees to figure out pay disparities, and even small disparities when piled on each other year after year can add up to large sums overtime.",
        "Congress understood that, the dissenters contended, and never intended the 180-day deadline to prevent claims based on an accumulated wrong.",
        "In blunt terms, Ginsburg said it's now up to Congress to fix the statute if it doesn't like the court's interpretation.",
        "Wade Henderson, director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, said that given the addition of Justice Alito to the court after the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, yesterday's ruling was a not unexpected disappointment.",
        "There is a silver lining.",
        "The problem of statutory construction can be remedied.",
        "And I think the civil rights community is going to be pressing aggressively to have Congress fix the problem.",
        "Robin Conrad, general counsel for the U.S.",
        "Chamber of Commerce, said the business community sees no need to change the existing law.",
        "I think the balance and the fairness occurred a long time ago.",
        "I don't think any tweaking here would be at all fair.",
        "Civil rights leaders point to 1991 as their model.",
        "That year Congress, by large bi-partisan majorities, passed the Civil Rights Restoration Act, which reversed a bunch of Supreme Court decisions handed down by a court with a then-new conservative majority.",
        "This time, though, could be different, with business pushing back and Congress more closely divided.",
        "The new conservative majority was so unfazed about that possibility yesterday that for the first time in 15 years a majority opinion cited as precedent one of those Supreme Court decisions reversed by the 1991 Civil Rights Restoration Act."

        "Ever since 1701, when the Brits put their religious wars behind them, there has been an ironclad rule - the monarch of England is of the Church of England.",
        "If a royal wants to convert to Catholicism that would mean stepping out of the line of succession.",
        "Well now, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown says he's looking to reform that restriction as well as another one - the preference given to princes over princesses.",
        "Joining us to talk about this from London is Simon Hoggart of The Guardian newspaper, welcome back.",
        "Hello.",
        "The prime minister is talking about revising the 1701 Act of Settlement.",
        "Is it really time yet to do that?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "To 1701, it might just be yes.",
        "It all dates back - and like all things involving the British constitution it becomes completely wild and crazy at the very early stage - but it dates back to Henry the VIII more than hundred years before.",
        "He had a fight with the Pope about getting divorced from one of his wives.",
        "Therefore he decided to set up his own church called the Church of England and bizarrely ever since that time the monarch of England, or Britain as it now is, is the head of the church.",
        "So of course you couldn't have them being involved in a rival church.",
        "At any moment, you could have Queen joining the church of scientology or the Mormons or anything else.",
        "So it does seem a little bit odd but these are such fast changing times that having decided that it would make a rather nice gesture to the very many Roman Catholics who live in Britain - it would be like saying you're fully inclusive, you're part of the family like having, I might say, a black president just to take an example at random.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I see.",
        "So what you're saying is that there could be someone sitting on the throne who is a Roman Catholic and would that person then still be the titular head of the Church of England.",
        "Well, that's what not been sorted out and that's what's going to take a lot of time and you can bet there will be a lot of conservative old traditionalists who say, no, no, we can't possibly do that.",
        "The monarch is the head of the Church of England, nothing will ever change that, there can't possibly a Roman Catholic.",
        "So Gordon Brown can say well that's completely irrelevant, we haven't had a Catholic in the family for a very long time.",
        "But interestingly, one of the Queen's grandsons, Peter Phillips, did marry a Roman Catholic woman and she did indeed change her faith - nominally I suppose - when she got married a year or so back."

        "How would that, say, upset the current line of succession to the throne?",
        "They're getting ready for the day.",
        "Well, maybe it was.",
        "And that was one of our first thoughts, and we carefully looked at that using CT scans and other things, and it actually turns out that in terms of all the developmental indicators, the things that tell us whether an individual is finished growing, that this individual was at the very end of its growth.",
        "So if you were thinking in human terms, maybe about 18, 19 years old.",
        "And by that time humans are completely grown in terms of the size of their cranium, at least.",
        "When you first started discussing this with your colleagues, what's been the reaction?",
        "You know, it's been a predictable, I think, range of reactions.",
        "People are very excited about the fossils.",
        "The new homo erectus skull is very, very complete - more complete than anything we've had before and very, very tiny, and it depends a little bit on how people think about species and how to divide things up into species, whether they want to call this something completely new or whether they want to call this all one species or not.",
        "So there's been a range, and it always takes us a little while to assimilate new information and to see what, you know, sort of the main line is going to be coming out of it.",

        "International diplomats will gather this week in Geneva in hopes of picking up where they left off last week in talks about Iran's nuclear program.",
        "Those previous high-level negotiations came very close to a deal but ended with an objection by the French delegation, which claimed the proposal did not do enough to restrict Iran's nuclear capabilities.",

        "Not as close as you would expect them to be if you look at the level of seriousness of the negotiations.",
        "People, I guess like other people across the world, have grown tired of these talks, of them always failing.",
        "Still, there is a sense that this time things are a little bit different.",
        "And when you talk to the greengrocer or to your hairdresser, they feel that because of this election of new moderate President Hassan Rouhani, there is a chance that Iran's leaders will be a bit more flexible in these talks and that that could lead to some kind of a breakthrough.",
        "There's a suggestion here in the U.S.",
        "that Iran is coming closer to the negotiating table now because the years of economic sanctions are finally taking their toll, that that is the primary driver to getting a deal done.",

        "Well, I spoke to a guy recently who built buses here in the city of Hamadan.",
        "It's about 350 kilometer south of Tehran.",
        "And he described to me how his business had flourished 10 years ago, how he produced more and more buses with parts that he would buy from China.",
        "Then he would go to the bank around the corner of his office and make the payments to his suppliers.",
        "But now the production went down by almost 70 percent.",
        "He's rarely making any buses.",
        "He had to lay off over 100 people.",
        "And when he goes to the bank, try and pay to his Chinese suppliers, the door is shut for him because Iranian banks cannot transfer money anymore because of the sanctions.",
        "Well, this little story in a nutshell tells you what Iranian people are facing.",
        "Naturally, people feel that the sanctions are destroying them.",
        "So, talks are supposed to pick up again this coming week.",
        "You've been following all the machinations of this.",
        "Who has got to concede what in order to break this impasse?",
        "Well, if you just take a step back and look at it very simply, what the West should do is recognize what Iran calls its sovereign right to enrichment of uranium, which would mean that the Iranians within their own borders could control the entire fuel circle that leads to either nuclear energy or - and this is, of course, what concerns the West - to a nuclear weapon.",
        "Well, what the Iranians should do is to agree that their nuclear program will be so monitored to such a level that the Western and world powers will be convinced that Iran is actually not making a nuclear weapon.",
        "Now, if you get into the details of what such an agreement should look like, that's where all the problems start.",
        "So, even if there is a breakthrough in the upcoming talks, we must remember that this will probably an interim agreement, which kind of speaks about the broad lines but not about the fine details of monitoring, of the way the Iranians should limit their nuclear program.",
        "And then we reach the new phase in which all the negotiating partners have to go back to their own respective Congress or parliament to see how hard-liners in, for instance, the United States and Iran feel about this.",
        "So, the only thing that can happen is we have a first step to a new form of negotiating to enter an agreement but not an overall solution."
