        "And that's the source of the tension for Democrats in Congress.",
        "About 59 percent of Democrats support opening impeachment hearings.",
        "But that is down 12 points among Democrats since January, which is really interesting.",

        "They're understanding that impeachment in the House does not equal removal by the Senate.",

        "Yes.",

        "And also, another main question here is was adding this question to the 2020 census, in this current political climate - was that a constitutional decision?",
        "Was that a decision that could have harmed the government's ability to count every person in the country as the Constitution requires every 10 years?",

        "And could this lead to communities, especially households with non-citizens - including unauthorized immigrants - from being counted in the 2020 census?",
        "And, Hansi, the Supreme Court often takes time to make decisions, we should say.",
