        "We have been planning to withdraw this aid, and we're in the process of doing that.",
        "But that date, January 31, today - that wasn't right, and we shouldn't have said that.",
        "We're still phasing this aid out, but for the time being, people on the island can and will continue to be able to get this help if they need it by continuing to go to the warehouses that we have across the island."
