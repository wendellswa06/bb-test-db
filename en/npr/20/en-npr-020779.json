        "So, Joe, you know, there are a lot of murder stories, and there are a lot of controversial trials out there all the time.",
        "Why, back in 1993, 1994, did you pick this one to make a documentary about?",
        "Well, one of the fascinating things about the journey of this three films over two decades that Bruce Sinofsky - the co-filmmaker - and I undertook is that when we first went down - we actually arrived in West Memphis, Arkansas, within days of the arrests, embedded ourselves in the community for about eight months prior to the start of the trials.",
        "And frankly, we went down thinking we were making a film about guilty teenagers, because the press reports coming out of West Memphis, Arkansas were as if this was an open-and-shut case with a confession, with - on the scale of one to 10 - the police and chief investigator said on the scale of one to 10, it's an 11.",
        "And so the, you know, what sent us down was actually Sheila Nevins clipping an article.",
        "Sheila's the head of documentaries at HBO.",
        "And we all talked about the idea, wow, how could three teenagers be so rotten that they could do such a thing?",
        "Let's go explore disaffected youth.",
        "The great irony, of course, is that within a few months, we realized that something was quite wrong here, that the evidence was quite weak, that the defendants were very credible in their maintenance of innocence.",
        "And I guess, even then, we still had the naive belief it would work it - you know, it would work itself out at trial.",
        "And the other thing that happened to you in this - we're talking about 18 years ago.",
        "There was - there would be no way that you could imagine 18 years ago that 18 years later, this will still be part of your life's work.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No. It's - the amount of problems in this case and the inability for people to admit that they made a mistake is just mindboggling and has compounded over the years.",
        "But, you know, when we started feeling like these guys might be innocent, we still thought at the trial everything would work itself out.",
        "And that trial just was jaw-dropping in its - you know, the country was kind of coming off of a satanic hysteria, fear of satanic cults..."

        "Well, take a minute and tell us the story of the convictions, very briefly, why these three boys were picked up as the killers.",
        "Well, three eight-year-olds were found in a wooded area off the interstate in West Memphis, Arkansas, in a creek, in a bayou.",
        "And they had been hogtied, and they had wounds on their bodies that we now know some of those wounds - I mean, these kids were obviously murdered, but some of these wounds were horrific.",
        "We now know that those wounds were caused by post-mortem animal predation.",
        "You know, the animals found these bodies after they were dumped in this site.",
        "But at the time, those wounds were attributed to satanic ritual by three local teenagers.",
        "The alleged ringleader was a guy named Damien Echols who, you know, dressed in black and likes Metallica music.",
        "You know, that type of thing, but...",
        "He looked the part, of course.",
        "He looked the part.",
        "And this - but there was virtually no physical evidence linking these guys to the crime.",
        "And it was literally Metallica lyrics and Stephen King novels, you know, being introduced into the trial as evidence that these guys are twisted, demonic killers, and it was jaw-dropping.",
        "Well, after many, many questions were raised about the evidence, and it's a very, very tangled tale, last August, what happens?",
        "Well, after, you know, major, major investigations, you know, Peter Jackson who has since made himself a public figure on this - during a big chunk of this time, you know, Peter, you know, kept a low profile.",
        "But he was paying for - Peter Jackson, the filmmaker, had seen \"\"Paradise Lost,\"\" was very moved by it.",
        "And he and his partner, Fran Walsh, decided to get involved and started paying for an investigation that led to some huge investigatory breakthroughs.",
        "And the Arkansas Supreme Court had ordered that there would be an evidentiary hearing in December of 2011, and the state of Arkansas, I think, feared that scenario.",
        "It was the first positive movement for the West Memphis Three in this case in 18 years.",
        "And in lieu of going through with that evidentiary hearing, they released these guys on a - in a rarely used legal maneuver called an Alford plea, in which these guys plead guilty to lesser charges.",
        "In other words, the capital murder charges, you know, Echols was on death row and the other two were life without parole, you know.",
        "So the death sentence was vacated.",
        "The life sentences were vacated, and they plead guilty to lesser charges of first degree murder while still maintaining their innocence.",
        "All right.",
        "I...",
        "That's what the Alford plea is all about.",
        "And I - what sense is that?",
        "So in other words, they're saying, we're not guilty.",
        "We plead guilty.",
        "And the state says, we know you're guilty.",

        "It allows the state of Arkansas, basically, to save face because by pleading guilty - well, what's in it for the West Memphis Three is they get to - they end 18 years of wrongful imprisonment of this nightmare of incarceration, and it's a very imperfect ending.",
        "But if I was on death row, being treated the way Echols was treated, I would have taken the deal too.",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
