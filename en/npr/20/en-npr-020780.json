        "Was it a way to get out?",
        "Well, the only reason that I took the deal was to save Damien.",
        "You know, that was the only thing offered to me by the state after having to spent 18 years there in prison for a crime I didn't commit.",
        "But I was willing to stay a little bit longer, you know, to fight the good fight, you know, to go to trials.",
        "I have wonderful attorneys now who are, as Joe pointed out, you know, they've been well-funded for DNA testing and other forensic technology testing be done and things like that.",

        "Of course.",
        "Even though one day spent there was an injustice.",
        "One more day is an injustice, and I deserve nothing than be out right now, but I ought to keep on fighting, you know?",
        "And, in fact, I turned a deal down at first and - but, you know, I was told Jessie had taken the deal.",
        "Damien had taken the deal, and the only way the deal would be good is if all three of us took the deal.",
        "The state was not going to permit, you know, me to continue fighting the charges there and fight, you know, and eventually win the trial and sue them for wrongful commission.",
        "That's not what they wanted, you know.",
        "It's like Joe said earlier, you know, they knew this upcoming evidentiary hearing was going to be egg in their face.",
        "All right.",
        "They knew they were going to lose and have to release us, and, you know, lose all this taxpayer money on funding the re-hearings and a retrial eventually and then top it all off with a civil suit.",

        "But as filmmakers, you became part of the story in quite fascinating ways.",
        "Ultimately, I believe, the judge made a decision not to let cameras back in later in the courtroom, and the arrangements that you had with defense attorneys became material in - later in the process when it became a negative, a liability, it appears, for the defendants, that those attorneys were - had a deal with you and an arrangement with you.",
        "It became an issue that you were paying money to the families, all six families involved, the families of the victims and the families of the accused, in the form of honoraria.",
        "And so, was that a part - a role in this story that you had hoped not to have happened?",
        "In other words, did you want to stay on the outside and not become part of the story?",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "You know, I mean, we come from a classic cinema verite tradition, where we are supposed to observe events but not change them.",
        "And over time, the films, you know, definitely became part of the story, and, you know, it raises a lot of, you know, a lot of interesting philosophical questions about what the role of the documentarian is.",
        "And we definitely went from initially going down as observers to advocates.",
        "And, you know, where is the line between journalism and advocacy?",
