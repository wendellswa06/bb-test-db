        "What's it mean to slow China's growth in emissions rather than cut them?",
        "Well, China's plan calls for a cut in what's called carbon intensity and that means the amount of greenhouse gases they emit as measured against economic output.",
        "And because China's economy is growing at a robust rate, it could rise.",
        "For example, it could grow fourfold in the coming decades and that means that emissions could more than double.",

        "That's because Logan for the past two years has implemented a behavior profiling technique designed to detect subtle cues, clues that terrorists and criminals could display.",
        "The TSA has announced plans to train screeners at 40 other airports in the technique, looking at subconscious gestures, facial expressions and analyzing answers to simple questions.",
        "Many of you are traveling during this holiday week.",
        "Let us know how you feel about behavior profiling.",

        "Well, behavior pattern recognition actually is a trademark phrase by a gentleman who used to be the head of security at Israel's Ben Gurion Airport.",
        "And it's--you used the word `profiling'; that's sort of a tricky word.",
        "It's really looking at the way people act in an airport setting or any setting and trying to detect anomalies in their behavior.",
        "You know, the most glaring one would be--is someone wearing a heavy wool coat in the summertime.",
        "Others might be does someone look like they're scoping or surveilling an airport, or do people look unreasonably nervous?",
        "If you ask them, `Hey, how you doing?",
        "Where are you flying today?",
        "and they can't answer that question or they don't know what their flight number is, things that maybe indicate that someone isn't at an airport necessarily to fly.",
        "You know, my first reaction to this is, gosh, I better not have four cups of Starbucks before I go through the screening line.",
        "Right, right.",
        "Well, they--and people get that question a lot.",
        "How can you discern whether someone's a nervous flier?",
        "'Cause some people are nervous about flying as opposed to being nervous because they're going to blow up an airplane.",
        "And the TSA and the people who have done this insist that there is a difference between someone who is a nervous flier and someone who's nervous because they're a criminal.",
        "Some of it has to do with how someone interacts with law enforcement.",
        "You know, another classic sign of someone who's up to no good would be someone who avoids eye contact with law enforcement or is maybe afraid or reluctant to interact.",
        "You know, a police gets on an elevator and suddenly--you know, most times when you see a police officer, you're automatically inclined to look at the person because they're an authority figure.",
        "But a lot of people--a hint is considered if someone looks down, looks away, avoids eye contact.",
        "I had a person at Logan who works for the TSA tell me that he watched a tape of three of the hijackers go through Dulles Airport, and he said that he could tell by watching them go through the security checkpoint because they all looked down and none of them looked at the security guard who was operating the metal detector.",
        "He said, `That to me was a clue.",
        "Now he didn't say, you know, `If I was there, I would have pulled these guys over,' because that's all--that's hindsight that you can't rely on.",
        "But there are behaviors, and there's also--there's a body of thought in psychology that says you can tell when people are lying.",
        "There have been some studies done in labs, mind you, not in the field, that have shown, for example, Secret Service agents are very good at telling whether people are lying, which, if you think about it, makes sense 'cause that's sort of what they're trained to do.",
        "They're trained to observe people, and based on looking at people, does something not look right?",
        "What kinds of questions are these screeners asking people?",
        "It's really incredibly benign.",
        "I watched it happen at Logan for about an hour, and the questions are really `How you doing?",
        "Where you headed?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Why are you going there?",
        "It's really small talk, basically.",
        "And, you know, once you set up a profile, any kind of profile, can't you just train yourself to not, you know, fall into it?",
        "That's the good question.",

        "Some of the question is how well-trained are terrorists, and some of the terrorists who have been used are--they're not terribly well-trained.",
        "A lot of them are, you know, people who aren't highly educated.",
