        "OK.",
        "J.R.: And you use a lot of--you establish norms just like the gentleman was talking about, through just benign conversation, and then you can pick up different behavioral clues--you know, the trained individual can--and determine whether or not the person is being deceptive.",
        "Thanks for your call, J.R.",
        "And let me ask you, Thomas Frank, how is it being used?",
        "I mean, it's also being used by police officers.",
        "Our caller just said he's sort of using it on his own.",
        "I mean, what other organizations are using this?",
        "Well, it's being used--the roots of this, actually, I believe, are in Israel at the airport there, where there's very aggressive questioning which could never be done in the US.",
        "It's just a different attitude and atmosphere.",
        "Because of privacy concerns?",
        "Because of privacy; because there's no Fourth Amendment in Israel.",

        "People have many fewer rights.",
        "The questioning in Israel is much more aggressive.",
        "It's been used in the--I was actually questioned 10 years ago at Heathrow Airport.",
        "Some police officer came and said, `Hey, where are you going?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "'cause I was sitting in there with a backpack.",
        "And it's been--it really started in the US with the Massachusetts State Police, who are the police agency at Logan Airport.",

        "And the TSA has used it for the last two or three years at five airports in Boston and Minneapolis; Providence, Rhode Island; Portland and Bangor, Maine.",
        "And the American Civil Liberties Union, other groups, aren't particularly excited about this behavior profiling.",
        "Why?",
        "Right.",
        "The concern is--I think it goes to the fact that one's perception of behavior can be influenced by one's own prejudices.",
        "So there have been studies, for example, that show you take a bunch of people and show them photos of both whites and minorities, and white people who are subjects in the study are much more likely to assign criminal and nefarious intent to blacks who are depicted than blacks are.",
        "So I may say as a white person, `Huh, this person looks suspicious,' and it's not--the concern is that police will not be reacting to the behavior, but will be reacting to the person's race.",

        "China is saying the average Chinese person or Chinese business will be using energy more efficiently if this plan becomes real, but still because China's economy is growing and when the economy grows, you use more energy, China will pollute more than ever before.",
        "Well, we have to see what China's actual growth levels are.",
        "Now there's two things at stake here.",
        "One is how much energy they use to produce that economic growth, and the other part is how much carbon they emit to get there.",
        "They are managing to use less energy, but because they are so reliant on coal and because they are in a phase of heavy industry right now - emitting an awful lot of carbon, and that is probably set to continue.",
        "Is there something of a shell game going on here, then?",
        "I don't profile, yeah.",
        "No, it's an excellent question, and I think that's also true in some Arab cultures, that looking people directly in eye is seen as a challenge.",
        "It's a good question, and I don't know the honest answer, but my guess is that, you know, in the US, in this climate, that that would be part of the training would be to understand that different responses--and the other thing is it's not just--this behavior detection isn't based on just a quick snapshot.",
        "It's a process whereby--it's sort of like resolving an alarm if, you know, you walk through a metal detector and set off an alarm, where there's a process for figuring out whether you're a threat or whether you're not, and it's a strange sort of thing.",
        "If you trigger a psychological alarm in a screener's head, they will go through a series of questions and protocols, so that if it turns out that, well, you're not looking at me because that's the way you do it, then hopefully they can resolve that.",
        "Thomas Frank is a reporter for USA Today.",

        "The most well-known approaches to helping poor countries have to do with money, giving aid and with improving their access to markets; the trade approach.",
        "And those things are important, but what we concluded in our piece is that what's also important is to tremendously broaden the agenda.",
        "The evidence is that, if you're looking for long-term growth, a real transformation of societies, we've got to recognize that aid can only help.",
        "It can't be the fundamental driving force.",

        "So we need to understand why is it that a country like Vietnam, which actually had a trade embargo against it from the US until 1994, has done so well, whereas other countries--we use the example of Nicaragua--have not done so well, despite apparent advantages.",
        "So how can the wealthy nations then best help the poor countries to help themselves?",
        "Well, aid, as I said, can make a difference.",
        "Certainly, it can matter for many countries to have better access to our markets.",
        "The fact that we have these agricultural subsidies which impede the ability of countries in the poorest parts of the world to sell their agricultural products to us, it does matter.",
        "But what needs to be emphasized more, including at the United Nations in New York next month, is a whole set of other issues where the rich world can be, and is, doing harm to the poor world.",
