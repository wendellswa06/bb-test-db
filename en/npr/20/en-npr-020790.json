        "They just recognize you and they get a buzz or something, you know?",
        "So you can't take it as truth.",

        "Yeah.",
        "You know, that movie where you just wake up again and again and again.",
        "It's the same conversation every time.",
        "And, yeah, you feel kind of trapped in these conversations that haven't changed in decades, it seems.",
        "We've seem locked into a pattern, and we've got to find a way to break out of this somehow.",
        "Yet, climate scientists say the evidence is more and more convincing.",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "It's not that, you know, people misunderstand this to say we're not compromising the science.",
        "The climate science, I would argue is very, very clear that, you know, we're warming the climate.",
        "We are responsible for that.",
        "It's not conceding that ground but rather asking maybe a different question, rather than hitting people over the head and saying, look, you're causing climate change.",
        "We need to change this.",
        "It's instead asking a different set of questions, like how do we make American - the American economy more competitive, how do we keep jobs in this country, how do we be more secure, that kind of thing, approaching these questions from a different angle.",
        "In Minnesota, where I live, for example, we spend about $20 billion, with a B, on energy every year.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We don't have any oil or natural gas or coal or uranium up here, so we have to think about this as a kind of local economic issue, perhaps, saying to people, well, don't worry about climate change so much, but how do we keep $20 billion from leaving the state of Minnesota?",
        "Wouldn't you rather keep it here?",
        "And when you - I think when you approach people with those different kinds of angles to a similar kind of question, you suddenly can break the conversation open and, you know, really explore common ground, whereas just rehashing the same old climate debate again and again and again, just gets us locked in to somewhere we're just never seem to go anywhere.",
        "Well, have you had conversations with climate skeptics that moved into positive territory?",
        "Oh, yeah, absolutely.",
        "As something that - it just - this is something that seems to happen a lot where, yeah, you might go to a room of people who are somewhat skeptical about climate change or other environmental issues, not just climate.",
        "And when you walk in, instead of saying you're the bad guy and I'm here to tell you what's wrong with you, if instead you say, well, how can I help your business be more profitable, how can we help America be more competitive, how can we make our country more secure, you go in as a friend, not as an, you know, opponent.",
        "And suddenly, the conversation changes, or you can have a whole new tenor to it.",
        "But even - there's a funny story a few years ago.",
        "I lived in Wisconsin for a long time, and I had a neighbor who's just a regular blue-collar guy, drove a pickup truck, you know, just a good guy, and he watched me come out of my house one day, and he said to me, hey, John, you work at the university, don't you?",
        "And I said sure, sure, and he said, well, you work in environmental issues, right?",
        "I'm like, yeah, I do.",
        "And he said, well, do you work on climate change?",
        "And I said, yeah, I do, actually.",
        "It's part of what I work on.",
        "And he looked around, and he leaned in.",
        "He wanted to make sure we weren't being overheard, and he said to me, well, can you let me in on the secret?",
        "I want to hear about this big conspiracy.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "And I said what are you talking about?",
        "He said, no, no, on Rush Limbaugh this morning, I heard how the scientists and the U.N.",
        "and, you know, Greenpeace or whoever it was, are trying to take over the world's governments and shut down businesses and all this kind of stuff.",
        "And I just rolled my eyes a little bit and said, Brian(ph), look, I could argue with you about this, but do you honestly think we could pull it off?",
        "Do you really think there's a grand conspiracy of college professors and environmentalists?",
        "(LAUGHTER)"

        "You wouldn't be competent enough to do it.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "And so, sometimes, if you change the conversation around and then you suddenly reach out to people, you can find middle ground.",
        "Yet, you often find a highly contentious arguments over things like the XL pipeline, for example, the proposal to bring the bitumen down from Alberta in Canada through a pipeline down through refineries on the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "And there are those people on the conservative side who say, this is American jobs.",

        "Yeah, that's a very interesting point, Neal, because I would argue that that is kind of a red herring on both sides.",
        "You know, lot of the environmentalists who are quoting scientists and others, saying it will be game over for climate change.",
        "And when I look at the number, it says, I don't see that.",
        "Burning this tar sands oil, yes, it is worse for climate, but about 15 percent worse than traditional petroleum when you burn it in a car.",
        "It's not good, but it's not dramatically worse.",
        "What's a lot worse are things like burning coal for electricity or just the fuel efficiency of the American automobile fleet, which we've made a lot of progress in recently.",
        "So I'm not saying we should go after XL, but I think, you know - and go build that thing - but I think that became a kind of a Waterloo, a symbolic kind of political issue rather than a substantial scientific one.",
        "The environmental community and the business community kind of decided to go to war over that issue.",
        "And I think they are both were wrong, frankly, that there, you know, it wasn't the Waterloo moment for the environment.",
        "It isn't the single thing that will make or break climate change.",
        "It's one of many things.",
        "And in terms of the other side, about the number of jobs it'll create and how much economic opportunity this would afford for America, well, there are some real questions there.",
        "So I think, again, there's a tendency to pick these symbolic issues and make a dramatic political statement over them when, often, the science and the real numbers don't support it.",
        "And we've just created a lot of friction when it wouldn't actually really solve the big problem.",
        "Let's see if we get some callers in on the conversation.",

        "Once people recognize you for anything, you're in a bind.",
