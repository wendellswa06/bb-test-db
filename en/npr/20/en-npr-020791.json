        "The Brits may have sold off Rolls Royce to the Germans and Manchester United may now play soccer under American owners, but hey, hands off British chocolate.",
        "It's an article of faith here that, never mind the Swiss or the Belgians, British chocolate is the best in world and British children have been waking up on Christmas morning since the Norman invasion with a big bar of Cadbury's milk chocolate in their stocking - well, since 1824, anyway, when Quaker John Cadbury founded the firm selling hot chocolate as an alternative to alcohol.",
        "Cadbury built a model village called Bournville that set the standard for workers housing of the day and where the main factory was known as the factory in the garden.",
        "So it's perhaps not too surprising that John Cadbury's great-great-granddaughter Felicity Loudon expressed shock that such an iconic British firm might, as she put it, disappear into an American plastic cheese company.",
        "I don't know that they would understand the history of Bournville Village, therefore, the great of the philanthropy that went with it.",
        "I don't think they'd understand that it was a garden factory that was created and that every single house had a garden with a vegetable patch with an orchard and that my great-great-grandfather thought that nobody should live or work where a rose cannot grow.",
        "The confirmation yesterday that U.S.",
        "chocolate maker Hershey was looking at the possibility of making a bid for Cadbury has added a little spice to the chocolate.",
        "Not to be outdone is the torch bearer of paternalistic, mustachioed chocolate makers, founder Milton Hershey was also well-known for caring for his workers and for establishing a long tradition of philanthropy.",
        "Analyst David Buik of BGC Partners in London says the likely need for layoffs -or redundancies, as they're known here - might make a Hershey-Cadbury combination less likely.",
        "Well, I think more that they were trying to be - or had the time to be more conservative as far as putting their families at risk.",

        "It was too - I was trying - anyway, basically - sorry about that.",
        "Basically, what I would like to see, I think, will lead to more understanding -because I do believe in climate change and practice when I can and preach when I can - is that we need to get the press involve in an intelligent way and get kind of a quality list of scientists they can talk to when things happened so they can, you know, explain it properly to the general population.",
        "And then, I think, it'll get to the congressmen and the leaders, and we can go forward with this - the energy things that you guest is doing."

        "Well, you know, eventually, it was proven that it wasn't.",
        "But this is what, you know, this sensationalism is - and I can give hundreds of examples - is what I'm concerned about in trying to educate people.",
        "I would say, in normal - other folks outside of the university that are not scientists that are willing to talk to all the time, they're very interested in my opinion because I strike a middle road and try to, you know, have them understand the seriousness of the problem, at the same time, not to use the scare tactics that can happen with the climate aficionado people.",

        "There are a lot of people saying this is the road to America's energy independence.",
        "And again, there are environmentalists who say this is very dangerous.",
        "Well, that's a - that actually could be a pretty serious issue, but, again, that's one where we're going to have to - like Jim said, too, we may have to wait a little while to sort out some of the science on this.",
        "You know, it's pretty clear that fracking - or natural gas, anyway - is beneficial to American energy independence and to reducing the effects of climate change from coal.",
        "But, yeah, we're beginning to see that some of the fracking in certain locations could be, you know, pretty detrimental to water supplies, water quality and so on, as well the fact if the natural gas is leaking out of the ground, it's also methane going into the atmosphere, which is another potent greenhouse gas.",
        "So whether the - there are real climate benefits to fracking will depend a lot in how leaky the systems are.",
        "So like a lot of issues, this has become very polarized.",
        "Very pro-fracking folks have taken a kind of one-sided view of this, saying it's good for America, it's good for jobs, it's good for the environment.",
        "And there's a very strong anti-fracking community that has sort of taking a very single-minded view on it as well, saying it's all bad for water, bad for the environment.",
        "And I suspect when the science gets sorted out, like usual, it's going to be kind of in the gray area in between.",
        "And the answer nobody likes is going to be, it depends.",
        "There might be places where fracking techniques are very beneficial and work well.",
        "And there'll be some places where you really shouldn't do it.",
        "And we're going to have to figure that out in a hurry.",
        "And like Jim before, you know, again, sometimes we have to wait for the science to iterate back and forth between these other political extremes of one position or the other.",
        "And nine times out of 10, we find out, you know, often, there's truth in both sides of the issue, and there's a middle ground to be found."

        "So I think we just need to not back away from the science.",
        "We're not going conceding evidence at all, but rather to package it a bit differently, to frame it a bit differently and to point out the other benefits of taking action on climate change.",

        "Germany, farther north than we are, has much more solar than about anywhere in the United States.",

        "could do well in solar.",

        "And, of course, we have bioenergy here, too, and the debates about things like corn ethanol.",
        "That's another big contentious issue here in the Midwest.",
