        "And he was not happy, did not find he was being listened to.",
        "And certainly by the middle of 2004 he was pretty convinced that he was going to leave regardless of whether the president was reelected or not.",

        "And he started to think that maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea just to stay on perhaps for a few months, perhaps for a year, just for continuity's sake.",
        "What happened, however, was that a week after the election, after the president went up to Camp David to think about his coming new term, he came back and Powell received in his office a call from Andy Card, the president's chief of staff, saying that the president had decided to make a change at the State Department, and saying that they wanted Powell's resignation letter in two days."

        "And so he really wasn't able to negotiate.",
        "Even if he had left on a trip like that with instructions to negotiate, the policy kept changing here.",

        "How do you think he felt, or do you know how he felt about those allegations?",
        "I think he regrets it very much.",
        "I think he's a person who's very conscious of his own reputation, keeps very close watch on it and would not have knowingly gone forward with information that he thought was false.",

        "He is not a person who's greatly introspective.",
