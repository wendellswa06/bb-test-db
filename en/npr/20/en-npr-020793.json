        "Well, the challengers pretty clearly have three votes, and they need both Kennedy and the chief justice to win, whereas those defending the law clearly have four votes, and they need just one more to prevail.",
        "But nobody's sure where those critical two votes lie.",
        "At the end of the week, do you have a kind of favorite moment in the arguments?",
        "I think it was when two of the court's conservative justices - Alito and Scalia - pooh-poohed the notion that if the challengers win, millions of people would immediately lose their health insurance and the individual insurance market would begin to crater.",
        "Justice Scalia pointed out that in the past when the court has issued problematic decisions, Congress has fixed the problem."
