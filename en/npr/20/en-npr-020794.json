        "And when you describe it as one of the most beautiful but also most terrible places you've ever seen, what do you mean by that?",
        "When you go there, the beauty of the African jungle is immediately apparent.",
        "And when you look up, you see the cascading vines, you see the birds flying around, and you think to yourself, this is just a very profound place.",
