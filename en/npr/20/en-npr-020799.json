        "We'll see if we could get that straightened out.",
        "Though Kerry, it's probably fair to say that those other types of Hollywood escapist movies that came out this summer, the superhero blow-'em-ups, the critics didn't like those either and they made money too, and they're made for boys.",
        "They are made for boys, but I think that because they - their ratings are so very high, or their numbers are so very high, their dollar amounts are so very high, it's like the men shoot-'em-up, boys like them.",
        "Girls go to them.",
        "I mean, I know a lot of my girlfriends like the shoot-'em-ups, too.",
        "I'm not into violence, so I don't really go to them.",
        "But it's just kind of like OK, it's OK for these to be male-female, very popular, you know, they get dissed for different reasons.",
        "I think that the special effects weren't good enough, or the story line was just kind of lame.",
        "But the special effects were still the key.",
        "They weren't good enough.",
        "And the rom-coms, it's the, you know, the - it was just so, you know, the repartee between the two wasn't - I don't - it just seems like kind of a real minimization of this female approach to life in general, because rom-coms are just kind of chick flicks.",
        "Right.",
        "Kerry...",
        "I guess I don't learn anything except that in a way, it's kind of sexism in the movies.",

        "It's all about getting people partnered up into long-term, heterosexual, monogamous relationships as quickly as possible - even if, like I said earlier, they are deeply incompatible.",
        "I'm thinking particularly of movies starring Gerard Butler, where he usually plays this boorish, macho, misogynistic pig, and women in the movie - women who he's paired with spend the movie hating him, and yet inevitably by the end of 90 minutes, you know, can't live without him.",
        "I think that's an unsustainable model for romance as well.",

        "But that storyline I found particularly disturbing because the point - I mean, the point of that love story is basically that he's finally found a woman who was too good to objectify, and too good to manipulate.",
        "But all the other women who came before her are totally worthy of being manipulated and objectified.",
        "And suddenly this, you know, this one woman, Emma Stone, comes along who has qualities that sort of exempt her from that kind of sexist treatment and melts - and manages to melt his, you know, misogynistic heart of stone.",

        "And it really, ironically, a lot of paralleling the relationship.",
        "And now - and it's interesting that we went from a movie like that where, you know, I don't think there was any pretense as to how the relationship played out.",
        "And now, I think that with my generation in particular, there's an almost fear of commitment that leads us to believe that this whole friends-with-benefits thing can work out when really, it's kind of silly because either you're going to wind up together or you're not.",
        "It's the same thing.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "The difference between - I think \"\"When Harry Met Sally,\"\" Chloe Angyal, was an important rom-com because it introduced the quality of - the quality of the writing and the repartee was, I think, a step ahead.",
        "I think it was a step ahead and, well, it was a step forward in quality, but it's actually a step back to the level of banter that you have in something like \"\"His Girl Friday.\"\" An interesting thing about the role of banter in early movies like that is that it was a replacement for sex.",
        "You know, because of the Hays Code, they couldn't show physical friction and physical tension, so they, you know, they replaced it with really, really good wordplay.",
        "And you're absolutely right.",
        "When Harry Met Sally\"\" brings that back, and the banter is really good and, you know, the quality of the dialogue is quite good, and that is something that has almost completely disappeared from romantic comedies in the last - the romantic comedies that I grew up with, you know, in the past 10 to 15 years, is that the banter is totally gone.",
        "And that's something that \"\"Friends with Benefits\"\" brings back.",

        "Clarkson's performance as Mila Kunis's ex-hippie-groupie-party-animal mother left me fairly certain, and her turn as Jim Sturgess' loving but brutally honest mom in \"\"One Day\"\" confirms it: Patricia Clarkson is cooler than any other movie mother in recent memory, and she's sure as hell cooler than your real-life mom.",
        "Hey, whatever happened to Teri Garr?",
        "No, you're absolutely right.",

        "And not only that, but the worse the fraud, the more shorting there was.",
        "And the fraud tended to be exposed earlier when short sellers were involved.",
        "There's evidence showing that short sellers actually act like detectives, and they're making money, but in the meantime, they actually provide important benefits to the financial markets.",
