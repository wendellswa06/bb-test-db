        "The Irish government, on the other hand, they were doing okay until they tried to bail out their banks, and that wound up being a lot more expensive than everyone thought.",
        "But despite these differences, you do see a sort of herd mentality among investors, where fear spreads from one country to another in Europe.",
        "At the same time now, investors around the world still see buying U.S.",

        "So when people get worried about the global economy and whether this is the debt crisis now in Europe or even the big 2008 financial crisis, which of course was centered in the U.S., when worries like that arise, people still rush to lend money to the U.S.",

        "Is Europe worse off than we are or vice versa or what?",
        "Well, when you step back from these sort of immediate issues and look at the bigger picture, you do start to see a lot more similarities between the U.S.",
        "and Europe.",
        "One big example is that America's national debt is about the same size relative to our overall economy as Spain's debt is relative to its overall economy and about the same size as Portugal's debt is relative to its overall economy.",

        "Basically, there will be a lot more elderly people who qualify for government retirement benefits and government health care benefits, and there will be relatively fewer working people to support them.",
        "So in Europe, we saw this recently starting to play out when we saw street protests in France, when the government raised the retirement age.",
        "And in the U.S., we're seeing it this week in the case of Medicare and Social Security, you know, both of which are big issues that President Obama's debt commission is trying to work out.",
