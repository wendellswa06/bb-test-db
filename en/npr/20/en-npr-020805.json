        "I have one of those little houses that's a tear-down on the island.",
        "I had been offered, two years, three years ago, $1.7 million for it, and today I think I might be able to get maybe 950,000 for it.",
        "Are you still able to be philosophical and think this is a bad downturn but there'll be an upturn at some point?",
        "Oh, there will be an upturn at some point, as soon as we get capitulation.",
        "Everybody admits, okay, these properties are not selling.",
        "They're not worth what I think they are.",
        "Let's lower the price.",
        "Meaning that there are some sellers who are still hanging on and trying for that higher dollar, and that's clogging up the market?",
        "Right, and that's why the number of homes for sale is astronomical compared to what they used to be.",
        "I'm remembering from our last conversation that you had had dealings with a woman who had an opportunity to sell some property at a ridiculous profit.",
        "She said no and then had come back to you after the market tanked, needing then to sell.",
        "How did that turn out?",
        "Many aid groups continue to provide essentials: food, water, shelter, medical care.",
        "Others, though, focus on the long haul and work to rebuild systems to support local farmers or develop schools to help meet the demand for medical and mental health professionals.",

        "Email us your story, that's talk@npr.org.",
        "But first, rebuilding Haiti, and we begin with Joia Mukherjee, chief medical officer for the group Partners in Health, also a professor with Harvard Medical School.",
        "She joins us now from member station WBUR in Boston.",
        "And Dr. Mukherjee, thanks very much for being on TALK OF THE NATION today.",
        "You're welcome, Neal.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "And I know you've been coordinating Partner in Health's response to the cholera outbreak.",
        "Any signs that the illness is spreading into Port-au-Prince?",
        "No, we've been quite fortunate so far.",
        "I think there have been a few cases in Port-au-Prince, but we haven't seen spread within Port-au-Prince as of yet.",
        "The coordination, I just want to make it clear, that is going on, on the ground by our Haitian team.",
        "I'm sort of helping to support what they need, but they have just done amazing work in reaching out to communities to prevent the spread even within our own catchment area of Saint-Marc and prevent the spread elsewhere in Haiti.",
        "And I'm told that cholera, though once you've got is quite terrible and easily spread, on the other hand is fairly also easily treated and prevented.",
        "Yeah, very easy to treat.",
        "All you do is rehydrate someone.",
        "You sometimes may use antibiotics, but it's not the mainstay of treatment.",
        "The mainstay is just making sure people don't die of dehydration.",
        "The difficulty is it is a rapidly dehydrating, diarrheal disease, so much quicker than the other forms of diarrhea we commonly see in Haiti and elsewhere.",
        "Prevention is soap, water, purifying, you know, water with chlorine tablets.",
        "I mean, it's fairly straightforward.",
        "But getting to all of the areas where people live is the big challenges, delivering those messages and the tools for prevention."

        "Now, Partners in Health has been in Haiti providing services for two decades, including responses to crises like this cholera outbreak.",
        "But I wonder, has the earthquake provided an opportunity to help rebuild a more robust health system for the future?",
        "Not yet, Neal, and I hope that it will.",
        "I mean, we are, ourselves, working closely with the Ministry of Health to build a very large, state-of-the-art teaching hospital in central Haiti.",
        "But the medical school, the university hospital, the nursing school - all of those remain nearly incapacitated, if not totally incapacitated.",
        "The facilities throughout Haiti are really under-funded, understaffed.",
        "We're very fortunate that we have been working for so long that the 10 facilities where we work in Haiti, we have staff, we have supplies.",
        "I'm very proud to report that we've not had a single stock-out since the beginning of this epidemic, and yet it's our warehouse, jointly operated between Partners in Health and the ministry, that's supplying all of the affected areas in Haiti.",
        "So I think, you know, we know how to rebuilt systems, but that money has not been flowing reliably into Haiti as of yet.",
        "It has been pledged, but we have not seen a lot of movement for it on rebuilding or building the health infrastructure of Haiti.",
        "Where were those pledges from, other countries, including the United States?",
        "Yes, and I think it's it behooves all of us who care about global poverty, and Haiti in particular, to really track that money and say who's pledged what.",
        "And, you know, some of it is now posted on the website of the Office of the Special Envoy of the U.N., who's pledged what.",
        "But it's a very small amount of money that's actually gone to Haiti and even a smaller amount that's gone to the government of Haiti, who is actually charged with providing the majority of public services, obviously.",
        "And if the, well, inadequate facilities that were there have now been destroyed and are not up and running, clearly this is going to be a continuing problem for years ahead, until they are up and running.",
        "Absolutely, absolutely.",
        "And we believe that there are really two discrete but interconnected aspects to this that need to be simultaneously done.",
        "One is to develop a robust public system because that's the only system that will get as far as Haitians are living, where they are, you know, villages, towns."

        "And the second is really to mobilize the community to be agents of health.",
        "And we believe that paying people to do that work is also a way of giving employment and improving the economy.",
        "And the service sector can be a robust engine for economic development, as well.",
        "And so another thing that's really been remarkable to me during this cholera outbreak, and again, this is I just got off the phone with our director of the program in the Artibonite at Saint-Marc, in Saint-Marc, Dr. Patrick Almazor, and he has told me that none of our HIV-infected patients have gotten cholera.",
        "And that is because they're getting excellent community-based care.",
        "They have people that are working with them at the home level.",
        "They're giving them messages of general health and hygiene, helping them with water and food security.",
        "Similarly, the kids that we're taking care of in our malnutrition program, none of those kids have gotten cholera.",
        "So these are groups that in general we would consider quite vulnerable to contracting cholera and dying from cholera, and yet in these two very vulnerable groups, we have had adequate prevention even without the additional effort we've put in, just because our community-based system works.",
        "My brother's been to Haiti twice, recently.",

        "There's still a lot of rubble that hasn't been cleared.",
        "There are still huge numbers, hundreds of thousands of displaced people living in absolute squalor.",
        "And I think again, you know, hopefully if there is one small, positive thing that can come from this epidemic I hate to even, you know, sort of conflate positivity with such a terrible thing, but it will be refocusing people's attention on the living conditions in Haiti and to say yes, there was an outpouring of support and sympathy, but where is that money, and let's figure out a real tracking system with real accountability both for governments that pledge the money but for NGOs that have received the money, as well.",
        "I don't see massive changes since January 12.",
        "Dominic, thanks very much for the call."

        "Does money vanish?",
        "Sure, they are reliable partners, and sure, money vanished.",
        "I think if if the crisis on Wall Street taught us anything, it should be that where there is money, there is corruption and that third-world governments don't have a lock on corruption, nor do governments have a lock on corruption, that the reason we are able to prevent corruption in most wealthier countries more easily than poor countries is because we put money into systems.",
        "And once systems and regulation starts to fall apart, then corruption will occur, or corruption will become rampant.",
        "And so the government of Haiti is a very at least in the Ministry of Health very reliable partners we have.",
