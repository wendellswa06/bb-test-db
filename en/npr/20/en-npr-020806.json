        "Good.",
        "It's nice to be here, Neal.",
        "You were last with us in March and anticipated a growing need for mental health support for quake survivors.",
        "Have you seen the need, and have you seen the need met?",
        "Well, the need has not yet been met.",
        "The need has become clear to everybody.",
        "We at the Center for Mind-Body Medicine are working with every major health and mental health organization in Haiti, including the Ministry of Health and Partners in Health and the Catholic Church and the medical school and the nursing school and the general hospital.",
        "And everyone says, although there are the short-term needs, the direct, medical needs - of course, cholera being the most striking example right now - but the long-term need that everyone agrees is likely to be paramount is the psychological need.",
        "And there really, there weren't before the earthquake, and there certainly aren't after the earthquake, the kind of organized services or organized response that's needed.",
        "And so we are in Haiti to train people to provide the kind of primary mental health care that's needed for the whole population.",
        "And do you have a facility to do that?",
        "Well, we have funds to begin, and we have funds from one of my board members.",
        "Donald de Laski has funded the first effort, which will train 120 leaders from those major organizations."

        "And we're working and everybody has been so responsive.",
        "That's quite because they all recognize the need, the long-term goal of training 1,500 people and creating a network of healing throughout Haiti, we need considerably more support to do.",

        "Just before the break, you were talking about training - setting up a facility, and there's money for it, to train a cohort of new mental health professionals.",
        "It's significant, it's a start, but it also seems like a drop in the bucket.",
        "Well, it's you know, one of the things that's so striking is that everybody is so on edge in Haiti.",
        "I think we saw little glimpses of it with the response to trying to establish clinics for cholera, that the anger and the is just under the surface, not on the sense - terrible sense of loss.",
        "When I was down there a month or two ago and did some workshops, one of the things that virtually everyone in the workshop said is: I'm so irritable.",
        "I get angry so much more easily than before.",
        "So everyone recognizes that the anger, the sadness and there's been no opportunity for most people to express what's going on inside.",
        "So we create groups for the helpers, both the professional helpers and also the leaders in the community, priests and nuns and voodoo healers, leaders of women's groups, as well as doctors and nurses.",
        "And they express what's inside, often for the first time, and then they learn very simple we teach them very simple techniques: to relax, to quiet themselves down, to access their imagination and their intuition so they can solve or at least take a more positive look at these incredibly difficult problems that everyone is facing."
