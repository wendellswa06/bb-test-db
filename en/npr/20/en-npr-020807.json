        "I was very selfish.",

        "And I came back, and I learned that they can be part of the solution.",
        "Obviously, trees in Haiti, as you said, most of them have been cut down for fuel.",
        "They also, the lack of the deforestation contributes to the erosion problem because the trees are not there to soak up the water and hold the soil in place.",
        "So obviously, 20 cook stoves, anything helps, but there's lots more to do.",
        "We need so much more to do.",
        "I'm about to go on Monday.",
        "I'm going six more days, because I already we identified already an orphanage.",

        "There's no other country in the world that has more nonprofits, more NGOs, but somehow we have these huge issues.",

        "And I got to tell you, you know, I saw progress.",
        "I saw things getting done, but the most overwhelming thing that you see in Port-au-Prince and in Petionville is just the enormous amount of NGOs and their staff running around.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Very conflicted.",
        "What the last caller mentioned, it's what's happening, but you know, it's - as he said, it's part of the economy of rebuilding.",
        "Unfortunately, this is part of our world - is people that have everything, and these people that have nothing.",
