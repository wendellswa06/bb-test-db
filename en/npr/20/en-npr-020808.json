        "In the short term, he's planning to rely on commercial rockets to ferry cargo and astronauts into orbit.",

        "And that was not remotely consistent with anything that I had ever heard about the internal FBI management or feelings of the rank-and-file toward the management.",
        "And so one really good way to get a read on what the internal reaction was would be to just FOIA all of these statements to staff from all of the field offices, from all of the divisions, from all of the sections and see, what were people telling their staffs?"

        "Comey was forced out of the FBI last May, a while ago.",
