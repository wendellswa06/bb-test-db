        "And now, a summer action film without special effects would be a bit like a call in talk show without any calls.",
        "This weekend, the next movie in \"\"The Mummy\"\" series opens, and some scenes look like an expensive video game.",
        "And that is the problem argues Peter Hartlaub, reviewer for The San Francisco Chronicle.",
        "In a column earlier this summer, he complained that while computers might one day replace the entire department of motor vehicles, they will never be able to take the place of a guy and a gladiator helmet flying off the back of a moving chariot.",
        "What do you think, does Hollywood still needs stuntmen and women?",
        "Or can computer-generated effects make the movie?",
        "If you are a stuntman or woman, we would love to hear from you, our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255.",
        "The email address is talk@npr.org and you can comment on our blog, it's at npr.org/blogofthenation.",
        "Peter Hartlaub is the pop culture critic and a film reviewer for the San Francisco Chronicle.",
        "And he recently wrote the piece, \"\"Why Action Films Need Stuntmen and Women.\"\" He joins us now by phone from his office in San Francisco.",
        "Good to have you with us, Peter.",
        "Thank you for having me, Lynn.",
        "So, Peter if the technologies there will pull off all these elaborate digital scenes, why do we need stuntmen and women?",
        "I think precisely because the technology isn't there.",
        "I think that special effects are a great thing, I mean I grew up with the \"\"Star Wars\"\" films and \"\"Terminator\"\" films and just being so excited with whatever was going to come next.",
        "But I think the studios have treated it almost like an arms race for the last maybe five, six, seven years.",
        "And each one wants more special effects shots than the next and you end up with, you know, the end of a film with two computer animated monsters fighting over a green screen background and you know, we're not ready for that.",
        "I mean, it doesn't look real it doesn't look real like a stunt or someone really doing something and then maybe having touched up a little bit with special effects.",
        "When did the studios, you know, sort of start to treat special effects, like you say, like an arms race?",
        "Honestly, I think when a movie is successful with special effects, one recent one that I think did a great job was \"\"Spider-Man 2\"\".",
        "I thought most of \"\"Transformers\"\" was really good.",
        "I think when a studio sees it done well, they say, I want that and I want more.",
        "And I think they put a lot of pressure on a special effects house that you know, to do things that just can't be done right now, you know, and again I compare it to an arms race.",
        "But things that escalated to the point where you know, I actually really appreciate it when someone takes a step back in a movie like \"\"The Dark Knight\"\" and just focuses so much on stunts and build real sets and just uses the CGI as little as possible.",
        "What other films can you think of that do exactly what you just described?",
        "That is that give you more of a sense of reality around stunts then.",
        "I think that \"\"Indiana Jones,\"\" the last one, while there was a lot of CGI in that, as much as possible, they tried to ground it in some kind of reality.",
        "There is a lot of really good stunt work on that.",
        "I thought that was a great one.",
        "I think one little scene movie that I really liked, the movie itself had all kinds of plot holes but I loved the stunts was \"\"The Descent\"\".",
        "And it was in theaters for about 12 minutes, but I loved it.",
        "And I think it's going to hold up 30 years from now way better than say a \"\"Fantastic Four\"\" movie.",
        "I will for sure, Neal."

        "It's been terrible there earlier in the week.",
        "Nevertheless, I wanted to ask you -the Batmobile, I think the first question that a lot of people had: Did you make this from the ground up, or did you adapt something?",
        "Well, actually, I started out with a Futura, which was a concept Lincoln that I acquired from Ford Motor Company.",
        "But I really think that the concept - come from Doescher, when Doescher called me to come over there to make a crime fighter in 1966, a 20th century crime fighter.",
        "I said, well, let me see your script.",
        "Let me see your dialogue.",
        "Let me get an idea what your show is - which is kind of different because the Batman that Bob Kane figured out for DC Comics was a comic book.",
        "But with Doescher, this is real.",
        "So when I went and looked at everything -if youll remember that pow, bang, wow is going out - throughout his whole script.",
        "That gives you an idea of what I had to contend with.",
        "I said, well, if you're going to make these exciting sounds and all this thing that comes up, I'm going to do the same thing to the car.",

        "Yeah, well, that was what I mainly decided because then I finally made a car, a hunk of steel, become an actor.",
        "He became a star.",
        "And that's why the car became so popular - because everybody would wait to see what's going to happen next to the car, whenever Doescher would make some kind of a funny sound.",
        "And of course, Adam West and Burt Ward -they all joined in to the group, made it even more - funnier, and made it become more of a comedy and more enjoyable than it is to be a serious type of crime fighter."
