        "So while she was out in L.A., you know, I brought her to the studio and I came in for a playback, and Spike goes we're going to film your mom going in a house.",
        "And I went, oh, okay.",
        "But then, I looked at my mom and I said are you sure?",
        "And she said, yeah, and I didn't press it right then.",
        "I waited until we got back home and I said that do you realize the type of invasion that's about to occur if you do that?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And her response was, yeah, but a lot of people need to see what we're going through.",
        "So, you know, a lot of people have been coming up to me and saying that, man, when your mom came on the screen, I really cried.",
        "It really broke me up.",
        "And the thing that I told them - I said, well, if you felt that way for my mom, you have to really multiply that by at least 100,000 people because my mom is just one of a large number of people who had the exact same experience.",
        "Terence Blanchard and his mom were featured in \"\"When the Levees Broke,\"\" the Spike Lee documentary.",

        "And I remember when he said that to me, it just kind of shoot me back into reality.",
        "So we all worked 150 percent on that project, but we tried to not become so consumed with what we were working on, you know, because we knew by doing that, we'd, you know, we'd totally be intimidated by the entire project.",

        "Right.",
        "A lot of people come up to me after the show, saying, man, how do you play a trumpet with no mouthpiece?",
        "But I always explain to them that it's all built-in.",
        "It's all in one piece.",
        "It's the design of a guy named David Monnett.",
        "And when I talked to him, his whole ideas - he said he tries to build these horns like they're race cars.",
        "He tries to make them very rigid, so that the sound doesn't dissipate in the vibrating metal.",
        "The sound passes through.",
        "And as a result, these horns really project.",
        "There's also a device, a foot pedal with - that's 10-foot pedals in front of you, which sounds like, it looks like an electronic processor next to it."
