        "There were a ton but they were just so seamless and it played in to help tell the story, as opposed to distract from it, and I think it was just a perfect movie in terms of special effects.",

        "And it, you know, I actually got to work on \"\"Batman,\"\" the last one, \"\"The Dark Knight\"\" here in Chicago, and I actually worked as a stunt PA, which is, you know, the bottom rung - the bottom feeder of the production cycle.",
        "But nonetheless, it was truly, absolutely amazing to see that, and I have obviously seen the film, and it is truly organic.",
        "But when you're doing an independent film, it's easier to do, you know, a bullet or a flash or, you know, a blood splatter in a computer, as opposed to doing it, you know, with a script and everything else because it takes hours of preparation and money and the stunts that you don't have, so, I mean...",
        "That's interesting because I've always thought the special effects were really expensive for some reason or added to...",
        "They are and they aren't.",

        "But, you know, as long as 260 million dollar budgets are around, then, yes, \"\"Batman\"\" will be made and it's going to be amazing.",

        "It's probably not the kind of independent film that you're talking about, but it was definitely a lot cheaper than the ones in the summer.",
        "And the special effects, I thought, were fantastic because they served the story.",
        "I mean, they didn't look entirely realistic, but there was no more than it needed to serve the story.",
        "And the writing in the story was good, and it had a real emotional impact.",
        "That doesn't bother me.",
        "What bothers me is when they use these computer effects to essentially replace, you know, plot and logic and everything else.",
        "Yeah, to replicate reality which is - I agree.",
        "It's totally not fair and I think the films that are successful are the ones that remove reality from it and try to go for an aesthetic and try to push the aesthetic of the CG or whatever it is, and those usually do really work out well."
