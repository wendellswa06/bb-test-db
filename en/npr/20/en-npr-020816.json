        "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.",
        "Right, where they flew through the air...",

        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, it's not like they are - I guess some of them do know the martial arts but then they expand upon that with special effects.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, a lot of those films I like because - I like them generally for the art direction more than for the special effects.",
        "But I think you still get that human performance, even though it's wire work, you know, being done so that they're leaping through the air and doing these incredible superhuman things.",
        "It is a real person who's doing that wire work and that would be an example of what I think is, you know, fairly seamless when it's done well, blend of the CGI and some real life impressive performances that I love."

        "And for the most part, I mean, there have been a couple of misses.",
        "A lot of those films that have used that kind of special effects blended with the martial arts that have made their way to the United States are the ones that are done really well.",

        "And CGI can't really replace real models.",
        "CGI absolutely ruined the latest \"\"Star Wars\"\" film, for instance.",
        "And even where CGI worked at the time, like in \"\"Lord of the Rings,\"\" it looks pretty hokey now, like an outdated video game.",
        "And I think that's also a point that you made, Peter, that the special effects get outdated pretty quickly.",
        "They do.",
        "I would disagree slightly with the \"\"Star Wars\"\" movies.",
        "I think - I'm one of those, you know - maybe there aren't so many of us, but I'm one of the defenders of the newer films, especially the last one.",
        "I thought they had sort of a unified look, you know.",
        "Yes, it was excessive at many times, but - so I do kind of defend those films a little more and I am a little biased, too.",

        "Oh, yeah.",
        "It was a director who was so talented as an action director that, you know, the tension that was built and the way that he shot things was done in such a way that when the special effects came, you didn't even know it, you know.",
        "And there wasn't that much.",
        "That's a film I just - if people like, especially if you like the science fiction fantasy type stuff with a little bit of intelligence, I mean that was another just really great action film that I don't think enough people went out and saw.",

        "It's a classic laugh line and it's great.",
        "But that's not originally how it's scripted.",
        "But Indiana or Harrison Ford has been injured earlier and so they are unable to shoot it the way they want it.",
        "But if you don't have the real actor there, you can't get those happy accidents that they'll become kind of classic scenes.",

        "It's a good point.",
        "One of my favorites of the special effects films recently was \"\"Cloverfield.\"\" It was - the effects were done by Phil Tippit(ph) from Berkeley.",
        "It's his studio and he's the one who did a lot of the early \"\"Star Wars\"\" stop motion stuff.",
        "And what I liked about it was, OK, you know, you had to take Dramamine to watch it.",
        "The cameras are moving all around like \"\"Blair Witch Project\"\" and some people aren't going to be able to get past that.",
        "But so much of it was done with handheld cameras and the dialogue and a lot of the events that went on just felt completely improvised.",
        "And, you know, that's an important thing, I mean, that your caller just brought up.",
        "I think if you start scripting out every little, you know, every little special effect that's going to happen throughout a movie, you know, I kind of wonder what that does to the improvised performance.",

        "For example, in \"\"Spartacus,\"\" when you're seeing the scene where Rome sends this whole legion of soldiers across the hill and you're seeing this big wide shot of these thousands of guys marching in formation, and just how when you're looking at it, you're like, wow, that's really thousands of guys, whereas, you know, like \"\"Lord of the Rings,\"\" you got big armies that are flashy but you know that for the most part, it's being done with computer and it just doesn't really have the same sort of effect.",

        "You know, but that's always the question for me.",
        "If you know, if you can discuss it and wonder afterwards, it's like plastic surgery, you know, good plastic surgery.",
