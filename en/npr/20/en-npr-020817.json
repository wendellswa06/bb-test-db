        "And maybe we should explain, at least at that point in their planning, the participation of other Allied forces would've been limited, including Great Britain, France, Canada, for that matter the Soviet Union, because they had been fighting the war longer than the United States and they had just won, and had to get back to life.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "What they were essentially looking at for the invasion of Japan was what would functionally be a duplication of the casualty surge in Europe that was principally, you know, driven by combat in Europe, that that would be repeated in the Pacific.",
        "And that was not a pleasant prospect.",
        "Let me get to another aspect, if I could.",
        "In history it is often said that war planners had projected that a land invasion of Japan would've cost the lives of a million U.S.",
        "soldiers and many more Japanese.",
        "Where does that figure come from and does it seem right to you?",
        "Well, you have to remember that these figures are basically put together by planning staffs' best guess from, you know, say, the terrain, the number of units that are going to be fielded; the number of enemy units that they're going to have to fight.",
        "And as early as middle part of 1944, when we started getting a pretty firm grasp of just how casualties were playing out, and they ultimately came to the conclusion that the casualties on the low end would be somewhere in the neighborhood, perhaps of, say, about a quarter-million and on the upper end, in through the million range.",
        "And based on your experience, Ms. Mahle, how much does a change in leadership mean to the people working for the agency?",
        "It's amazing because when you think about innovative investors, you're thinking about people investing in Silicon Valley in high-tech.",
        "But this could be considered the original green investment.",
        "They are more energy efficient than truck and they do a good bit less pollution than truck.",
        "As congestion increases over the highways, they have a great advantage of having their own infrastructure.",
        "But I might also mention, when you say Silicon Valley, 20 years from now, Burlington Northern will still be with us and still be one of the top railroads in the United States.",
        "We cannot say the same about Microsoft or Google or any of the other companies.",
        "Those are very dynamic and subject to tremendous competitive pressures.",
        "The railroad industry is very insulated from entry, very insulated from competitive pressures.",
        "Well, if this is such a great investment, what's the downside?",
        "The main downside is that the most important commodity that railroads carry is coal."

        "This is not an industry that's going to make a 20 percent, 30 percent return on investment.",
        "I mean, you kind of know what you're getting.",
        "But a lot of investors are looking for that quick hit, high rate of return on their investment - get in, get out.",
        "And if you're looking for that as your objective, then the railroads are not for you.",
        "I think Mr. Buffett does invest for the long term.",

        "And of course, he has a little more cash on hand.",
