        "There's a lot of stuff, man, to talk about this week.",
        "There is, and one of the things we could talk about is Mary Fallin's victory in yesterday's Republican primary in Oklahoma, and the only reason I think that's interesting is because the winner of the Democratic primary, Lieutenant Governor Jari Askins is also a woman.",
        "So for one of the rare times in history you have two women running against each other for governor.",
        "Hopefully one day we won't have to point out that two women are running because it's always two men who are running, but historic - Oklahoma will elect its first female governor in November.",
        "Didn't one of them succeed one of the other in office?",
        "Yeah, well, actually, before Mary Fallin was elected to Congress in 2006, she had been lieutenant governor herself, and then when the Democrats took over the governorship in 2000 and - after Mary Fallin left the lieutenant governorship, the Democrats won that.",
        "So Askins succeeded her, succeeded Fallin as lieutenant governor.",

        "Well, I didn't really, only because I think it is so different on radio as opposed to on TV.",
        "And the great thing - one of the most disappointing things is I do think, you know, not being immodest, but I do think my call was good, and a reason that it was, I think, is because it was like the easiest homerun to call.",
        "It was absolutely going to be gone as soon as he hit it.",
        "He just obliterated it.",
        "And so that lets a broadcaster kind of air it all out.",

        "It was 450 feet.",
        "It was majestic to watch and the fans were going nuts.",
        "So I mean, I've thought about the moment and thought about the possibility of doing the moment, but I try desperately not to pre-script anything that I'm going to say, just because I think homeruns and great moments like that can be so different one to the next.",

        "One of the odd things, you're 28 years old, as I understand, the youngest play-by-play guy in the major leagues, and you know as well as I do, you might go the rest of your career and not have a homerun that big.",
        "Yeah, you know, I thought about going up to Barry and asking him if we could just go out on the field and recreate it.",
        "But I figured he probably wasn't going to be all that into that idea.",
        "So you're right.",
        "I mean, nobody may have - there are very few broadcasters who've ever had a moment quite like yesterday.",
        "So yeah.",
        "But before I feel too sorry for myself, you know, I am still very young, and I got to call Bond's 700th homerun, and the homerun that he passed Willie Mays with, and I called a no-hitter, and Greg Maddux's 3,000th strikeout.",
        "So for somebody who has not been doing this for very long, and is still as young like I am, I have a great job, and I've seen a lot of great moments.",
        "So while I - I regret that it happened and I'm very, very disappointed that the call is not on record, you know, I try not to feel too sorry for myself",
        "And I think you also know, you've worked in the minor leagues, I know, and done college, as you mentioned.",
        "Despite the horrific schedule, that at the end of that game you get on a plane and fly to Miami across the country, where you must've arrived what, 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and getting ready for a game tonight, you have one of the great jobs ever.",
        "I do.",
        "You know, not only being with the Giants organization.",
        "I mean, from day to day, I'm down at the clubhouse talking to Willie Mays or Orlando Cipeda(ph) or Willie McCovey(ph) and you know, I get to watch Barry Bonds.",
        "And out ballpark, I think, is the most beautiful stadium in all of sports, and that's my home office, and I get to watch baseball.",
        "You know, today I'm sitting on the beach here in Miami.",
        "On Wednesday night, we're flying to New York for the weekend.",
