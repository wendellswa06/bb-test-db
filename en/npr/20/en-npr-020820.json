        "Hi.",
        "We'd also like to hear from you.",
        "If you have a favorite moment where Peter Jennings touched you, aggravated you or helped you understand the world, give us a call: (800) 989-8255; (800) 989-TALK.",
        "And the e-mail address is totn@npr.org.",
        "And Robert Krulwich is with us from ABC News headquarters.",
        "And we knew Peter Jennings from watching him on the television as a cool, collected anchor, a man who could truly think on his feet, and also understood more mundane stories.",
        "What was he like as a person?",
        "How did you know him?",
        "He was pretty unusual--in a way it's very hard to describe.",
        "But he was just big.",

        "His talents were big.",
        "His insecurities were big.",

        "He would think faster, kind of--he would think past you.",
        "He would whack you in the back if he thought that you were being weak.",
        "You know, not fleet-footed enough.",
        "And so there was a sense about this guy that he was--the closest I can get to it is if you happened to wander into the Iliad and actually met one of those Greek kings who just swaggered through life, Peter had a swagger, and I don't think I ever ran into anybody quite like him in that way.",
        "In that way.",
        "It takes, I think, a certain amount of swagger to take on the job that he did.",
        "Well, it's a very strange job because you are both an actor, an improvisor, a wise man.",
        "You're also a brand--I mean, think about that.",
        "You have an entire company that pretty much treats your face as its face.",
        "You have thousands of people working for you, any one of which could hand you a bad fact, a misstatement or whatever.",
        "So you have to be on your guard--you have to be a lance, you have to be all these things, and he did it with an athlete's grace.",
        "I mean, it was just fascinating to watch closely, 'cause you'd walk into a room.",
        "He'd sit down in that chair and the world would throw all these different things at him.",
        "The period of time around the World Trade Center was perhaps the most memorable example.",
        "The story was sudden, the developments were very clear and very sudden as well.",

        "`Tonight the three wise men will come,' her mother says with the wink of an eye.",
        "`They go to all the homes and bring presents.",
        "We parents have nothing to do with it.",
