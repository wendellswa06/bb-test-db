        "The red knots winter in Argentina but fly 10,000 miles to the high Arctic to breed.",

        "When a bird arrives, they are literally skin and bone, very little on them at all.",

        "Delaware is the red knots' most important feeding stop on their trip.",
        "They time their arrival to perfectly coincide with the annual horseshoe crab spawning here.",
        "The crabs lay billions of pearly-green, caviar-sized eggs.",
        "Many of these eggs would just dry out or wash away, but instead, they become a banquet for the migratory shorebirds.",
        "So the bird is feeding on really the surplus eggs in the population.",
        "It really is a case of nature's bounty that they're taking rather than the fact that the birds are stopping the crab's breeding.",
        "The red knots only have a few weeks to build up enough fat reserves to fuel their last leg of their journey.",
        "They eat so greedily that stretches of sand can be completely hidden by their red breasts and little pecking heads.",
        "By the time they are ready to go, they are like little balls - it's the best way of putting it.",
        "They are round.",
        "They look like they have short legs because they are carrying so much fat on their breast, and they almost waddle, they are so heavy.",
        "So I thought we should celebrate…",

        "She says the bounty of crab eggs in Delaware that's available only in late spring is an example of nature's mysterious synchronicity.",
        "The red knots need that fuel to get to the Arctic to breed, and they need to get there exactly when there will be plenty of food for their chicks, and that's only for two short months in the summer.",
        "Hopefully, they'll get the timing just right.",
        "It's really critical they arrive just as the snow melts, and they can lay their clutch of eggs really quickly.",
        "Then as their chicks hatch, it should be just about the same time that the insects hatch as well.",
        "So the chicks get the maximum food.",
        "But something's gone wrong for the red knots.",
        "Nigel says the population's crashed since the 1990s.",

        "There is nowhere else in the world where a population of birds is so dependent on such a small area.",

        "It's as simple as that.",
        "This year turns out to have been a pretty good year for the red knots in Delaware.",
