        "Well, Tom Tancredo said, look, if Scott McInnis or Dan Mays -those are the two Republicans who have been running for governor - if polls show they cannot beat John Hickenlooper, who is the mayor of Denver, who is the Democratic nominee for the governorship, if the polls show that neither can win, then you should get out, and if you don't get out, then I'm getting in.",
        "And the two Republicans said to Tancredo, well, we're not getting out.",
        "So he said, okay, I'll run as a candidate of the American Constitution Party.",
        "What's so strange about this is that Tancredo seems to be so afraid that Hickenlooper, the Democrat, could win the governorship, but him running as a third-party candidate - guaranteed to split conservative votes -would help the Democrats anyway.",
        "Tancredo, former member of Congress, ran for president in 2008 on a strict anti-illegal-immigration ticket.",
        "The American Constitution Party is really pretty conservative, to say the least.",
        "It wants to, I think, abolish the 20th century.",
        "But anyway, so Tancredo, whatever he's doing, that battle we just heard with Dick Wadhams, the chairman of the Republican Party, is going to hurt Republican chances in Colorado.",
