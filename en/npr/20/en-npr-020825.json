        "I wanted to ask Mr. Romanoff if he would be willing to go on the record and pledge not to take PAC money if and when he wins as U.S.",

        "Thank you, Craig.",
        "Yes, I make that pledge here.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Mr. Bennet - I'm sorry, Mr. Romanoff, I am a -I'm a Democrat in Denver, and I'm fairly new to Colorado.",
        "And I went to the caucuses, and I saw that my - many of my neighbors were supporting you.",
        "But my concern is that the Democratic Party has worked so hard to turn Colorado into a blue state over the last four, five, six years, and my concern is that your campaign has really portrayed Senator Bennet in quite a negative light, and how will you feel if you are the candidate, or if he is the candidate, and then the Democrats lose this election and lose this Senate seat, sort of because of some of the negative campaigning that's taken place in Colorado?",
        "I accept part of your premise.",
        "You're right that we've worked hard - I've worked hard, frankly, to lead the first Democratic majority in the House in 30 years.",
        "I built the largest Democratic majority Colorado has seen since John Kennedy was president.",
        "I'm proud of that effort, and I intend to keep Colorado blue.",
        "I wouldn't be running, obviously, if I not only thought I had the best ability to serve but also the best chance to win.",
        "And it's telling that in spite of the nearly $5 million my opponent has sunk into this campaign over the last 18 months, I do better than he does against both of the leading Republican candidates.",
        "So I submit if you want to hold this seat in November, you'd be better to nominate me.",
        "I also take exception to the description the caller offered of the advertising we're running.",
        "It's true, we point out that my opponent is one of the top recipients of Wall Street cash and big oil money.",
        "We also pointed out that he voted to protect tax breaks for big oil companies and against a proposal that would have prevented banks from becoming too big to fail."

        "No, it's nice to be with you, thanks.",
        "Same question to you that we put to Mr. Romanoff: What differentiates you from him as a candidate?",
        "Well, you know, I'd answer the question the same way whether Andrew was in the race or not, which is that I have not spent my life in politics.",
        "This is the first time I've ever run for office before.",
        "I think that probably shows.",
        "But I bring a lifetime of experience outside of politics, in business and most recently in leading a reform effort of the Denver public schools as the superintendent.",
        "And I think that one of the things I've detected about this town is that it's not a place that's very long on practical experience.",
        "There's a lot of well-intentioned legislation that's passed that by the time it gets, for example, to a classroom in our country, it makes very little sense to the teacher and the kids that are there.",
        "So I've tried to bring a perspective that's based on being outside of politics, being on the receiving end of people's ideas there, and I think that's of use to Colorado."

        "Ken Rudin?",
        "Senator Bennet, when you were first appointed to the seat, and obviously there was a long list of Democrats who would have loved that appointment, a lot of people said that the only reason there's a primary right here is ambition, the fact that Romanoff wasn't appointed to the seat and wanted it badly and you got the appointment instead, do you see it as just a thwarted ambition, or do you see a real difference of -between two candidates?",
        "I have yet to detect a material policy difference between the two candidates, and my focus throughout the primary before there was a primary and to today is exactly the same and unchanged.",
        "And it's attempting to try to create a Washington that's responsive to an American public that is going through the worst recession since the Great Depression, and coming out, by the way, a period of economic growth over the last 10 years, when it was the first time in our country's history that our economy grew and median family income fell.",
        "That has created an incredible dislocation in Colorado and across the United States.",
        "In Colorado, families are earning a thousand dollars less on average than they were 10 years ago, and their cost of health insurance has gone up 97 percent.",
        "Their cost of higher education has gone up by 50 percent.",
        "So there is an anxiety that, collectively, we are a part of the generation that may be the first generation of Americans to leave less opportunity, not more, to our kids and our grandkids.",
        "That's the perspective that I brought irrespective of whether there's been a primary or not.",

        "Jolene, you're on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Hi.",
        "Senator Bennet, I'm curious about - and I feel like one of the most important things right now that we need from a senator is the ability to work across the aisle.",
        "And I think we all know many of the votes oftentimes are across party lines.",
        "What I would like to find out from you is what are some specific examples you can give us of how you have reached across the party lines?",
        "Thanks, Jolene.",
        "I appreciate it very much.",
        "Just today, I testified in front of the Rules Committee.",
        "I was invited to testify there about some proposals I've made to change the filibuster rules.",
        "And those proposals are unique because they are designed to do exactly what you described, which is inspire people to work across the line, across the partisan line, rather than have the hyperpartisanship that's going on in Washington.",
        "So you can get information about that rule on the website.",
        "All right.",
        "So Steve, I'm in Texas...",
        "Two other specific examples, we recently just passed a bill that I introduced last year called the Pay it Back Act that said that the money that was sent back, paid back by the financial institutions in this country, the TARP money, should be used dollar for dollar for deficit reduction.",
        "That was a bill that - Senator Corker from Tennessee and I were the original cosponsors on it - passed with broad bipartisan support, and is now the law of the land.",
        "The last piece I'd mention here is the bill called Troops to Teachers, which will make it easier for our returning veterans to serve in America's classrooms.",
        "John McCain and I are the original cosponsors of that legislation."

        "We're under-serving our veterans that are living in rural areas, and a high percentage of returning vets end up living in rural areas.",
        "In Colorado, we're trying to make progress by making sure that we've got the funding in place that we need to serve not just the returning vets from Afghanistan and Iraq, but from the wars that you mentioned, as well.",
        "I've also seen some incredible examples in our state of telemedicine, which is allowing veterans to have checkups and other things without having to drive long distances to Denver or other places.",
        "So this is very much on my mind, and any veterans that are listening can go to my website.",

        "One, Andrew Romanoff has accused you of being - of basically taking PAC money from everybody, and that's part of why you have raised so much money and - your response to that?",
        "And two, obviously, President Obama was pretty popular two years ago.",
        "He carried Colorado, the first Democrat to do that in a long time.",

        "Well, the first - the answer to the first question, first of all, is that if you look at the entire congressional delegation in Colorado, I have - as a percentage of the total amount of money I've raised, raised the least percentage from political action committees, and in fact - except for Jared Polis, who doesn't take PAC money at all - and in fact, as a percentage, less than half of some of the people in the delegation.",

        "And in the face of those difficulties, they scratch their heads and wonder why everybody back in Washington is screaming at each other.",
