        "Oh, I remember that well, yes, indeed.",
        "The sonar operator is a very important part of the plotline.",
        "Yup, yup, and you know, they did such a good job because they didn't show anything too technical or specific, but they were able to dramatize the job.",
        "It's not actually something that Russian submarines did, but we would every now and again call the officer of the deck and ask him to conduct the Crazy Ivan.",
