        "Thank you very much.",
        "And you wrote on the blog: Oscars can be deadly stuffy, lame, irrelevant and pretentious, both haughty and ingratiating at the same time.",
        "This time around, though, you think it came off fairly well.",
        "I think it came off fairly well.",
        "A lot of that I think had to do with who was winning and how some of the winners came off, as opposed to maybe the production of the actual show.",
        "But yeah, I mean, I think a lot of the winners were likeable and gave nice speeches, and people felt good about a lot of those winners.",
        "And a lot of, you know, folks who, even in the case of somebody like Sandra Bullock, who a lot of people disagreed with the award maybe, she was likeable.",
        "She gave a great speech."

        "They were sort of all good, so...",
        "Have they shortened the speeches?",
        "I mean, it seemed unless you were getting Best Picture or Best Actor or Best Actress, you got about five seconds.",
        "It's really hard to tell.",
        "They vary.",
        "It seems like some were shorter, and some weren't shorter, and they had this plan this year where they were going to have this thank you cam set up backstage so that you could go and thank your agent and your lawyer for the Internet-only audience, and perhaps the TV audience would be spared.",
        "And I think maybe it helped a little bit.",
        "They wanted the acceptance speeches to focus a little bit more on substance of what the award meant to you.",
        "It helped a little, but I don't know that it changed the scope that much.",
        "And shorter with the songs, longer on, well, there 10 nominees.",
        "We had to have 10 presentations for Best Picture.",
        "Right.",
        "They had to introduce all they do, you know, the little presentations of each of the 10 Best Picture nominees, and they did cut this year the performances of Original Song, which have, you know, traditionally been included, some good performances, some disastrous performances, depending on the year.",
        "So but they the more nominees, the more of those presentations you sit through, for sure.",
        "And I have to say, I was on a plane for much of the broadcast, one of those planes that does not get television programming.",
        "Sure."

        "It's an extremely difficult job, and almost nobody ever comes off fantastically well.",
        "Steve Martin has done it before and I think is a really good host.",
        "And I think, for the most part, their jokes were, I would say, better than average.",
        "They sort of vanished.",
        "They weren't on the later parts of the show all that much, but I think the parts that they did were perfectly good, judging on a curve, you know.",

        "A lot of people expected \"\"The Hurt Locker\"\" to win.",
        "Yeah, but none of the really big awards, I think, were surprises.",

        "Hurt Locker\"\" had picked up a couple of big guild awards and things like that that tend to be signs of what's to come.",
        "So I think by the time that happened, \"\"The Hurt Locker\"\" was probably the odds-on favorite.",
        "I don't think there were any big surprises among any of the major winners, as a matter of fact.",
        "We should note, those of us who were following the coverage of the Best Documentary Features, we had interviews about all of them.",
