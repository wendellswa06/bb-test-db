        "And of course, this is something that has not been popular among teachers unions, so to have a Democratic president in place and actually backing that royals them a little bit, I think, because they supported this president and of course, you have to remember the federal government is not going to dictate how much individual teachers get paid.",
        "They'll hand out performance grants as they have been doing under the Bush administration - there was a teacher incentive fund under the last administration - and then some districts will use that money and they'll incorporate them into their contracts, and the teachers will probably have to agree to most of these changes.",

        "A lot of federally-guaranteed loans go through private banks.",
