        "Like Mr. Greenspan, he doesn't think the Fed should be moving interest rates to burst stock market or real estate bubbles.",

        "Advocates of inflation targeting say setting a rule like this, which actually is pretty similar to the way the Fed has actually operated, might make it easier for Mr. Bernanke to continue Mr. Greenspan's success as a monetary policy-maker.",

        "Is there any indication that Bernanke will try to make the Fed a more transparent operation?",

        "For one thing, he talks all the time about how important it is to be transparent and to be clear about what the Fed is doing and what their objectives are.",

        "There are several famous entertainment films--these are not documentaries, but made for popular entertainment--that just--foosh!--start with the bomb and the mushroom cloud, and that's where the story starts because Japan has lived through it and can speak about the aftermath, whereas the United States, never having lived through it, must end with the bomb and the big explosion because we're not really comfortable looking with what happened after.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Now you worked closely with this artist that we've been talking about, curator Takashi Murakami.",

        "Right.",
        "His thesis is that the violence of the atomic bombs and the war in general, because they could not find an outlet in the fine arts in postwar Japan, made their way into the consciousness of the next generation via these animation and manga.",
        "Atom Boy\"\" would be a great example of an extremely popular children's program that directly references the atomic bomb.",
        "What happened is that these children watched these, you know, television entertainments and read these manga and then grew up in the '60s and the '70s subliminally aware of the sort of ensuing issues.",
        "In addition to--I mean, what happened--the otaku kind of emerged in the late '70s as adults.",
        "They were steeped in these images and, in Murakami's words, he characterizes otaku--super geeks, if you will...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...by a relentless self-reference to a humiliated self.",
        "They were obsessed with what was then considered uncool, these homegrown cultures of anime and manga.",
        "In addition then, what otaku grew up with were the fundamental contradictions of why Japan remained dependent on the country that dropped the atomic bombs and defeated Japan militarily; also why Japan, one of the few countries in the world--one of two countries in the world that has a peace constitution forswearing war, also has a self-defense force.",
        "The parents of these children were at a loss to explain these fundamental contradictions to their children because they themselves couldn't understand them.",

        "Steve joins us on the line from Salem, Oregon.",
        "Yeah, I have a question.",
        "I'm interested in the self-loathing culture that the Japanese perceive themselves in, in light of the news censorships and blackouts that were happening especially from '43 on when they weren't getting any information, that they were this defeating, losing--defeated, losing nation, that everything was fine, that they were winning the war.",
        "When did all this start?",
        "How did they--you know, what was the essence of the time frame?",
        "Well, you're correct, it was Japanese military censorship through the early '40s, and then, of course, there was United States occupation censorship which prohibited really any images of the war or the bombs.",
        "And so it wasn't until really the mid-'50s that any of these images could be legitimately portrayed.",
        "And so I think, in a sense, it took the Japanese a long time to catch up with not only the legacy of their own militarism, but also the legacy of the bombs and their humiliating defeat.",
        "Thank you."
