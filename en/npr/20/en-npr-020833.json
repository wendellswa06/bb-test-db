        "Happy to be here, Neal.",
        "We've been talking with Linda Hoaglund about some of the effects on Japanese culture.",
        "How do you think the bombs manifest themselves in American culture?",
        "Well, gee, there are lots of ways that the bombs manifest themselves in American culture.",
        "The initial reaction in the United States was one of great joy that the war had ended, and that kind of emphasized the fact that Pearl Harbor had initiated the war and that there had been lots of Japanese atrocities.",
        "And that continues to appear in American culture.",
        "There are people who feel no regret about the dropping of the bomb.",
        "There are even people who feel proud of the dropping of the bomb.",
        "But at the same time that this feeling took shape, there was a reaction which I would call a strong reaction of apprehension.",
        "A lot of the clergymen in the United States and a lot of intellectuals warned the United States not to be too proud and warned that there was something to fear now that the energy of the universe had been tapped for purposes of war.",
        "And that apprehension reaction, I think, is the key thing which has continued in American culture.",
        "And even the people who feel proud of the atomic bomb, I think, nonetheless have been influenced by the fact that apprehension becomes a basic feature of American life.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Well, did that have to do with the--you know, unleashing the atomic genie, if you will, or the fears of the Cold War which followed not long thereafter?",
        "It had to do with both.",
        "The initial statement made by Robert Oppenheimer, who had developed the bomb, quoted from two figures in the Bhagavad-Gita.",
        "One of them refers to the radiance of 1,000 suns, the forces of creation, and the other refers to the energies of destruction.",
        "Krishna says, `I am time grown old to destroy the world,' and I think that feeling that something basic had changed was one thing.",
        "At first, it was funny because it was like the reality show of the presidency."

        "But of course, some people think that one of the points of the atomic bombings was to demonstrate to our future Cold War enemy that we possessed the atomic bomb.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And that, of course, led to the apprehension that other people would possess the atomic bomb and would use them against us.",
        "So a lot of Cold War energy is devoted to preventing the Soviets, who developed the atomic bomb in '49, and then devoted to preventing the Soviets from developing the hydrogen bomb, which they do very quickly after we developed the hydrogen bomb.",

        "In regards to this concept of self-loathing for Japan in modern Japan, I don't see a connection.",
        "Being in Japan, I noticed that, you know, other than the normal understanding that it is a very patriarchal society, that this idea of self-loathing seems to be, I would say, antiquated.",
        "You have an administration now that is actually forthright in its idea that it can project itself as a power.",
        "Do you think that the idea of self-loathing is more of an outdated premise at this point considering Japan's very long history?",
        "Linda Hoaglund, I think that's to you.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, yes, certainly the current Japanese administration is beginning to rattle its sabers, but I think in part, it's a direct reaction to the fact that Japan has for 60 years been utterly militarily dependent on the United States, and that what Murakami posits is that this military political dependence on the United States leads to a sense of impotence.",
        "But...",
        "And it's this sense of impotence that the current Japanese administration is attempting to exploit...",
        "Japan's neighbors don't feel that they are impotent.",

        "Hello, everyone.",
        "Yeah.",
        "My question, I guess, or comment is, you know, you look at Japan from prior to World War II, like, you know, 1937, 1935, prior, it was basically the code of the warrior, the Bushido code that was prevalent.",
        "And then I guess now--and I can see where your guests are--I can see the comments that your guests are making are accurate, that they go to this cartoon culture almost.",
        "I was stationed over there when I was in the Navy a little bit, and it really is prevalent.",
        "And then, you know, you look at the art, the early Japanese art with the lovely lines and the emphasis on form, you know, and, like, the one pine tree and stuff, and then you look at the later culture from the '60s, '70s and '80s on.",
        "And I'd just like to have your comments on that.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Linda Hoaglund.",
        "Well, I think--I guess what I would say is that part of what Japan is struggling with is that indeed Japanese culture was very much a warrior culture and a Bushido culture, and this led directly into their aggression into China in the early '30s.",
        "There's no question about that.",
        "What happened with the imposition of the US peace constitution and the US occupation--all of that came to a completely screeching halt and was deemed inappropriate.",
        "And so there was a new--democracy was imposed and the Japanese had to completely reinvent themselves.",
        "And I suppose some people would argue that they threw the baby out with the bathwater and that Japanese culturally are somewhat in limbo now wondering if they had to jettison and exorcise everything from before World War II.",
        "Yeah, fascinating.",

        "Well, it is in lots of ways.",

        "When \"\"Saving Private Ryan\"\" came out, there was a film about the Pacific, and it didn't succeed with the populace, although it did succeed with critics.",
        "And I think it was because Vietnam tended to evoke images of the nuclear destruction.",
        "There were scenes in it of flame-bombing, and that just didn't play well.",

        "24\"\" ran a very, very elegant series about an Islamist group which was plotting all kinds of destruction.",
        "The War of Worlds\"\" not only includes that plot but also refers to the terrorist threat and sort of brings to the surface a lot things that have been latent in America's reaction to terrorism.",
        "And I went to see \"\"Batman Begins\"\" last night, and there it was again.",

        "We just wanted to say `nuke 'em' to take care of the people that had attacked us.",
        "And yet--so that really wouldn't have solved anything, but yet that's our reflex as Americans.",
