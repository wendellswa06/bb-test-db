        "Well, it's obviously a contraction of nuclear, but one of the things that's true is that language tends to inform the way we think.",
        "I mean, if you speak about `nuking 'em'--we even talk about microwaving things as `nuking it'--and given all of the fear and loathing that nuclear destruction has created in the United States and the decades spent on making sure that nuclear deterrents would take place and nuclear disarmament would take place, it's actually kind of interesting, as your caller suggests, that that's become a casual idiom, meaning anything from `destroy 'em' to `microwave it.'",
        "Hmm.",
        "Kim, thanks for the observation.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Later today, a documentary called \"\"Original Child Bomb\"\" about the human cost of the nuclear bomb airs on the Sundance Channel.",
        "In it, the filmmaker spoke to a class of New York City teen-agers after showing archival footage of Nagasaki and Hiroshima before and after the bomb.",

        "Unidentified Teen: The possibility of any kind of nuclear war--I don't think it's even remotely any type of reality for this generation.",
        "It's something that's of the past and it seems like it's something that is in the future, but not something that affects us.",
        "For a new generation, this film suggests that this is the legacy of the bomb.",
        "Joining us now is Ayana Osada.",
        "She is co-producer of the documentary \"\"Original Child Bomb.\"\" She's with us by phone from New York City.",
        "Nice of you to join us today on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Glad to be here.",
        "Thank you.",
        "What did you find from your interviews of young people, both in the US and Japan?",
        "Generally, the students, teen-agers, in New York were shocked and saddened by the tragedy that took place, both in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and were, or had been, unaware of the details at least of the tragedies.",
        "And in Japan, of course, we all grew up learning much more about these incidents, tragedies, than I believe the children in the US.",
        "But even the 13-year-old Japanese boy who worked with us on the film was somewhat afraid to actually go to Hiroshima with our director and was, again, saddened to be there and to feel the pain of many, many hibakusha, the victims, who are still alive today, who are still suffering 60 years later."

        "I wonder, we've been talking a lot about the influences of the atomic bomb explosions on Japanese culture.",
        "What do you think--what you found out from those kinds in New York, what do you think that says about how Americans deal with our atomic past?",
        "Again, as your panelists had been talking before, there is a sense of impotence, incompetence and extreme dependency of Japan on its big brother, the US, who constituted the peace constitution after the war and so forth.",
        "And so Japan always--I knew, growing up in Japan, knew that Japan looked up to America for its culture, for it subculture, for many, many things.",
        "And so it was kind of a given, I felt, that the American people, young people, today just felt like Japan was, you know, a little brother and a friendly country.",
        "And they were, again, shocked to find out the details and really each story, having an incredibly emotional sense of what are the consequences of the bombs.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF AD)",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "As a Japanese person--as you said, you grew up there--I wonder, do you agree with Murakami's argument about postwar Japan?",
        "It sounds as if you do.",
        "I do.",
        "And I think, to go further, this whole otaku culture or the timid expression of the hidden anger and the questioning of these contradictions that Linda had eloquently expressed before...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...I think all of this is sort of pointing us to come to a point where we could maybe find out what exactly happened and what are the pains that people felt on both sides.",
        "And I really think that had we recognized that the pains did not have to be mutually exclusive, as in you can be patriotic Japanese or American and still know what happened on these days.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And that's what we're trying to do with our film.",
        "I wonder, Japan would have been devastated by the fire bombings alone.",
        "Even if the atomic bombings had never happened, Japan would have been defeated if the atomic bombs had never been dropped.",
        "What particularly about Japanese culture do you think reflects the atomic aspect of the defeat that did happen?"

        "Where I was in school and we were learning about World War II, I had read--well, we called them comic books, but it was called--I think it's Barefoot Gen.",
        "I'm not sure if I'm saying it right.",
        "But it had such a tremendous impact on the way that I understood the effects of the nuclear bomb and what actually happened to the people as it's told from the point of view of a young child.",
        "And seeing these graphic images almost, you know, in comic book form of people with their skin just melting off their face, it was something that just had a huge impact on the way I viewed the war and what happened.",
        "It was no longer an abstraction; it was very clear.",
        "And I was wondering if you could talk about things like that and, unfortunately, how maybe rare that education is in our culture.",
        "Well, for the first part, let's go to Linda Hoaglund.",
        "Yes.",
        "Thank you for bringing up Barefoot Gen.",
        "In addition to being a graphic novel, it's also a very, very powerful animated film.",
        "And the footage from that film of the moment when the author, who was five years old, looked down at a stone and the bomb exploded behind him, killing his parents, is, to me, the most powerful image of the atomic bomb that I've ever seen.",
        "And it actually led me to muse whether or not the power of animation in Japan is a direct result of the bomb and trying to devise a way of looking at what is unwatchable.",
        "So that--it's not an accident that animation became so popular, because it became the only way that you could actually look at and imagine what had happened and the Armageddon.",
        "What do you think, Ayana?"

        "And I really would strongly urge anyone to--you know, who has the chance to watch our film, to look at this scene, because like Linda said, I believe this is one of the images that has always stayed with me as a child, growing up, because we all watched this or read this comic book.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "We're talking about the atomic echoes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 60 years after the bombing of Nagasaki.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Marianna Torgovnick, I wanted to bring you in on this phone call, as well, on the aspect that Elizabeth was talking about in terms of education of Americans.",
        "The education for Americans on the atomic bombings is very spotty, and one of the things that I've found in my work is that a lot of World War II memory resides through the family, and a lot of World War II memory is different, depending on which coast you grew up in.",
        "On the West Coast, people are much more likely to be attuned to things like Japanese--the internment camps for Japanese-Americans and much more likely to be attuned to the atomic bombings.",
        "On the East Coast, while those things are certainly known and the internment camps increasingly known since the 1970s, there tends to be an emphasis on Holocaust education, and it's education into the Holocaust which tends to come first.",
        "As I say, a lot of World War II memory comes through the family, and the film which was done sounds absolutely amazing, but I--it would be interesting to see whether West Coast teen-agers would say exactly the same thing that the East Coast teen-agers said.",
        "Both will have a chance to see it later today when it's on its American debut on the Sundance Channel.",
        "I did want to ask you, Linda Hoaglund--you're a senior film curator as well.",
        "You're making--doing a project now on Japanese films, \"\"After War...\"\" What characterizes the difference between Japanese films before and after the war?",
        "While Oneita makes breakfast, she smiles as Clive describes his old job packaging single-serving coffee creamers like the ones the church uses.",
        "I'm one of the best operator on this, me and a guy from Russia.",
        "He's a immigrant like me, too.",
        "He barely speak English.",
        "Well, I would say that it's not so much a broad characterization of the difference.",
        "I mean, certainly, during the war there were plenty of propaganda films that were made, and there wasn't that long a stretch before the war between silent films and talkies, although Japan already had a very strong film studio business in place.",
        "The series that I've curated that we're going to be showing at the Japan Society starting on September 27th, \"\"After War...,\"\" simply illustrates my position, which is that, in fact, Japanese filmmakers have grappled with memories of war, memories of aggression, memories of defeat and of the bomb in really, literally, hundreds of films, both that deal with the war directly and indirectly.",
        "And there are so many of these films.",
        "And I suppose part of it is that Japan is constantly being accused of never having come to terms with its own aggression with the war, and I would argue that many filmmakers, and not just art filmmakers and documentarians but also popular entertainment directors, have really grappled with the war in such imaginative ways that we're just going to show six of them.",
        "And we hope that any of you who are in New York, or not, will come to New York to come and see these films.",
        "Let's see if we can get one more caller in before we have to go.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I was kind of interested as I was thinking about it--my grandparents and my parents were alive when the bombs were dropped, and you're seeing that, you know, the culture in Japan became a self-loathing culture in the young people directly after that.",
        "I find it interesting, as the caller before me, when she was explaining that, you know, comic books and things taught her about what happened--we had also very graphic teachings in our school about what happened and how horrible it was, I mean, I would say from fourth grade onward.",
        "And it's interesting to me that my generation is the one having the issues with this self-loathing--you know, with the grunge music and, you know, really negative self-images and things like that.",
