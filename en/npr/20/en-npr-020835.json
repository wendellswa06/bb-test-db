        "But even then, it wasn't the whole country, it was only a specific region of the country that was affected; and if you had family members down there, then that issue touched more than anything else.",
        "But I think we're going to really have to now work on ways of connecting the varying issues that affect our daily lives and find a way to coordinate those activities so that we can bring holistic solutions to whole problems, because that's how we're living these days.",

        "At the first convention in 2004, we laid out a collective agenda that was comprised of what everyone was working on from a city level.",
        "But now we have to move beyond just saying what it is.",
        "We have to actually be about working together and getting past a lot of the personal issues, and then raising the funds that allows our organizing activities to move forward successfully so that we can be consistent in how we address these things nationally."

        "So that, for example, when we think about the issue of jobs, it's not just minimum wage jobs or just living wage jobs that we have to push for.",

        "I went to the first convention, or the convention in 2004 in New Jersey.",

        "So if this is how black Americans feel about Hip Hop, how can you use it as a tool for change?",
        "Well, a couple of things.",
        "I wanted to just say that there are a lot of intergenerational dialogues happening both in Chicago and nationally.",
        "So that step has been taken to close the gap.",
        "But to answer your question, I think the outlook and the definition that the black community and the general public has about Hip Hop points to the power of media and the power that media has in defining whatever it seeks to put its attention towards."

        "I know that Hip Hop has the power to change lives, because it has changed lives for the better of millions of folks not only in this country, but internationally.",
        "I think the problem is that we have to start reading between the lines and making sure that we are not simply being told what Hip Hop is or who we are as a people by what popular media says, but actually go back to the communities, back to the streets, back to the peoples who are kind of the purveyors or the keepers of culture, who are maintaining hip-hop and any other element of black culture for its purity and the positive effects that it has on the community and start to champion that.",
        "Angela, does your group fund or work with or help hip-hop generation advocacy groups?",
        "We are a research action policy institute, advancing strategies and policies that build a fully inclusive society, and in doing our work, we always work with local leaders and local change agents to make sure that they're authentic policies that we're advancing and that there's the possibility to sustain progress over time.",

        "Well, I think by hosting the 2006 National Hip-Hop Political Convention and the partnerships that we've created - one in particular with the Chicago Freedom Movement, which is celebrating the 40th anniversary of Martin Luther King's travel to Chicago to help out with the housing discrimination issues.",
        "That in particular, that partnership is: One, helping the hip-hop generation move forward on the creating of a collective political agenda that represents our interests, and secondly, it is a demonstrated attempt at bridging the gap between generations and those leaders that have successfully fought battles before and that are still involved in the struggle today to bring that new energy and that dynamic new vision, I would suppose, to add along with it what they're doing so that we can win and not just be out here spinning our wheels.",
        "So I think the work that I'm engaged in and that my peers are engaged in every single day will kind of point to answer that question, and hopefully, the convention will help move us forward.",
