        "But that led to a lot of killings at the court, and Francis Bacon - who's most famous to us, I suppose, as an essayist, though if you're a legalist, he was also attorney general of England and lord chancellor.",
        "And he, at the beginning, in prosecuting one of the cases, said to the judges, look.",
        "This is going to stop when what he called rude mechanicals in other words, people who weren't gentlemen start doing it.",
        "The trouble was...",
        "That would be you and me, right?",
        "That would be us.",
        "The trouble is, it took several hundred years before that happened.",
        "But nevertheless, Bacon got the point right, I think, at the start of the modern duel in England, which is that it can only work to generate honor for gentlemen if only gentlemen are allowed to do it.",
        "And in fact, the fact that it was illegal was part of the point.",
        "It was the nobility claiming the privilege of acting outside the law.",
        "So - but yes.",
        "In the end, it goes away, and very swiftly, so that by the Duke of Wellington, who's the grandest Englishman, you know, of the early-19th-century duels once only, it should be said, while he's prime minister, no less.",
        "But 20, 30 years later, if somebody tries to duel, it's just ridiculous.",
        "There's a wonderful passage in Evelyn Waugh's novel \"\"Officers and Gentlemen,\"\" which is about the middle of the - sort of soldiers in the lead-up to the Second World War, into the Second World War, where one of the sort of gentlemen officers is asked what will happen if somebody challenges him to a duel.",
        "He says laugh.",
        "I'll laugh.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So - and yet 100 years before, as I say, you know, the Duke of Wellington felt he had to fight a duel because someone had accused him of doing something mildly misleading, which after all, for a politician, you know, that's a pretty standard accusation.",
        "And as you point out, though, it was a pretty safe thing to do, because the Duke of Wellington was a notoriously bad shot.",
        "He was a fantastically bad shot.",
        "There are lots of respected ladies' diaries of the period reporting all kinds of unfortunate people -including sometimes his hosts - at shooting parties who got shot."

        "And there's a famous story of a woman who was hanging out her laundry from a house on an estate, and the Duke of Wellington came by and fired a shot.",

        "So this is part of this sort of - the obvious sort of absurdity of the whole connection between dueling and class at the time, you know, this sort of weird class structure.",
        "But the point is it changed very swiftly, and by the end in fact, the Duke of Wellington was commander-in-chief of the armed forces, but he ordered the practice to be seriously punished among soldiers.",
        "So he himself turns around and became one of the people who fought against it.",
