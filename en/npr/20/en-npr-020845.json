        "And that was part of what pushed them - very swiftly, actually - into organizing these societies, these anti-foot-binding societies.",
        "And in those anti-foot-binding societies, what they did was that they, in order to sign up, you had to promise two things.",
        "If you were a woman, you had to unbind your feet, but if you were a man, you had to promise not to bind the feet of your daughters and not to allow your sons to marry women who had bound feet.",
        "And you can see that in a society where marriage is arranged and where there's an elite within which honor is very important in getting married, if you switch the code from foot-binding being a condition for marriage to being something that makes - is an obstacle to marriage and, in fact, from being honorable to being slightly shameful, then very swiftly you can turn it around.",
        "And what happened was usually, in about 20 years in most places in China, you go from, you know, the majority of elite women foot-bound to over 90 percent un-foot-bound.",
        "And so this is - as opposed to a personal thing - a collective feeling of shame and guilt.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, that's the the most powerful force - one of the most powerful forces, I think, in the world in politics is this sense of collective honor, which is very much tied up with modern nationalism.",
        "Our - you remember, our founders referred about having a decent respect of the opinions of mankind.",
        "Well, one of the opinions of mankind is about whether you're honorable or not, about whether you're worthy of respect.",
        "And if you love your country or even care about your country a little bit, you're likely to care about whether it's respected in the world.",
        "And when you see and also about whether it's entitled to respect, because the heart of honor isn't just caring about respect, though caring about honor does involve caring about being respected.",
        "The heart of honor is thinking of yourself as entitled to respect, as having earned respect and worrying about having earned disrespect by failing to do what's right.",
        "And the thing that the Chinese felt was that in binding the feet of their daughters, they were doing something that wasn't just wrong, and it wasn't just causing them disrespect.",
        "It was causing them disrespect which they had deserved, and they didn't want to deserve disrespect.",

        "And my curiosity involves not only the fact that the act is committed as a result of an infliction of somebody's honor or a family's honor, but do the sociological reasons for them - i.e., honor for one's country, personal honor - interfere with the fact that honor killings, in many ways, are associated with a religious background and if that will affect the longevity of the practice in modern culture?",
        "Good.",
        "I think that's a very important thing.",
        "And remember, just to go back for a second to what I said about dueling, dueling was clearly understood to be un-Christian from at least the ninth century.",
        "So it takes more than recognizing that something is not religious to get people to give it up when it's an honor practice.",
        "Nevertheless, as I try to argue in the book, it's an extremely important fact about honor killing - which, as you say, is very common in Muslim countries, though it's also quite common in India among people who aren't Muslim.",
        "The important fact about it is that it's clearly, I would say, the majority, by far the largest majority of authoritative Muslims sources say that it's wrong.",
        "Now, they say it's wrong for some reasons that you would respect and for some reasons that you wouldn't, but they agree that it's wrong.",
        "And I think one of the powerful forces that will move against honor killing in places like Pakistan is the recognition that it is leading to dishonoring not of Pakistan, but of Islam.",
        "And people will want to defend Muslim honor, and one of the ways they're going to have to move if they want to defend Muslim honor is to give up this immoral practice, a practice which is already understood by, you know, all the reputable Muslim scholars to be un-Islamic.",
        "There's a great passage in your book, a fascinating conversation with a mullah named Abbad(ph) at a mosque in Islamabad.",
        "To begin with, this religious teacher surrounded by his students admits that when he sees women who are not totally veiled, quote, \"\"I just want to cut them into bits or betroth them to someone.",
        "When the startled Geoffrey(ph) asked if this is consistent with Islam, the mullah blushes and falls silent for a moment.",
        "Then he looks around at his students and mumbles: Islam does not allow it, but sometimes you have to do it to set an example."

        "Yes.",
        "I mean, we have to accept that, I mean, this is a complicated and sensitive issue, of course.",
        "But again, it's true that I think there are good Muslim reasons for doing some things like stoning adulterous men and women that we think you shouldn't do, and I believe we're correct.",
        "And, of course, many Muslims think that they don't want to do it, either.",
        "But I think what one has to remember about that is that the reason why Islam teaches that stoning to death is the right punishment for adultery is that the prophet was influenced by the Old Testament, by the Torah.",
        "And in the Torah, it says that you should stone people for adultery.",
        "And it's true that in the New Testament, Christians are turned against this because Christ says let him who is without sin cast the first stone.",
        "But you'll notice, he doesn't say don't cast the stone.",
        "What he says is, you can only cast it if you're without sin.",
        "So the idea - so what's happened is we've given up stoning for adultery, right.",
        "I mean, there is no Christian leader in this country or anywhere else, as far as I'm aware, who defends stoning for adultery.",
        "And as far as I'm aware, there's no serious Jewish scholars or rabbis who defend it.",
        "But it's in our texts, and it's in the Muslim texts, too.",
        "And I believe that just as we have found ways to live with these texts without doing everything that's in then, so Islam will move in that direction.",
        "My point about honor killing, though, is it isn't even in the texts, and nor is the other - one of the other great problems in some parts of the Muslim world, which is female genital cutting.",

        "Exactly.",
        "You know, you look at honor.",
        "It looks like it's violent, it's undemocratic, it's illegal, it's immoral, it's irreligious, and your first thought is let's get rid of it.",

        "And so, rather than the revolution of trying to go against our natures and abandon this concern with respect, let's work in every culture and on every issue to try and reshape on it, to put it in the direction of supporting what's right, of supporting morality, as it does already in many cases.",
        "One of - all -almost all the honor codes in the world, for example, are aligned in defense of the truth.",

        "Well, there's a case where honor and morality are on the same side, and we can move honor on to the side of morality in other cases as well.",
        "And as I say, I believe that that is already happening in Pakistan.",

        "She said about the case you mentioned, what sort of honor is it to open fire on an unarmed woman?",

        "And shifting honor so that it's clear what's dishonorable about that is part of the way that Pakistan and many other countries where there are still honor killing will move, I believe, in the coming years.",
        "And my reason for hope is that just as it only took a short generation to move from dueling being required to being ridiculous, and just as it took only a short generation for foot binding to move from being something that every girl of good family had to do to something that no girl of good family should do, so we can move, I hope, swiftly to a world without honor killing.",
        "Here's an email from Jeremy(ph) in Athens, Ohio.",
        "Does honor have any objective basis or is it merely relative to one's culture?",
        "If it is not objective, then does it fall short of moral concepts just as right-wrong?",
        "It seems this is a difference between the wrongness of slavery and the examples of honor killing discussed so far.",
        "I think that, in general, as I said, honor is an entitlement to respect.",
        "Some entitlements to respect come from morality.",
        "Human dignity is an entitlement to respect that I believe every human being has in virtue of moral demands.",
        "In that case, what honor requires in respecting human dignity is what morality requires.",
        "But there are other cases where honor, as I said, runs against morality.",
        "And still yet, cases which we haven't talked about, where honor is important in motivating people to do things.",
