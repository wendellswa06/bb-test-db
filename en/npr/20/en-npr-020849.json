        "And then when the protein meets another protein...",
        "It kind of grabs on to that protein, and they both kink up together.",
        "This can lead to a chain reaction that produces clumps of misfolded proteins, and these clumps are toxic to brain cells.",

        "They are called beta-amyloid and tau.",

        "Because, in a way, they suffer a transformation that has some similarities.",
        "In each disease, proteins misfold and form toxic clumps.",
        "So Goni and his colleagues decided to go after these clumps without worrying about which misfolded proteins they contain.",
