        "And some of those incidents that we've seen in Afghanistan where innocent people were apparently killed in attempts to hit, you know, Taliban remnants or al-Qaida fighters.",
        "Those have also - kinds of attacks have also happened on Pakistani soil with the same kind of repercussions, how dare you.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "We've seen in Pakistan, which certainly compared to Afghanistan was, until quite recently, very stable.",
        "We've seen suicide bombings, which are new in Pakistan.",
        "They didn't used to have them there.",
        "There's now almost every week you read the news out of, particularly, these northwest provinces along the tribal belt with Afghanistan.",
        "There are suicide bombings inside Pakistan.",
        "There have been assassination attempts against Musharraf and his prime minister, attacks within the last year on, for example, army bases inside Pakistan.",
        "So mounting instability inside Pakistan.",
        "And I think this is probably - certainly a factor in the rethinking that is going on in Washington as, you know, President Musharraf has been seen as the person who could deliver stability.",

        "Thank you.",
        "And I want to ask you - begin by asking you how much trouble is President Musharraf in?",
        "I think it's very serious, and I think this has been brewing for some time.",
        "The point was this is an election year.",
        "He - Musharraf had to stand for election for another five years.",
        "He wants to remain president for another five years.",
        "He wants to keep his army uniform and he wants to have another general election in which there would be applied parliament.",
        "Now everybody predicted that this would be a very difficult year for him, unless he's capable as a military ruler of reinventing himself.",
        "That is, you know, he's been around for eight years.",
        "He needed to completely reinvent himself in order to convince people that he was the best thing going.",
        "And clearly, he just hasn't been able to do that.",
        "And out of the woodwork has come this controversy over the chief justice, which has been quite amazing simply because the chief justice is hardly this person who most Pakistanis would even recognized or know about.",
        "Yet he's leading this massive movement now, which has been going on for three months and shows no signs of abating whatsoever.",
        "So I think Musharraf is in deep trouble.",
        "This is the supreme justice of the Pakistani Supreme Court who was fired, basically, by President Musharraf.",
        "If I'm getting the story not completely wrong, basically for quibbling with the idea that General Musharraf should be allowed to stay on for another five years?",
        "Well, exactly.",
        "What happened was, Musharraf called him in along with five other generals and asked the chief justice of the Supreme Court to resign.",
        "And the chief justice uncharacteristically refused to resign, and Musharraf then had him suspended and the case is now going on in the Supreme Court about that suspension.",
        "And he may, in fact, be reinstated again, which would cause bigger trouble for Musharraf."

        "Now the reason Musharraf wanted him to resign was that he didn't trust him in the build-up to the elections, because during this whole next six months there would be petitions to the Supreme Court - are saying that what Musharraf was doing was illegal, it was against the Constitution.",
        "And he wanted a chief justice there who would just throw these petitions out and allow Musharraf to do what he wanted to do.",

        "Freebie.",
        "I just like to say that in Pakistan, really, definitely is the epicenter of the war on al-Qaida.",
        "And I think even though Pervez Musharraf is definitely not a democratic leader, he's definitely important enough that we should support him, basically, because democracy is not always - does not always start with, you know, democratic elections and then everything goes from there.",
        "If you look at Gaza, for example, there were democratic elections; an extremist government was elected and civil war ensued.",

        "Many people would point out that they were many, many problems in the country, that it was an economic basket case, among other things.",
        "Clearly, the partnerships with Taliban and other extremist elements were not to the West's liking.",
        "Musharraf would argue that he was reelected in the most recent elections.",
        "But clearly, those were probably not elections that were exactly to the standard of the West.",

        "I mean, Musharraf - actually this protest was started by Benazir Bhutto in the '90s, but Musharraf has allowed more and more, especially TV news channels, to start up.",
        "But I think, you know, the army was really flummoxed by these live showing of the chief justice's speeches, his processions, and these live talk shows that were being held, in which a lot of people castigated the army for, you know, acting the way it was.",
        "So I think the army has really been taken by surprise by the extent of this media coverage.",
