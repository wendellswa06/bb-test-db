        "And that raises a question, which is the centrality of the army presence that President Musharraf, we call him sometimes, General Musharraf, the rest of time.",
        "He is the head of government, the head of state and the head of the armed forces.",
        "Right.",
        "And, you know, let's not make any bones about it.",
        "He's a military ruler.",
        "And increasingly so, one of the interesting things about the -that the argument that he makes that he's an enlightened moderate - was indeed the move that he made against the media, which Ahmed was talking about just now.",
        "You know, he decided that he was going to issue an emergency ordinance.",
        "He largely rules by decree.",
        "Cracking down on the electronic media, he apparently have been offended by live TV coverage of the judge's rallies, particularly a seminar in Islamabad, in which the judge was heard saying power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.",
        "And this allowed the regulatory authorities in Pakistan to seal the premises and suspend the licenses of broadcasters without any mechanism for those broadcasters to put their side of the story.",
        "Now, interestingly, the journalists then took to the streets, making this a wider protest movement against Musharraf.",
        "But Musharraf withdrew that order.",
        "And I think that's the first significant climb-down from him we've seen since the crisis began.",
        "Let me read to you an email that we got that raises a couple of points.",
        "I want Ahmed Rashid to weigh in into this as well.",
        "This is from Alex(ph) in Wichita, Kansas.",
        "(Reading) Most Pakistanis do not want a fundamentalist Islamic regime in power.",
        "Quite frankly, that's not the only substitute to Musharraf's dictatorship.",
        "He has the Western world terrified with the portrayal of his government as the last and only frontier against the Taliban, like fundamentalists taking over the government and getting control of the nuclear weapons, simply because Musharraf happens to be a strategic ally, does not make him any less of a dictator.",
        "And Ahmed Rashid, let me ask you.",
        "There has been a certain point of saying after he made the apocalypse, is General Musharraf the only alternative in terms - or the radical Islamists standing next in line?",
        "No, I don't think so.",
        "I mean, I mean what this whole protest movement over the last three months shows is that the Pakistani middleclass is - are, you know, are democratically minded.",
        "I mean, they want an end to military rule and they want free and fair elections.",
        "Now, you couldn't have a more proper and basic demand, which would be acceptable by, for example, the Bush administration anywhere else in the world.",
        "Nobody here is demanding Sharia or Islamic law or an Islamic system.",
        "William D'Antonio, a fellow at the Life Cycle Institute at Catholic University in Washington, D.C.",
        "And the military has not responded.",
        "And that has created the suspicion amongst many people and the media that Musharraf is quietly allowing the fundamentalists to do the worst they can so that he can then red flag the international community and the Americans and say, you know after me, the deluge."

        "But I think the truth is very far from that.",
        "I think what people want is a free and fair election, which would throw up a genuinely empowered civilian government, which then certainly seek a partnership with the military.",
        "Because clearly, there's no way you can rule or govern Pakistan without some kind of support from the military, and you would need the military also in the war on terror.",
        "All this would neither erect a grand reconciliation between the army and the politicians and the protesters.",
        "And the point is that Musharraf is not showing any signs of wanting to attempt this reconciliation.",
        "He wants to go down his own way.",
        "And he's just - in the last 48 hours, he gave an interview to an Arab TV station saying, I will stand for elections in my uniform.",

        "Well, it's the most - one of the most commonly said things to me in the last week that I've been in Lahore, is that Musharraf is presenting himself to the outside world as someone who is a bulwark against Islamic extremism.",
        "But Pakistanis that I've been talking to say, he isn't, in fact - that, in fact, in many ways, he's encouraged Islamist extremism for the very reasons that Ahmed Rashid has just outlined.",
        "That he hasn't tackled the rise of Talibanization in the northwest frontier province, for instance.",
        "And there's another interesting phenomenon happening here.",
        "And that is that when you talk to cosmopolitan, basically, to put it in rather clumsy terms, sort of Western-leaning, educated Pakistanis who have, you know, a strong desire for democracy, they will argue now that by supporting Musharraf, the U.S.",
        "is leading them to become anti-American in their attitude.",
        "In other words, that they're not disposed naturally to be anti-American; although, many of them will have deep reservations about the war in Iraq and perhaps, also the handling of the Afghanistan situation and Israel-Palestine and so on.",
        "But that this insistence in supporting Musharraf and that in their minds, standing in the way of their aspirations to introduce democracy to Pakistan, is in them, not a natural anti-American constituency, creating anti-American feelings.",
        "Philip Reeves, our correspondent is with us today from Lahore in Pakistan.",

        "And, Mary Louise Kelly, let's get back to the question of the fight against the Taliban and al-Qaida, which is we say why we suspected to have reestablished training bases and operational bases in the western parts of Pakistan, at that tribal area.",
        "First of all, the government can't do anything about this?",
        "Well, this is the question, of course, here.",
        "There is a lot of skepticism, for example, building on Capitol Hill, in Congress - the democratically controlled Congress here in Washington - about whether Pakistan is in fact, doing everything that it could do.",
        "And there has been a move to consider linking some of the extraordinary amount of U.S.",
        "aid to Pakistan to better performance on the counterterrorism front, and also to some democratic reforms.",
        "But basically saying, we have given more than $10 billion in aid, and that's just the official number.",
        "There's more flowing through covert channels, which may well bump up the overall figure, and that the U.S.",
        "is not getting as much back as it would like."
