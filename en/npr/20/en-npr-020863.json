        "Yes.",

        "Sure.",

        "True.",

        "I feel like it might be a little too elitist and I think that from what I can tell people are latching onto a lyrical moment, sort of an anthemic quality, but I think you could do something pretty amazing with, you know, Wagner or Bach or Beethoven, but, you know, you can't get the rallying cry of a \"\"Take a Chance on Me,\"\" if you're using classical music.",

        "And, you know, people know that, and it's kind of awkward.",
