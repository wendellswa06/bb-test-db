        "The priorities include curbing funding for so-called sanctuary cities, cracking down on unaccompanied minors from Central America, hiring thousands more immigration enforcement officers and attorneys, limiting family-based legal immigration to spouses and children, not extended family members and, notably, funding and completing the Southern border wall.",
        "Schumer and Pelosi quickly denounced the proposal, writing in a joint statement, quote, \"\"we told the president at our meeting that we were open to reasonable border security measures alongside the DREAM Act, but this list goes so far beyond what is reasonable.\"\" The DREAM Act is the Democrats' preferred DACA fix.",
        "The statement continues, quote, \"\"if the president was serious about protecting the DREAMers, his staff has not made a good-faith effort to do so."
