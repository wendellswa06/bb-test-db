        "Well, Michel, it gets rid of both of those things, along with most of the other major components of Obamacare.",
        "There will be no more subsidies to help people buy insurance.",
        "There's going to be no more individual mandate to require people to buy insurance.",
        "And then they're going to take all the money from these programs - from the Medicaid expansion, from the exchanges and those subsidies - and put it in one big pot and distribute it to the states as block grants where they can set up their own health care systems.",
        "So what about the traditional Medicaid program that many people might be familiar with?",
        "It's the states and the federal government, both contribute to take care of people who are usually, you know, low income, the disabled, seniors and others.",
        "What happens to that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's a - there's a huge restructuring plan in that program.",
        "And that's a huge program, like you said.",
        "It covers tens of millions of people.",
        "Right now, Medicaid pays for whatever care the people in the program need and the federal and state governments split the cost.",
        "There's no limit, and that's exactly what worries Republicans.",
        "It's growing to be a bigger part of our federal budget.",
        "This bill would instead put a cap on that spending.",
        "The federal government would give each state a set amount of money per person in the Medicaid rolls, and that means less money over time for the program, less money for people's care.",
        "And what about this big question of pre-existing conditions, whether those would be covered or not?",
        "Remember, there have been a lot of - I don't know how to put this - kind of arguments...",
        "There's a lot of back forth (laughter).",
        "A lot of back and forth over this.",

        "What's the answer?",
        "Well, it's complicated.",
        "There's definitely language in the bill that says, yes, we will cover pre-existing conditions, but it's pretty vague language.",
        "And most experts say it doesn't offer the strong protections that are now in place under Obamacare, what people think of as their protections.",
        "It allows - this bill allows states, and even encourages them, to ask for waivers that get out of those rules.",
        "So if you're in a state that gets one of those waivers, an insurance company could charge you more if you have a pre-existing condition and could make your insurance out of reach.",
        "Or they could eliminate certain kinds of coverage from their policies like, say, mental health care, which is a problem.",
        "If you're the person with depression, you can get a plan, but it might not cover the care you need.",

        "Do you think that this would meet Senator McCain's call for what's called regular order?",
        "I don't think it would.",
        "It does not change the fact that this is being done on a tight deadline with little time to analyze something that would fundamentally reshape huge chunks of the American economy.",
        "McCain wants a bipartisan process, something that begins at the committee level, something that's collaborative.",
        "And, frankly, that's not the way the repeal effort has gone since the beginning this year.",
        "I think people who follow the earlier debate remember that it was painful for Republicans in the Senate and for the president when the last bill failed in the middle of the night in July.",
        "If they aren't sure that they have the votes, is the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, going to bring it up on the floor?",
        "I think there's a good chance that he still does because you have to remember that Republicans are under tremendous pressure from their core base of supporters to repeal Obamacare.",
        "And you have this situation where basically every major health care and insurance advocacy group is opposing this bill.",
        "But the feeling all along this year from Republicans on Capitol Hill is that they have to repeal Obamacare because they've spent years talking about it, campaigning on it.",
        "Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley was very blunt about that in a call this week with reporters.",
        "Here's what he said.",
        "I could have - maybe give you 10 reasons why this bill shouldn't be considered, but Republicans campaigned on this so often that we have - you have a responsibility to carry out what you said in a campaign.",
        "That's pretty much as much of a reason as the substance of the bill.",
        "So there you go.",
        "And the thinking is that a vote that fails could show donors and base voters, hey, we're really trying here.",
        "Is that as much of a reason as the substance of the bill?",
        "Do other members of the caucus share that point of view?",
        "You've got about 30 seconds, Scott."
