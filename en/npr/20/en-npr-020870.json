        "David L.",
        "Ulin, former book critic for the Los Angeles Times, says the Rawlins novels are fine mysteries but Mosley goes beyond the genre.",
        "I think he's operating in the tradition of writers like Balzac or Dickens who wrote sort of broad social novels with large casts of characters moving across a variety of classes and social spheres and also in which the city, Paris or London or in Walter's case Los Angeles, becomes a character in its own right.",
        "In the Easy novels, the city is important.",
        "The people, even more so.",
        "Mosley said he had a very specific objective.",
        "He wanted to write about the lives he saw around him growing up in LA.",
        "It was part passion, part mission.",
        "One of the things that I understood is that you don't exist unless you're in the literature, and that doesn't include history books.",

        "They - nobody was telling their stories.",
        "Fortunately, there were stories aplenty.",
        "As a boy, Mosley listened to his father and his father's friends talk over backyard beers about politics, music and finessing the city's notoriously racist police.",
        "Those stories helped shape the Easy novels and enabled Mosley to paint a vivid portrait of LA's evolving black community.",
        "Critic David Ulin says the book spanned a critical period in LA's evolution.",
        "Many, many things changed from '48 to '68 in Los Angeles and particularly in terms of race relations, racial culture, racial divisions, et cetera, which are at the essence of what the Rawlins books are tracing.",
        "The novels move from the pre-civil rights era to the late '60s, when Easy has a steady day job but still occupies much of his time seeking answers for people who can't or won't go to the police.",
        "By \"\"Little Scarlet,\"\" the ninth book, Easy has become a private eye and the Watts riots have reduced his old neighborhood to ash.",
        "But after \"\"Blonde Faith,\"\" the eleventh book, Mosley was stuck.",
        "The novel ended with Easy driving off a Malibu cliff.",
        "Fans were devastated.",
        "Mosley didn't see a way around it.",
        "I had no future for Easy, and so I decided I was going to stop writing him.",
        "I didn't think he was really dead, but I did think I was going to stop writing him.",
        "And he did.",
        "For six years, Easy was just gone.",

        "(APPLAUSE)",
        "As president, my father will change the labor laws that were put in place at a time when women were not a significant portion of the workforce.",
        "And he will focus on making quality childcare affordable and accessible for all.",
        "Scott Detrow, she's playing on themes that President Obama could say, in fact, has said - talked about discrepancies between men and women and what they get paid, talking about childcare and that sort of thing.",
        "Absolutely, and this was the moment where all the heads in the press row that I was at snapped up because these are things that are central planks of Hillary Clinton's campaign and something that President Obama's really pushed for.",
        "And this was basically the first time we've heard that from the Trump campaign.",
        "So it's going to be very interesting to see whether this is something that Donald Trump returns to or whether it ends up in any ads.",

        "Does Donald Trump support these things?",
        "I looked around, and I haven't seen any details in any speeches that Trump has given - he might have at one point or another, but again, this has not been a recurring theme of the Trump campaign up until this point.",
        "Let me ask about another speech that we heard last night.",
        "Peter Thiel, he's a venture capitalist, Silicon Valley - he made a statement that is a little bit surprising to hear at a Republican convention.",
        "He said, quote, \"\"I am proud to be gay.\"\" He went on to say, I'm proud to be a Republican and, most of all, proud to be an American.",

        "It almost always coincides with a plethora of other health problems: high blood pressure, low overall life expectancy, diabetes, to name a few.",
