        "The city of Milwaukee, as the Journal Sentinel has been pounding out these stories all year long, has taken strides and begun to take some responsibility on this issue.",

        "And, as NPR's David Welna reports, only lawmakers can stop it.",
        "Defense Secretary Robert Gates went to Capitol Hill last month to make the case for boosting the fees TriCare Prime beneficiaries have to pay.",
        "Something had to be done about the Pentagon's annual health care costs, he argued, noting they more than doubled over the past decade to 52 and a half billion dollars.",
        "Gates said the annual fee for TriCare Prime family coverage should be raised to $520; a hike of $5 more a month.",
        "I understand that any change to these kinds of benefits prompts vigorous political opposition.",
        "Let us be clear, the current TriCare arrangement, one in which fees have not increased for 15 years, is simply unsustainable.",
        "In recent years, Congress has rejected Pentagon requests for far heftier hikes in TriCare premiums.",
        "But Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin says he's not ruling out what Gates wants this time."

        "The blame for the dramatic rise in military health care costs is the war, not the retiree.",
        "That was Rick Jones of the National Association for Uniformed Services.",
        "He called the proposed fee increase a Trojan horse, meant to carry an index fee hike every year for veterans.",
        "The simple fact is that these men and women earned a retirement benefit and they actually look forward to using it.",
        "It's a breach of moral contract to stunt that promise that's been made to these folks.",
        "And Steve Strobridge, of the Military Officers Association of America, said while the premiums for TriCare are relatively low - federal employees generally pay about 10 times as much - that health care is in fact a form of delayed payment for military service.",
        "We think it's very important to have some statement in law, where there is none now, that states explicitly that military health care is one of the crucial offsets to the Everest conditions of service, that is - in fact, an upfront and very substantial premium payment."
