        "Mr. D'Antonio, thanks very much for being with us.",
        "Professor WILLIAM D'ANTONIO (Fellow, Life Cycle Institute, Catholic University): Glad to be here.",
        "And does the separation of church and state - a phrase I believe that does not appear in the Constitution - mean a separation of religion and politics?",
        "Prof.",
        "D'ANTONIO: Well, it can't possibly mean that in a sense that religion has no legal or logical input into politics.",
        "From the very beginning, from Washington through Jefferson down to the present president, religion has obviously had a place in politics.",
        "The question is what kind of a place and to what extent might religion drive the political machinery of our government.",
        "I think that's the question that we study.",
        "And has this ebbed and flowed over the decades?",
        "Prof.",
        "D'ANTONIO: It has certainly been flowed over the decades.",
        "In 1972, for example, when President - and now our deceased President Gerald Ford was in his last session as minority leader, only 34 percent of roll-call votes in the House could be tallied on the basis of political-party loyalty.",
        "The rest were a variety of issues: region of the country, perhaps religious beliefs, a whole variety of other issues.",
        "But by 1996, 85 to 90 percent of all roll-call votes in the House were controlled by party loyalty, and it seems to me that when they look closely at these issues, you'll see that party loyalty trumps religion in a direct sense.",
        "I could explain that if you wanted, more.",
        "Yeah, sure."

        "Prof.",
        "D'ANTONIO: Well, I've looked - a colleague of mine at George Washington, Steve Tukai(ph), have been looking at abortion as perhaps an exemplar of the polarization which seems to have hit our Congress over the last 25 years.",
        "And what we've noticed is that mainline protestants whose theologies -Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Congregational and so on - all of their theologies permit a woman's right to abortion under a variety of circumstances.",
        "Well, mainline Protestants who are Democrats have increased their pro-choice vote from 1980 through 2003, the last year we looked at, from like 55 or 60 percent to 75, 80 percent.",
        "At the same time, mainline protestant Republicans, their pro-choice votes are down around zero.",
        "So it isn't whether you're a mainline protestant, it's whether you're a mainline protestant Democrat or Republican.",
        "You can put the Catholic Democrats and Catholic Republicans right over the mainline Protestants.",
        "You get the same line.",
        "Catholics, especially in the Democratic Party, have moved from less than 50 percent pro-choice to 67, 70 percent.",
        "There are a significant third of Catholic Democrats in the House who do vote a pro-life bill all the time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, let me - and, of course, to use Lincoln's wonderful phrase, each invokes the same God when they cast votes on different sides of the issue.",
        "Prof.",
        "D'ANTONIO: Absolutely.",
        "Perhaps nothing better shows that than John Boehner of Ohio, now the minority leader, who is a devout Catholic and who uses his family background as he talks about how faith has given him his insights into the abortion issue.",
        "He is totally opposed to abortion.",
        "On the other side, you have Rosa DeLauro from Connecticut who says that, again, her family, a Catholic family or a Catholic education, has given her insights and is the grounding on which she bases her political judgments.",
        "But she ends up voting pro-choice - both of them using their conscience to explain their vote.",
        "We might point out that the Democrat majority in the House might be substantially smaller if it weren't for Democrats who were elected who, in fact, are opposed to abortion.",
        "Prof. D'ANTONIO: That's correct.",
        "Which was a change that was consciously made by some party leaders who felt that they ought to be more inclusive of that point of view, certainly if they hope to capture a majority of the members of the House of Representatives."

        "Prof.",
        "D'ANTONIO: Well, we're looking at this Congress with great interest because we have reached a point of polarization not only on abortion.",
        "Abortion is merely an exemplar.",
        "But we've been starting to look at how abortion may influence voting on other issues, and it certainly is clear that when party loyalty trumps religion and then abortion and, say, same-sex marriage or homosexuality as a - homosexual behavior as a sin - are key issues, they may carry a lot of other issues with them.",
        "And so we're looking to see to what extent, in fact, the Democrats may decide to reach across and really involve the Republicans in the legislative process.",
        "It's interesting that when Gerald Ford was the minority leader, John Brademas was one of the rising stars in the Democratic Party.",
        "And he gave a talk to social scientists at that time in which he argued that the role of the House was to debate controversial issues until they could reach an equitable compromise across party lines.",
        "And that certainly hasn't been happening in the last 14 years.",
        "In fact, it wasn't happening in the last years of Democratic control of the House.",

        "Prof.",
        "D'ANTONIO: Yes.",
        "In fact, if I look very closely and in depth at both the House and the Senate and the two parties, it seems to me you can ground the basic ideologies of both parties in religious convictions.",
        "It's no coincidence that the Democrats - with most of the Jews in Congress and Democratic Party - have a basis there for a strongly liberal position on use of the government to aid the needy.",
        "I mean, so a deeply rooted Jewish tradition that to whom much is given, much is expected.",
        "And that also seems to me is a grounding for both the Catholic and the mainline Protestant churches.",
        "Mainline Protestant churches introduce what they call the social gospel teachings way back in 1912.",
        "Many of the members in Congress may have moved away from them, but also the same thing can be said of the Catholic social teachings, which go back to the late 19th Century."

        "If you look at issues like minimum wage, it isn't that, say, a Catholic Republican won't deny that that might be important, it's just that they don't see government as the agent, whereas a Catholic Democrat will, in fact, say when there are no other agents, it's a moral duty of government to provide that kind of assistance to the neediest among them.",
        "So both parties are deeply - their ideologies are rooted in religious convictions.",
        "We want to note, by the way, we invite you to join our conversation at 800-989-TALK.",

        "Prof.",
        "D'ANTONIO: Well, I think most of the issues that are likely to come up, and that, therefore, we're going to be interested in are certainly on the screen.",
        "The reason the minimum wage looks like it ought to be possible to reach across the lines and even get the president's support, there is the question about taxes and what will happen to taxes.",
        "And it's known that the Democrats do not want to allow the ending of certain taxes - estate taxes and other taxes that just really principally help the wealthy.",
        "One, it's not on the radar screen that - certainly not right now, but although you see the more progressive members of the Democratic party, groups like MoveOn urging them in what certainly is the deficit and the debt.",
        "I mean, I don't think that most Americans are aware of who lends us the money to pay our bills and what they would think if they realized how much we owe to China, France and Germany.",
        "So that's an issue that's sort of sub rosa.",
        "Are we prepared to really talk seriously about it?",
        "I would like to see abortion really open to serious dialogue rather than the kind of yes or no, you're for it or you're against it, because the American people and the public survey that either Gallup or Pew or Zogby does shows that the majority of American people are sort of in the middle.",
        "They believe that abortion should be legal under at least some conditions.",
        "But the minorities on either side are controlling the way the vote occurs, and so…",
