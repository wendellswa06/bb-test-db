        "How do you explain something like that?",
        "Are these people who know just enough - or think they know just enough about Mormonism to be misinformed, or what's the caution there?",
        "Prof.",
        "D'ANTONIO: Well, I would be surprised if any significant proportion of American adults know very much at all about Mormonism.",
        "What they do know may be influenced by the headlines, say, of the last several months where there've been that highly headlined case of the Mormon bigamy out in the West.",
        "And so it's to the extent of which people's view of Mormon's is that they practice bigamy, they're subverting the law or even with the passive acceptance of leaders would cause not many people to have concerns.",
        "But it's not surprising.",
        "I mean, if you go back and look at the polls on whether they would consider a black person as a candidate for the presidency with the experience of having blacks like Jesse Jackson run for the presidency.",
        "We've seen a great change that was followed by Colin Powell and now Barack Obama.",
        "It seems to me that what we need is the presence of candidates like Romney who have a chance to talk to the public and show the public who they are and watch those figures change.",
        "I believe we can take calls now.",

        "Well, I beg your pardon.",
        "We're still having some technical difficulties.",

        "If you say it's based on faith, you know, exactly what does that mean?",
        "What does the word faith encompass?",
        "Does it mean a particular religious denomination?",
        "Does it mean that we should enjoy the fact that anybody can believe whatever he or she wants, including being an agnostic or a total - or trying to be an atheist.",
        "That's part of the faith system that we enjoy in the United States, and which perhaps is a light to the world as we see other countries having great difficult struggling with the idea that they can accept people of different faiths in their midst and accept them as equals.",
        "Professor, I hope you can explain this to us.",
        "We often think that faith has gotten involved in politics, and even the deliberations of Congress in a way it wasn't, say, 25 or 30 years ago.",
        "At the same time, I've seen people go over the speeches of President Jimmy Carter, President George W.",
        "Bush - both professedly religious men - and find that they actually have made fewer references - direct references - to God, and I believe virtually none to Jesus Christ, than say Abraham Lincoln made.",

        "But you find that Jefferson himself believed that religion could be a positive force in society.",
        "He certainly was not opposed to religion.",
        "He was fearful of the possibility that any single denomination might be privileged, because the experience that he had of Europe's having privileged religious denominations in all of the major countries of Europe made him aware of the dangerous ways in which religion in that situation could dominate the political scene.",
        "And also, that religion itself could be compromised by such a close relationship.",
        "Professor D'Antonio, we - I'm able to see on our screen here that there's a caller named Boyd in Milwaukee wants to know - and I can pass on his question: Would an atheist have a chance to win office?",
        "Prof.",
        "D'ANTONIO: Well, according to the polls, if you tell me that only minority were willing to accept a Mormon, an atheist is below a Mormon.",
        "Right now…",

        "I mean, that just is not acceptable on the conscious screen of Americans - whether or not they actually know an atheist or would find an atheist, totally oppose the idea - seems un-American to so many Americans.",
        "I doubt that any of our Congress members would openly say they were atheists.",
        "How common is it, professor, for a religious assembly to say to a member of Congress who happens to be a member of that assembly: this is a vote that's important to us.",
        "If you want to remain a member of this faith, you have to vote this way.",
        "Prof.",
        "D'ANTONIO: Well, it was the latter part of your phrase that caught me.",
        "The first part - we have on all the major religious denominations have lobbying groups in Washington, and Catholic church actually has lobbying groups in 34 of the states.",
        "The mainline Protestant churches, the Jewish groups, they all have lobbyists.",
        "They go to the hill to lobby for legislation that they believe is important and reflects their beliefs."

        "The second part of that phrase that would deny them membership if they did not vote in a certain way would be the point at which I think you're breaking through the line of separation between church and state.",
        "Certainly, a religious group could do it.",
        "I mean, the Catholic bishop came pretty close when several of them said they would deny Kerry access to the communion rail if he appeared in the diocese, but that was pretty extreme and one would hope that in retrospect they would consider that perhaps that was not a wise action.",

        "Error had no rights back then, but one of the really 20th century pronouncements of the church was the recognition of the freedom of religion of every person and the freedom to believe or not to believe.",

        "One, is suggests the continuing decline of the hegemony of the mainline protestant denominations.",
        "Just 30, 40 years ago, they were a majority of members of both the House and the Senate and in both parties - that is the Presbyterians, Episcopalians and so forth.",
        "They are now about one in five.",
        "It reflects a broader acceptance of candidates.",
        "And perhaps it also reflects that that hegemony is less meaningful, that there is a broader understanding of party principles - or, in some ways.",
        "There may also be simply the fact that right now, we have both parties with rather clear-cut ideologies.",
        "And the important thing is that a person reflect that broad spectrum of beliefs and legislative ideas that is held within each party then that they - he or she is a Muslim or a Hindu or whatever, or a Catholic, you can be.",

        "Does that mean something in American history?",
        "Prof.",
        "D'ANTONIO: Well, that is an extraordinary turn.",
        "Whether or not it simply reflects the continuing, strongly progressive view of Jews that they have a responsibility to reach out to others - you know, they contravened the common belief that once you accumulate some wealth, you are going to become more and more conservative, many of the Jewish members of the Senate, I'm not so sure about the House, are in fact, quite healthy, but they reflect the most liberal voting pattern in the House and Senate.",
        "So that, simply, may be a reflection of the turn towards a more progressive prospective by Americans.",

        "They want to address issues like global warming.",
        "They want to address issues in environmental change, cutting back the pollution and so forth.",

        "I must say, with regard to Jews, only two Jewish senators and one Jew in the Republican House.",
