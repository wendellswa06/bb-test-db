        "If it were to be seriously discussed in our society, would have to encompass ideas that would bring in scientists - medical scientists, as well theologians and philosophers - well, you know, from whether or not one can use the word murder just because it's becoming used to describe what might happen to a newly fertilized egg.",

        "That's quite distinct from what's happening in our society.",
        "And I think what John was saying is that if we're going to take seriously the notion of the Congress trying to reason through these difficult issues, then we have to have really open debates, discussions that recognize and respect the opinions of others being brought to the floor, rather than simply driving through your own position without considering the other.",
        "And abortion is simply one of many issues then that would deserve that amount of attention.",
        "Health care would be another one that does - the public has a quite different approach to health care.",
        "All the polls I've seen suggest that the public is strongly in favor of much more health care for 43 million currently uninsured Americans than they likely did get, unless we are willing to go though a year or two of serious debate and discussion and working towards a consensus.",

        "Well, I think that there are a couple of reasons for that.",
        "I think, first of all, Roxana, as well as those two journalists working with Al Gore's outfit on the West Coast were captured in North Korea, had much higher profiles than these three did.",
        "They had the backings of reasonably powerful news organizations and powerful people who were able to come to their defense and keep pushing relentlessly for their release.",
