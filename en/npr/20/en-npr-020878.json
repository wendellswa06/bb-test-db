        "He would do that in part by imposing a small fee, or tax, on some financial institutions.",
        "He'd use the revenue to pare down student debt and provide free tuition at public colleges.",
        "One big question, though, is how much money we're actually talking about.",

        "Sanders calls his idea a speculation tax, but it would apply to all trades involving stocks, bonds and derivatives.",

        "And today, many countries, including Great Britain, impose one.",

        "Mr. Dexter was a columnist for the Philadelphia Daily News and Sacramento Bee during a time when many big cities had a signature columnist who wrote about the kind of people and events that were often overshadowed by headlines, leads and breaking news.",
