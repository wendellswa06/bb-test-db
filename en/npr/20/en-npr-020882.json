        "(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)",
        "This video from 1999 shows the public execution of a burqa-clad prisoner who was shot repeatedly in the back of her head.",
        "Such images haunt Nargis Azaryun, who was living in Kabul at the time.",
        "Now 22, Azaryun says she thinks of the people who died here whenever she enters the stadium.",
        "This was a scary place.",
        "And people weren't very happy about this place.",
        "And now, everybody comes here with joy.",
        "The raven-haired college student is one of a dozen budding women mountain climbers who train here almost daily.",
        "It's an odd sight in this conservative country, where Azaryun already rattles norms by driving and refusing to wear a headscarf.",

        "On a recent afternoon, a male coach helps Azaryun and her teammates tie a frayed climbing rope to a billboard of President Ashraf Ghani that overlooks the stadium.",
        "Then they repel down the stadium walls.",
        "They look hesitant but improve with practice, which is something Marina LeGree wants them to do more of.",
        "She's 36 and started a Norfolk, Va.-based nonprofit organization called Ascend, which is funding the girls' training and upcoming expedition to the 25,000-foot-high Mt.",
        "Noshaq.",
        "LeGree says she realizes her small project won't upend traditional gender roles.",
        "But she hopes it will create heroines who inspire women here to break barriers.",
        "LeGree says the idea for this project came to her when she heard about Europeans training Afghan men to be mountain climbers.",
        "So it was like, bing (laughter).",
        "Why don't we have a women's team?",
        "She hired the son of an old Afghan colleague and Azaryun to find the candidates and run her program on the ground.",
        "Ascend has struggled to find girls who reflect Afghanistan's diverse ethnic makeup and whose families will allow them to train at the co-ed stadium, let alone travel to another province to climb a mountain.",
        "A breakthrough came when Ascend teamed up with Sediqa Mayar Nooristani.",
        "She's an Afghan college student who learned to climb when she was 14.",
        "Nooristani enlisted four of her cousins and a handful of other girls to become Afghanistan's first official women's mountaineering team, which she heads.",
        "Ascend also recruited a half-dozen members of the women's national Taekwondo team."

        "Their condition highlights another of LeGree's challenges - getting the women proper clothing and gear for the climb.",
        "Take their climbing rope, for example - it's a 9-year-old hand-me-down from the Afghan men's climbing team.",
        "The girls are using it to hang off the stadium walls on a recent afternoon.",
        "LeGree looks at them in alarm.",
        "Yeah, this is not good.",
        "But we're still struggling with how do we account for the things that we bring and keep everything safe because it's expensive?",
        "So anything we bring is going to be highly valued.",
        "And we just need to keep tabs on it.",
        "That's because preventing fraud is difficult in Afghanistan.",
        "Ascend operations manager Faisal Naziry explains.",
        "They think that when an expat is involved in a project, they may have lots of money.",
        "Then the money become their priority instead of focusing on project.",
        "He adds one person with influence over the mountaineering federation asked Naziry to give him half of any funds he was embezzling.",

        "I think that if there were other avenues or outlets or resources that was available, then they would particularly gravitate towards that...",

        "Well, I grew up in the (unintelligible) houses which is - which they tore those projects down and rebuilt it to what is called West Haven Park now, I believe.",
        "So I was born there about - roughly about '79 and so coming up there, I came from a pretty dysfunctional background where most of my uncles and aunts were getting high off heroin, cocaine and some of the - some of my female relatives were prostitutes.",
        "So - and in that environment, most of the other people in the neighborhood were the pimps, drug dealers, dice shooters, ticket scalpers, some type of hustler, some type of, you know, shyster.",
        "So I looked up to those characters and eventually became somewhat of a few of those characters myself - gambling and selling drugs, using marijuana.",
        "So coming from that dysfunction, all of those behaviors are learned.",
        "So a lot of these guys that are carrying out these shootings and acting up on the streets - it comes from a lot of times the uncles, other older males in the neighborhood.",

        "You know, there would be a lot of times when, you know, people would be having hits out on my brothers or things happening to my brothers and just in a lot of ways, it was a way for me to protect them.",

        "So why - what happened with that?",
        "Why did you get shot?",

        "And so that's what changes.",
        "That's where the violence heightens when you talk about drugs and monies and things of a sort.",
        "And so at this particular time, we were in what was called a gang war.",
        "And so guys would come in and try to shoot us and kill us, and we would kind of go back and forth try to shoot them and kill them.",
        "And so one particular night, I was in a home where we were kind engaging in all of this negative activity.",

        "It made it worse because now you've got these kids that are crossing into other territory, and they're forced to confront those things.",
        "And that's why I mentioned that I think in this day and age, it can be even more risky because I've - I even know friends that, you know, that were shot at or that were always being jumped or that were forced to join gangs just because they live somewhere.",
        "And they be like oh, so-and-so come from this block, so we going to mess with him like that, you know, just do random pick-'em-outs, as they say, just because so-and-so comes from that side of the street per se.",
        "You know, and I had one of my best friends in high school who, you know, tried to join a gang, and they beat his jaw in with the gun.",

        "Edwin, what about you?",
        "Why is this happening?",
        "Well, I feel like young people at this stage that we're in in Chicago, I think we have young people who are just kind of hopeless and giving up as it relates to life and doing something productive in their life.",
        "And so, yeah, that's what I think it is.",
        "Young people are just - they're caught up in a culture and a way of life, even saying I can - and that's a part of the reason why we do what we do today, you know, to go out and to mentor, walk with young people and try to get them to dream again, get them to have hope again is because I think that when we were out, you know, there was a certain level of violence and things that happened on in the community."
