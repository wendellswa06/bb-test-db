        "But it's so much worse now.",
        "And so we want to try to go in, and we want to try to clean up what we did because I think that our young people just really don't have the hope.",
        "They can't see themselves outside of that 8 to 12-block radius or they can't see themselves doing well for them and their families outside of committing violent acts.",
        "Before we let each of you go, obviously, the hopeful part of our conversation is that each of you found a way out.",
        "And so I just wanted to ask each of you what is your story about how one can get out?",
        "And by extension, what would fix this?",
        "What would change this so that we're not continuing to have this conversation year after year after year?",
        "Edwin, do you want to start?",
        "I think that it starts by really having a love and a concern for someone other than yourself, to be able to go out and say, you know what?",
        "Let me go in and let me grab one.",
        "I'll just grab it.",
        "It doesn't have to be a whole group of young people, but let me grab one and talk to him.",
        "I think that it starts with love.",
        "It starts with compassion.",
        "It starts with caring for someone other than yourself.",
        "Mario, what about you, Mario Hardiman?",
        "Yes.",
        "I don't have a clear answer for that, but I can say that my experience is with traveling a lot and seeing that the world was bigger than Chicago and understanding that black people weren't doing the same things everywhere I went.",
        "I've been to - last year alone I went to like 10 different cities to experience what the black experience was in different places, and I saw that Chicago - that's small, you know.",
        "Chicago is very small when you look at things outside of that and what's happening outside of it.",
        "I start realizing though through travel that I really wasn't living life because in Chicago, despite - when the people come here and they love the city and they see Navy Pier and they see downtown, they see Lake Shore Drive, that's all beautiful.",
        "But most of us that come from Chicago, we stay within probably a eight to 10-block radius and don't go too much further than that.",
        "So we're pretty much confined because we're scared of the violence.",
        "So people are saying that, you know, there's so many people are afraid especially like white people right now in the city, but black people are more afraid than anybody in the city because we're the ones who are confined to these radiuses and the violence around us.",
        "But I don't know how we could do this, but we need to have, like, maybe a special correlation (ph) that comes from the government and that will aid the black community and stand behind the black community and let the black people lead their own efforts to solve some of these problems because the problem is a lot of people of these social service organizations and a lot of these other institutions - they don't actually understand what's going on there.",
        "Andre, what about you?",
        "Final thought from you.",
        "I think that everyone has to find their hustle.",
        "So for me, you know, I'm a motivational speaker.",
        "And maybe a lot of that comes with the Navy.",
        "I've been to Compton.",
        "I've been to Miami, St. Louis.",
        "I go to a lot of any major city.",
        "And I just go to the different hoods and I - in those urban communities, I try to speak to them from my experiences in Chicago.",
        "And I'm always being able to relate to them.",
        "Compton showed me so much love.",
        "You know, (unintelligible) - so it's really for me is like they - one of the other gentlemen mentioned before, it's, you know, Chicago has our issues, but there are a lot of ties and a lot of parallels in other black, urban communities.",
        "And so really for me what - trying to tie it together - what I'm really trying to say is about find your hustle is, for me, speaking - motivational speaking is my hustle.",
        "That's my way, you know, right now of giving back to the community, but I think that there are multiple ways to tackle if you want to look at Chicago alone, deal with the situation."

        "And I do believe it's not going to take one of us, but it's going to take all of us.",
        "And so I believe that the tide is changing.",

        "As part of our series Summer Science, we've asked NPR science correspondent Joe Palca to explain what clothing is the best for outside activity when temperatures are high.",
        "When you get hot, you sweat.",
        "But it's not enough to just sweat.",
        "To cool off, you need that sweat to evaporate.",
        "It's evaporation that drains the heat from your body.",
        "To help the sweat evaporate, you want air to flow over your skin - as much of your skin as possible.",
        "So according to George Havenith, professor of Environmental Physiology and Ergonomics at Loughborough University in England, the best clothing for people to wear when exercising is none at all.",
        "They would probably want to wear some underwear to, you know, just cover up and, you know, be comfortable in that way.",
        "But in terms of the heat loss, the naked person is best able to lose heat.",
        "That's only if the sun's not shining.",
        "If the sun's out, you need clothing to protect your skin from burning.",
        "So then you have to find a balance with a certain amount of clothing coverage without the clothing actually hampering the sweat evaporation.",
        "But that made me wonder, why wear clothes?",
        "Why not just wear sunscreen?",
        "That's an interesting point.",
        "In theory, yes, but unfortunately sunscreen sometimes affects sweating as well.",
        "So the sunscreen then might reduce the amount of sweat evaporation and sweat production.",
        "So that's where then things, again, could go wrong.",
        "So if you're exercising in the heat, wear as little as possible, especially after the sun goes down.",
        "OK.",
        "So that explains the skimpy outfits worn by Olympic track stars.",
        "But for those of us who don't move that fast, we asked Joe what's to best to wear when we're not exercising, but we're outside when it's hot."

        "In that case, wear loose-fitting clothing.",
        "Even if you don't realize you're sweating, you will have some moisture evaporation already in the heat, and that means you have to take that moisture away, ideally straight away from the skin.",
        "And that's where the loose-fitting clothing comes in, allowing drier air to pass along your skin from outside your clothing and leave the clothing again.",
        "You don't want to wipe the sweat off, you want it to evaporate.",
        "George Havenith says with tight-fitting clothes, the sweat doesn't evaporate as efficiently, so it doesn't cool you down as much.",
        "Then the question comes up, should you wear dark- or light-colored clothing?",
        "Havenith says there are studies that show that if you wear thicker clothing, like say what Bedouins wear in the desert, color doesn't matter.",
        "Yes, the outer layer of the Bedouins' black garments gets hotter than their white ones, but that heat doesn't get transmitted to the skin because of the thick fabric.",
        "If you wear clothes made from thin fabrics, it's a different story.",
        "And there we find clear differences where we find that the black clothing absorbs more heat that will actually end up inside the body.",
        "Havenith says light-colored lightweight fabrics are best.",
        "So going back to what we learned about the best way to cool off when exercising once the sun goes down, the implications are clear.",
        "People should wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothes in the summertime during the day, and everybody should get naked at night.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Yeah.",
        "I'll leave that to you to be said.",
