        "Bounds is currently one of about 38,000 miners and dependents receiving black lung benefits, compensation for the physical damage he sustained while doing his job.",
        "It took him four and a half years to get approved, despite the fact that his lungs are so bad, he has to stop moving to talk.",
        "Debbie Wills is black lung program coordinator for Valley Health primary care system.",
        "She says that prior to the Affordable Care Act, it was almost impossible to qualify for the compensation benefits.",
        "Coal companies pay the benefits and also pay into a federal trust fund that pays when coal companies can't.",
        "Coal company lawyers would doctor shop around the country and find two, three, four, five, seven doctors to say, yes, this miner is disabled, but it's not because of black lung.",
        "Now it's a little bit easier, and the process often goes more quickly.",
        "That's because the Affordable Care Act includes something called the Byrd Amendments.",
        "One part shifted the burden of proof.",
        "Wills explains that instead of miners having to prove that mining caused their black lung, the coal companies have to prove that mining didn't.",
        "Once we had the Byrd Amendments, you still have to prove that 100 percent disability which is hard to prove, but if you can prove that and you've worked 15 years or longer in the mines, then you're entitled to a presumption that your disease arose from your coal mine employment.",
        "Another part provides lifetime benefits to certain eligible dependents who survive the death of a miner if the miner had been receiving the benefits before their death.",
        "If the ACA is repealed without a replacement, cases that were approved after the ACA went into effect could be reopened, leaving the miner or surviver vulnerable to losing the benefits.",
        "And burden of proof may shift again making it difficult for applicants to qualify.",
        "Earlier this month, both the House and the Senate introduced resolutions to preserve the Byrd Amendments from a broader ACA repeal.",
        "Republican West Virginia Representative Evan Jenkins, an ACA opponent, introduced the measure in the House.",
        "I am a firm believer that Obamacare is already in a death spiral and desperately needs to be fixed.",
        "So while we are going to work to improve our health care system, I feel strongly about my resolution to make sure that the presumption relating to black lung is contained in whatever is the end product of this year.",
        "But that end product is still a pretty big question at this point.",

        "And I'm afraid we're going to have to go to a break in just a few - a minute or so, but I thought we could at least get started here with a question for you, Dr. DiFonzo.",
        "What is the difference between, let's say, rumor and gossip or rumor and urban legend?",
        "Well, rumor is unverified information and circulation among a group of people who are usually trying to make sense of an unclear situation or circumstance or they're trying to manage a threat or a potential threat.",
        "So the classic example of a rumor would be, hey, I heard that NPR was downsizing, Joe.",
