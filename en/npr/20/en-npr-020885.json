        "The maximum impairment you get to when you let people get as stoned as they want to be is about the same as the impairment at .08 of alcohol - so just the drunk-driving limit.",
        "That's not entirely reassuring.",
        "But it suggests marijuana isn't nearly as dangerous as alcohol.",
        "But here's an important point: Kleiman says marijuana users are driving-impaired for hours after they think their high has worn off.",

        "We're about a mile and a half from Midway Airport and occasionally, you can hear airplanes fly overhead.",
        "But otherwise, this is a pretty quiet neighborhood, and authorities say that's exactly how the cartels like it.",
        "The house I'm standing in front of is a pretty cute, quaint, two-story building with a wooden porch and aluminum siding.",
        "It doesn't stand out in any way from the house to its left or its right, and it fits in with the neighborhood.",
        "But last fall, the Chicago police raided this house and allegedly seized about $10 million worth of heroin.",
        "My guests are Duncan Watts.",
        "He's a professor of sociology at Columbia University at New York, and Nicholas DiFonzo, professor of psychology at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York.",

        "Our number is 800-989-8255.",
        "That's 800-989-TALK.",
        "And the rumor that we're changing that number is completely untrue.",
        "It will be the correct number for the entire hour.",
        "And just before we left on a break we were talking with Dr. DiFonzo about the difference between rumor and gossip.",
        "And rumor is something that may be threatening that you may or may not want to do something about, but gossip is a little different, and maybe you could finish that explanation.",
        "Sure.",
        "Gossip is all about social chat.",
        "When I share gossip with you, you're my friend.",
        "I feel closer to you and you feel closer to me, so there's a bonding function that goes on.",
        "And I could also be talking about things that the group ought to be doing or ought not to be doing.",
        "So if I talk about Duncan's escapades at the party last Friday night, I could be criticizing him for doing that, and by the same token, talking about what people should not be doing at the party, or if I'm lauding him, what they should be doing at such occasions.",
        "So gossip is very social in nature.",
        "It's all about the personal social networks that one finds one a part of."

        "Urban legend is a narrative story.",
        "It has a plot, a setting, a climax, usually a denouement, and almost always a moral to the story.",
        "So they're usually intricate stories about modern themes such as hitchhikers and automobiles - those sorts of things.",
        "They're entertaining.",
        "There's some bonding that goes on as well, but they usually make sense of the world in a broader context.",
        "That is, they help us figure out the world and they have a moral to them much like the old fables did.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Let me turn to you, Duncan Watts, and ask the question - it's always struck me that it sometimes feels that there's one person somewhere in the world who's generating all these things, and if you could just figure out who that person was and tell them to stop, it wouldn't happen anymore.",
        "But I guess it couldn't be that way.",
        "But is it ever possible to say that rumor started with him or her?",
        "In any particular instance, it's obviously, you know - everything starts somewhere.",
        "You know, if you make the analogy with epidemics of infectious disease, you know, even sort of global pandemics like the 1919 Spanish flu, you know, almost certainly started with a single person somewhere, probably, you know, in Southern China.",
        "And the same thing is going to be true of rumors, whether they spread just very narrowly within a single group or spread very widely.",
        "The point to make, though, is that there needn't be anything particularly special about the person who starts the rumor, and so this is sort of a bit counterintuitive, because when something special happens - you know, when some, you know, amazing rumor starts sort of sweeping across a city or a country or even throughout an organization, you might think that the person who began it had to be special as well.",
        "But that actually turns out not to be the case necessarily.",
        "You know, it has - you know, whether - why some things spread and other things don't, you know, is partly, you know, due to the kind of psychological affects that Nicholas is talking about.",
        "You know, some things just so to satisfy our emotional needs than others, and that's certainly relevant.",
        "But there's also a structural side to the problem as well, and this is sort of more where the social networks become relevant, is that people are not, you know, uniformly spread across, you know, geography or through cities or through organizations.",
        "They are clumped together.",
        "They are connected non-randomly in all sorts of sort of complicated and overlapping networks, and the structure of the groups and the organizations and the way that they're connected to each other can have, you know, enormous impact on what spreads and what doesn't, and that's really not something that you can pin on any particular individual.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, let's invite our listeners to join in this conversation.",
        "Our number is 800-989-8255.",

        "This is a great program.",
        "I'd like to propose that social - that viral marketing is sort of a reinvention of the rumor for profitable purposes, specifically in the online world, but I'd like to hear your guests' comments on it.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, Dr. DiFonzo, are you familiar with the concept of viral marketing, first of all?",
        "Sure, viral marketing.",
        "It uses the epidemic kind of metaphor or analogy that a rumor spreads by word of mouth through these different networks that Duncan and others are studying.",
        "And it's cheap.",
        "I don't have to pay for airtime in order for things to spread far and wide, and it's often very effective.",
        "Who's the best person to persuade me but somebody that I know, somebody in my personal social network, that Product A or Product B is good?"

        "You know, you can - you can start with some sort of online campaign and you can try to get people talking about some mysterious video or some sort of funny website and give them tools so that they can easily forward URLs or e-mails to their friends, for example, and that's how, you know, some of these viral campaigns get seeded.",
        "Other times you can, you know, you can hand out free merchandise at parties or at bars or, you know, leave them with random people in their mailboxes.",
        "The problem is that nobody knows yet how to sort of engineer - to make use of these - these, you know - clearly in some sense these word-of-mouth ties are very useful and people trust them and pay attention to them in ways that they don't pay attention to traditional media.",

        "I'm working for an Internet company and we've got layoffs pending, and the only source of information that we really have is rumors, and they tend to be a lot more reliable than official channels, and I'm just wondering if you had any comments on rumors - you know, the growth of rumors when either official channels aren't reliable or there just isn't much information.",
        "Yeah, Dr. DiFonzo, what about that?",
        "Do rumors ever - you know, I mean, is there usually a grain of truth somewhere, or is that not always the case?",
        "Marcus is in a very common situation, in which rumors flourish when there's a lack of formal information.",
        "The best way to get rumors going in an organization is to not saying anything or not say very much or to say contradictory things.",
        "And so it's not surprising that the rumors are spreading very quickly in that organization.",
        "The other thing to say is that the most interesting question to me about rumors is, how do you know that what you know is true?",
        "That is, how do you know that this rumor is either accurate or not accurate?",
        "And it turns out that there's some situations in which they are very accurate, and there's other situation which they're not very accurate.",
        "And looking at a collection of communications studies that were done in the '70s, '80s, where communication researchers went into organizations such as the one Marcus is in and they collected rumors and they calculated the percentage of rumors that were accurate."

        "I don't know if it's an urban legend or a rumor - certainly it's in the political arena - but the biggest rumor that I've heard, or urban legend that I've heard, is that Al Gore claimed to have invented the Internet.",
        "He never said that he invented the Internet, but the more the story got told, the more people believed that it was true or believed that it was fact, and it was never the case.",

        "Well, I guess I am sort of - I guess I don't have the same taxonomy of how things spread.",
        "I tend to sort of, you know, think about these problems from something of a social learning perspective that, you know, basically the world is very complicated and it's impossible for all of us to go out and gather all the information that we need on a daily basis.",
        "And so it makes perfect sense to try and infer information from other people.",
        "So we have some sort sensible heuristics for saying, well, you know, if I hear something once, then that increases the likelihood that I'll believe it.",
        "And if I hear it twice or three times then, you know, that likelihood increases in some possibly sort of non-linear kind of way.",
        "And so, you know, one of the important and possibly the most important property of a rumor is whether you believe it and transmit it the first time you hear it or whether you have to hear it twice.",
        "And just that one step makes an enormous difference in how far things spread and how fast they spread."
