        "DiFonzo, I'm just wondering if there's any way to predict in advance how people try to inject in rumors and then make some sort of calculation about whether they're going to spread or not.",
        "There were several studies some time ago where researchers would go into an organization or they'd go into a group and they would inject a false rumor, usually pretty innocuous.",
        "And then they would wait a few days and then pass out questionnaires to everybody in the organization and say have you heard this rumor and where did you hear it from, and they'd trace it back to the person who spread the rumor.",
        "Now, the Al Gore rumor is - we could kind of classify that also as an urban legend.",
        "There is some overlap sometime.",
        "But I think the interesting thing about that rumor is that - it is that Al Gore said he invented the Internet.",
        "And if you think about it, the motivation for spreading that kind of rumor is to kind of make fun of Al Gore.",
        "So obviously the people who would be most likely to spread that rumor would at least be in part motivated by a negative disposition toward Al Gore and that sort of thing.",
        "Thank you very much.",

        "I don't want to go into great detail.",

        "Maybe he can help us out a little bit here.",
        "So I think there actually is a good reason for that.",
        "And it goes back to this sort of well-known idea of the small world problem that social networks have a certain structure to them such that, you know, everybody is connected in a sense by only a few degrees of separation.",
        "So you know someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows anyone in the world.",
        "And that is, you know, an idea that's been around for a long time.",
        "But I think that recently we've gotten to understand it very well.",
        "And one of the things that we've understood about it is that this small world probably happened quite a long time go.",
        "And so, you know, and once the, and the reason is that you don't require a lot of fancy technology for social networks to develop this kind of property."

        "And the second thing is that once the world gets small, it's much harder to make it smaller, right?",

        "Well, there is some good techniques that one can use if you're in that position where you want to stop the rumor.",
        "First of all, I'd urge you to stop the rumor only if it's not true.",
        "You wouldn't want to deny a rumor or rebut a rumor if in fact it is true.",
        "Don't use the approach no comment, or rather almost never use the approach no comment, because it increases a level of uncertainty: why is this person saying no comment?",
        "One of the best techniques is to rebut the rumor, but to use a third party, a trusted third party to do the rebutting.",
        "And then when you rebut the rumor, to provide a context.",
