        "Let's say my experience making little independent movies came in very handy.",
        "We didn't have a studio when we were making it.",
        "Nobody wanted to make this movie because it's a drama about 33 Latin men.",
        "And that doesn't get made anymore.",
        "It took, you know, a real effort.",
        "And we ended up shooting 35 days, six days a week, 14 hours every day in the mine.",
        "So you really got the sense of how claustrophobic a mine is because you get it in the movie as they go down, down, down.",
        "It seems to never end.",
        "Well, it's, you know, we shot in two real mines in Colombia.",
        "And we went to Colombia because their mines are - they're not as deep and as dangerous as the Chilean mines.",
        "Every single moment we had the head of the mine with us looking after our heads, basically.",
        "So sometimes he would come in and say, everyone step away.",
        "And they would put up a ladder, and they would detach a big rock that was going to fall.",
        "And it would fall.",
        "They would clean it up, and then we would continue shooting.",
        "San Francisco has issued nearly 20,000 ID cards since the program's inceptions.",
        "We're averaging about 4,000 a year.",
        "And what can people who, say, don't have valid visas or green cards, what can they do with a San Francisco city ID card that they couldn't do otherwise?",
        "It's wonderful.",
        "This city ID card improves access to many of our services in the community.",
        "It allows them to access financial institutions so they can now open bank accounts and acquire ATM cards.",
        "It allows them to get library cards, access museums, city parks.",
        "It's been a wonderful way to promote a sense of community and it definitely is good for our public safety.",
        "Now, you know, I read a newspaper story from last year about New Haven, Connecticut's experience with this and they found that after, I think, 10,000 such IDs the number of people that use them for library cards was 50 or 60, a similar number had used them to open bank accounts at the main community bank.",
        "Do you have any sense of how many people have actually used their San Francisco ID cards for the functions you've described?",
        "We haven't collected that demographics.",
        "We just have the demographics on how many people have come and applied for an ID card and how many we've issued.",
        "We just have, anecdotally, we know that many people are Latino.",
        "I've heard from my neighbors that they have got the municipal ID cards so that they can go to the municipal golf courses and get discounts there.",
        "But we don't have the demographics on how many have opened up bank accounts or gone to the libraries.",
        "Your ID card in San Francisco goes one step further than New York City's.",
        "It doesn't identify the gender of the holder.",
        "What was the reasoning behind that?",
        "That's correct.",
        "And that's so our transgender population could access and get an ID card so all we require is a court order saying this is your name."

        "What kind of documentation does San Francisco insist on before issuing a city ID?",

        "…and also the house where my father grew up.",
        "And when I knocked on the door and I talked to the folks in the house, you know, they were understandably suspicious.",
        "They thought that I had come back to scope out the property and because I hoped to one day come back and reclaim it.",
        "And, you know, I assured them that at least in my case that wasn't the - you know, that wasn't my intention.",
