        "Because they feel - there are some Cubans here who feel they're going to go back and take everything that was taken from them.",

        "And we can talk until, you know, until we're blue in the face about which list is longer.",
        "But it seems to me that at this moment in time, when a post-Fidel leadership is going to draw on a new generation of Cubans for its expertise - scholars, scientists, doctors, engineers - we should be reaching out to that generation, you know, instead of engaging in these discussions about how good Cuba is or how horrible it is.",
        "I think, you know, it is what it is.",
