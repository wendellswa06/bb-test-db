        "And I said to him, I said well, he's just as old.",
        "What's going to happen with him?",
        "Because practically everybody that was involved in the revolution, they're dying as well.",
        "And he said that well, we have things in order.",

        "And he said that he doesn't believe that the Miami Cubans have the guts to come in and try to take over.",
        "That they want to come in - they want the United States to come in and do something, but he doesn't believe that they have the guts to come in and try to take over, whatever.",

        "They don't have e-mail or anything like that.",
        "And I said to him, I said well, what's going to happen - do you think you'll ever get e-mail?",

        "He said yes, of course.",
        "He says I know that we're slow, but when we figure out on how to, you know, get it done or whatever - do it so it will benefit them the most.",

        "Not even from someone with the Castro regime."

        "And it's possible that Cuba - after this time of hostility - will be able to grow to a prosperous socialist country.",
        "And although I have my doubts about that myself, I was dismayed that the conversation has not had a balanced approach to the great history of American atrocity against Cubans and also the fact that Castro has not himself been violent against his own people, even though he has compromised his civil liberties in many cases.",
        "Professor Garcia?",
        "I see your points, but I understood the topic of today's session - the attitudes of Cuban-Americans towards the island.",
        "I mean, certainly what you say is correct.",
        "We can point to the islands - I mean to the Cuban states' many successes, certainly in education and in health care.",
        "And perhaps we can dedicate an entire show to that topic.",

        "I agree this is very important.",
