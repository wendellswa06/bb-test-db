        "Sure.",
        "Yeah, one of the comments I think that hasn't really been touched upon is the fact that I think that as a young Cuban-American, I've been in this country since - I was born in this country, I should say - and I'm in my mid-40s.",
        "And what I found is that people of Cuban background - depending on their socio-economic level within our community - have different opinions about how they would like to go back or not go back.",
        "And I find that those that have not been as successful in this country tend to have more of a feeling of wanting to return than those that I think have been let's say more successful or of a higher socio-economic level.",
        "Professor Garcia, we've talked about generational differences.",
        "How much about this is differences in class?",
        "I think the caller's absolutely correct.",
        "I'm often asked who's likely to return to Cuba, you know, assuming that the Cuban state allows Cuban-Americans to return.",
        "And that's a big if.",
        "I think those - the more recent arrivals are probably among the more likely to return - those who feel disaffected, who never quite adapted to U.S.",
        "society for whatever reason, either because they didn't learn the language or, you know, weren't able to earn a livelihood that was to their satisfaction.",
        "There were anti-government demonstrations today in Morocco and news of increasing violence in Libya.",
        "We'll have the latest.",
        "But first, the number of Americans who own their own home is falling.",
        "During the tour, Debosier gets a call on her cell phone from one of the loggers.",
        "The disaffected, I think, would be more likely to return.",
        "What I do see happening - again and this is a big if, assuming that the Cuban state one day allows this to happen - I do see a lot of traveling back and forth across the Florida Straits.",
        "You know, there's a long history, you know, of travel back and forth across the Florida Straits.",
        "Long before Fidel took power, Cubans were living in the United States.",
        "Americans were living in Cuba and traveling, you know, spending part of their lives in each other's country.",
        "And I could see that happening again.",
        "Cuba is very close to the state of Florida, 100 to 110 miles.",
        "I could very easily see a scenario where, you know, Cuban-Americans live in south Florida, hop on a plane and go to Santiago de Cuba or Havana or any of a number of cities and you know, operate a business there and then come back home at the end of the day in much the same way that other Americans commute between Washington, D.C.",
        "and Boston and New York.",
        "You know, we could see a commuter society of sorts.",
        "But again, all of this is dependent on whether the Cuban state allows this to happen.",
        "And given the long history of conflict between exiles and people on the island, it might not be possible.",
        "And that's where I think the new generation steps in on both sides of the Florida Straits.",
        "I think this is where the new generation will be important."

        "Well, the first wave of immigrants that came from Cuba suffered the brunt of the communist revolution.",
        "They lost property.",
        "They had homes and cars and all kinds of private property confiscated, and that's the rancor that they brought with them and what charged them politically.",

        "This newer generation of immigrants was born and raised mostly under the Castro government, and they never went through that shock of losing everything that they worked for.",

        "It's illegal to own property or cars or businesses.",

        "And I wanted to ask you more about this more recent - the differences between the more recent arrivals and the flow of people - I mean, we saw that big bulge during the boat lift - Mariel - but in fact there have been more people coming in the past few years than even arrived back in the ‘80s.",
        "That's right, Neal.",
        "It's been a steady flow of Cuban immigrants coming in to the Miami area and to the United States from Cuba.",
        "Over the last five years or six years alone, we've seen about 130,000 Cuban immigrants arrive.",
        "That is more than arrived during the entire Mariel boatlift.",
        "So it's a steady stream of immigrants, in part fueled by a visa lottery that the United States has which provides 20,000 exit visas to Cubans every year - legally - to come to the United States.",
        "So we are constantly being I guess refreshed or injected with new arrivals from Cuba who bring with them the attitudes of the moment that dominate the island.",
        "And right now the immigrants that are coming here - I did a story a few weeks ago about the new arrivals - and right now what you're seeing is a group of people who are so tired and just sick of politics that they don't want to have anything to do with it.",
        "They don't have to deal with the politics in Cuba, and they don't want to have anything to do with the politics in Miami.",
        "They just want to live their lives.",
