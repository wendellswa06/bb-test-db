        "He was working at a bike seat factory in Berkeley.",
        "And on the weekends, he would take these really long bike rides through the Bay Area.",
        "And on one of those weekends, he and a friend took a bunch of energy bars with them - the ones that were available at the time.",
        "And over the course of the ride, Gary goes through about five of these bars.",
        "And I looked at the sixth one, and I just said, no way.",
        "I can't do one more.",
        "I would rather starve than eat another one of these.",
        "And I turn to my friend, Jay (ph), and I said, you know what?",
        "I can make a better energy bar than that.",
        "Right.",
        "And as you said, Guy, many of us have those moments where we say, I could do this better.",
        "But then we move on and do not do anything about it.",
        "Right, but Gary Erickson was in kind of a unique situation because he was already running a small side business.",
        "He was selling homemade Greek pastries that he learned to bake from his mother.",
        "So anyway, as Gary tells the story, the day after that long bike ride, he calls his mom up and he says, hey, can we try making an energy bar?",
        "And she's like, what's an energy bar?",
        "And I said, it's kind of like that great oatmeal-chocolate-chip-raisin cookie that you make, but we can't use butter, we can't use sugar, and we can't use oil.",
        "She goes, well, that's impossible.",
        "Well, it does actually sound kind of impossible.",
        "Yeah, it does.",
        "But Gary, he can't let this idea go, so he and his mom start to experiment.",
        "They use oats and dried fruit and a sweetener made from rice.",
        "And the bar is actually horrible at first - I mean, just awful.",
        "But after about six months, they hit on a recipe that works.",
        "And Gary starts to sell these bars at bike shops all over the Bay Area.",
        "And he names them Clif, which is after his dad, who was named Clifford.",
        "So for most of us, that's - that's a little bit scary - to see if people will buy this thing that you have, in his case, cooked up, quite literally, with his mom.",
        "Yeah.",

        "He's still working as a manager at that bicycle seat factory, really until the company starts to take off.",
        "Which is interesting, Guy, because you always hear that an entrepreneur has this total commitment, even an obsession with whatever it is that person is building.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But, you know, I would say that that was absolutely true for Gary Erickson as well.",
        "I mean, he was very emotionally involved.",

        "Yes, well, clearly he was very emotionally involved.",
        "Yeah and, as I say, still is.",
        "And not to give too much of the story away, but Clif Bar is still largely owned by Gary and his wife, Kit, and has estimated revenue of around a quarter of a billion dollars a year.",
        "That, of course, is Guy Raz, host of the new podcast HOW I BUILT THIS, all about entrepreneurs like Gary Erickson.",

        "Over the past several months, the Baptist pastor has been arrested and threatened for criticizing President Robert Mugabe's government and encouraging demonstrations against corruption there.",
        "Now he's visiting the United States for a time, but some of his supporters say he's abandoned his cause at a critical moment.",
        "Pastor Mawarire stopped by our NPR studios late last week.",
        "I asked him to explain why his movement seems to be resonating in his country.",
        "I think it has grown very naturally in terms of people wanting a platform where they can really genuinely express how they feel let down by their own country.",
        "Over the last 20 years, it has become obvious that Robert Mugabe and the ruling party, ZANU-PF, are not really interested in letting anyone else build Zimbabwe."

        "We mentioned them by name and put petitions together that they must be fired.",
        "And it crystallized again at the cricket game between Zimbabwe and New Zealand, when Zimbabweans stood up in the 36th over to signify 36 years of repression and silence.",

        "Yes, there is a scene - it's a fantastical scene towards the end when the men are - they're just about lost hope.",
