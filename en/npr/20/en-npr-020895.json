        "On the op-ed page of The New York Times today, the actress Angelina Jolie revealed she recently had a preventive double mastectomy, both breasts removed and then reconstructed.",
        "Her mother died of breast cancer at 56 and Jolie herself had been diagnosed with the inherited BRCA1 gene mutation, which significantly increases the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.",
        "And so, she writes: I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much as I could.",
        "Of course, there are women everywhere who carry the same gene mutation as Angelina Jolie.",
        "But do they have the same sort of access to genetic counseling and medical procedures?",

        "Thank you for having me.",
        "So, first, to be clear, the majority of breast cancers are not caused by a BRCA gene mutation.",
        "But if you do have the mutation, you're much more likely to develop breast or ovarian cancer, is that correct?",
        "That's correct.",
        "About five to seven percent of breast cancer, about 14 to 20 percent of ovarian cancer is due to a gene mutation - so, not the majority.",
        "And people who inherit a BRCA mutation are at very high risk for both cancers and also at somewhat higher risk for other cancers, too.",
        "Now, Angelina Jolie writes in this New York Times op-ed that: Today, it is possible to find out through a blood test whether you are highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer and then take action.",
        "But how easy is it for women to do so?",
        "And, for instance, do most insurance policies cover the steps that she took?"

        "So, there are national guidelines that determine who should and who will get the most benefit from a genetic evaluation.",
        "It's important to us to make sure people know that you should see an expert known as a genetic counselor, or a medical geneticist, in order to find out what your risk is, rather than just going out and getting a blood test.",
        "And if the chance of having a mutation is high enough, based on expert guidelines, most insurances will cover genetic counseling and genetic testing.",
        "But what about that next course of action?",
        "In this case, Angelina Jolie talked about a preventive double mastectomy.",
        "Is that something covered?",
        "What are the out-of-pocket costs involved here?",
        "A lot of it depends - there's a lot of different options for the types of mastectomy and reconstruction.",
        "It's actually - that technology has come a long way, and it depends on people's insurances.",
        "But we have found in the FORCE community, which is thousands of women who have undergone these procedures, most insurances will pay for mastectomy.",
        "And if they pay for mastectomy, they must also pay for reconstruction based on federal law that was passed in 1998.",
        "Now, Angelina Jolie also said that she started with the mastectomies because her risk of breast cancer was higher than her risk of ovarian cancer and that the surgery is more complex.",

        "The president himself personally has threatened me on many occasions in his speeches, and in one of the speeches literally said that there is no place for someone like me in a nation like Zimbabwe.",

        "My lawyer, who was there, also informed me that about a hundred other lawyers had showed up at the court to come and defend me.",
        "And right there is when I started to have a sense that something really amazing was taking place not just for me, but for many Zimbabweans who were now taking the issue of injustice very personally.",
        "Eventually, my lawyer, together with the help of these many lawyers, were able to present a case that it was a violation of my constitutional rights as a citizen and the magistrate had no choice but to release me.",

        "We have not lost that.",
        "The fact of the matter is that the change for Zimbabwe was never going to be housed in one person.",
        "It was always going to be a united front of people, everybody putting their hands on deck in the same way that people did when they came to the court.",
        "They didn't come to the court for me.",
        "They came to the court for Zimbabwe.",
        "But a little bit about what has happened around me during that time that a lot of people don't understand - at about 1 a.m. whilst we were in the cell, a man came to interrogate me and asked me to come into a room with him.",
        "He says, you tell me right now you're sitting in this cell.",
        "If somebody was to show up at your house and rape your wife, how would you defend her?",

        "Your lawyer doesn't even know that you're sitting with me in this room right now.",
        "In fact, if you go back into the cell where you've come from, you could very well get raped yourself there and never be able to prove that it actually happened to you.",
        "And, of course, that was a way of threatening, but it made me think deeply about the fact that we don't have to always put ourselves in mortal danger to bring about the change we want.",
        "I think that there are ways that we can continue to fight and continue to put pressure.",
        "And so I stand by my decision.",
