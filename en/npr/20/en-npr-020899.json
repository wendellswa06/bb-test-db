        "His YouTube channel has multiple videos detailing what led to his violence.",
        "He talks about being lonely and very angry that he still was a virgin at 22.",

        "That UCSB senior Parker Lanting says gun control and mental health must be discussed.",
        "I think the fact he had 400 rounds of ammunition - over 400 rounds of ammunition - is ridiculous.",
        "No one person should own that recreationally.",
        "He was a 22-year-old student who obviously had mental issues.",
        "Somebody should've seen this and somebody should've spotted this pattern.",

        "It's a city that looks like an outsized set for a Hollywood disaster blockbuster.",
        "That's how Los Angeles Times reporter Patrick McDonnell describes the ravaged Old City of Homs in Syria.",
        "It's been under military siege for almost two years.",
        "Last week, some 2,000 Syrian rebels were allowed to leave Homs, under a truce agreement.",
        "Now, the Syrian army is in control and civilians who fled have come back to the Old City in droves to see what they can reclaim of their lives there.",
        "Patrick McDonnell joins me now.",
        "He just spent two days in Homs and he's back in Damascus.",
        "And, Patrick, describe the Old City and the extent of the devastation that you saw there.",
        "Well, it's quite staggering, and one of the challenges really of covering Syria is just describing the extent of the destruction everywhere really, but especially in the Old City of Homs.",
        "At first, it's somewhat reminiscent of these photographs, I think we all remember, of bombed-out cities in World War II: Dresden, Stalingrad, places like that.",
        "When you're inside, it's really a war(ph) of alleys and small streets and you're kind of surrounded by these hollowed-out facades of buildings and piles of debris of all kinds.",
        "At the same time, as you mentioned, all these people are coming back and many of them are just actually thrilled to be there, even though many of them have found their houses were destroyed.",
        "Well, that's the really surreal part of this, isn't it, the civilians who are happy to be back.",
        "What are they finding when they come home and are they expecting to stay in Homs?",
        "There's two answers to that.",
        "People are finding kind of various remnants, mementos of their lives.",
        "Usually not anything of value, but, I mean, I found, you know, women with bags of hair curlers and hair pins.",
        "I found a man who was just hugging a photograph of his late father in military uniform.",
        "People had battered toys and rugs.",
        "And I think a lot of it was just the psychological connection of their former lives that had been shattered.",
        "Now, I think just about everyone who used to live there said they wanted to go back but the scale of the destruction is really so vast that I think it's clear to everyone that wide expanses of the Old City is going to have to be razed and rebuilt.",
        "So, how many of them will be able to go back, I think, is, you know, a major question.",
        "So, for now, they may be coming back to find what few possessions they can and then to leave once more?",
        "Jim Lehr is the moderator, so there will be lots of room for interaction and filibusters.",
        "Of course, both the campaigns are talking up the big stakes up tonight.",
        "But what exactly is each candidate going to be trying to accomplish.",
        "I think we alternated 'cause your arm would get tired.",
        "And we got the bottom cut away, and then it was - David's shoulders were narrow enough that we could put it over his head, and then the opening, the spout end, was just wide enough that we could put a microphone in.",
        "And then he could sing inside of it.",
        "And the two of you were laughing about this the whole time.",
        "Well, the funniest part was, we got done, and it sounded horrible."

        "What does it say about an artist that, when looking for an interesting-sounding backup vocal, he says, I know; let's try sawing the bottom off a plastic water cooler and see how that sounds?",
        "Well, that's just indicative of the bigger picture.",
        "I mean, that was what drew me to David's music when I was 13 years old - just sheer adventure.",
        "His public image was so otherworldly.",
        "When you were in the studio early in the morning or late at night, did he have an otherworldly quality about him, or did he ever just seem, like, slogging away in the studio like any other old guy?",

        "But often, given where most recording studios are, you'd be in New York, and it would be 10 for 10 on the street, you know?",
