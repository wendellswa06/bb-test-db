        "First, on the Syrian side, the United States has given humanitarian support and even some help to the armed opposition but not nearly enough and, certainly, not airstrikes.",

        "Are there enough Democrats who can swallow that, E.J., and enough Republicans who can imagine more increased taxes to add up to even small majorities in Congress?",
        "It sure doesn't look so at the moment.",
        "I think - first of all, I'm very glad a lot of Democrats came out against the president's proposal to change the index for Social Security because, if nothing else, this shows that President Obama has really been willing to put some hard stuff on the table.",
        "He is, you know, the Medicare cuts, the way he structured them, probably won't inspire the same opposition from Democrats.",
        "But Republicans so far have not been willing to give any ground at all.",
        "I do think that if the Republicans ever gave on revenue, there probably would be enough Democratic votes to pass it.",
        "And I agree with the implications of Scott Horsley's story that if anybody can push this along, it's the group of Republican senators the president is going to be meeting with.",
        "I think he's going to be meeting with the same group of Republican senators a lot on absolutely everything from the deficit to guns to immigration.",
        "David, is there some gang out there working on the economy?",
        "There's no shortage of gangs.",
        "I, too, am glad Democrats came out against because it suggests there's something sensible in what Obama has proposed.",

        "They will be willing to tolerate a revenue increase if the president will give them a structural change in Medicare, not just tamping down the reimbursement rates, not just less spending but some structural reform at the foundation.",

        "Well, you don't have to go that far, but combining Medicare A and B.",
