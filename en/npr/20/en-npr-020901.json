        "Nick Lantz's third book is full of figures of temporary home: hotels, hospitals, foreclosed on neighborhoods.",
        "It is also filled with homelessness, transience and a roving media-filled landscape in which it's hard to rest, platforms move, people move on.",
        "And at the heart of this biting but tender book is a dark picture or our recent housing crisis itself.",
        "In the book's central sequence, Lantz writes in the voice of an evicted couple who work as actors in an abandoned housing development.",
        "The couple doesn't live there, but instead, they pose as residents to lure other investors.",
        "Along with a group of out of work actors, they are paid by the hour to play neighbor.",
        "Here our American landscape is depicted darkly.",
        "Lantz writes: From the highway you can see half-built housing developments, the homes abandoned in various states of undress, all huddled around the cloudy mirror of a manmade lake.",
        "Coming soon, says the sign: Hidden Valley, Foxfire Valley, Valley of Sorrows.",
        "This is an eerie land of wild geese, stage-set supervisors, and rows of disinhabited structures.",
        "In this dystopia, Lantz has a knack for turning the battered material of daily life into something off-kilter, newly felt.",
        "Lantz's poem \"\"Re: 5 Ways to Enhance Your Love More Passionate,\"\" cuts up loan shark and pharmaceutical ad messages into a wry, sad testament of our desire to be loved, to be home.",
        "Other poems pose as how-to manuals: how to help a ghost, how to appreciate inorganic matter.",
        "In these strange guises, once familiar language becomes odd.",
        "Dislocation freshens it.",
        "Even the rote hotel phrase: How many nights will you be staying with us, grows vaguely metaphysical.",
        "Indeed, how many nights are any of us staying?",
        "Why are we here now?",
        "Lantz shows us moving through a world that spins out of our control.",
        "But amid the remnants these poems are testaments to what remains of our hope.",
        "I'm telling lies about you, because all I'm left with is this sentence that I love, writes Lantz.",
        "In this language, and just beyond it, poems are made whole not by what's present but by desire, the urgent human wish to belong.",

        "Using lumber found in dumpsters, donated building supplies and some of her own funds, a 29-year-old woman named Constance Hockaday has transformed five abandoned vessels into a boat hotel that includes a floating platform with a movie screen on it.",
        "Hockaday actually makes no secret of the fact that she's inspired by a 19th Century madam who presided over a floating bordello in Oregon.",
        "I did throw around the idea of creating a floating brothel, but I don't know if I'm quite madam material.",
        "Hockaday decided to create a floating hotel instead and she found a willing collaborator in Ari Zablozki.",
        "The owner of Marina 59 gave her an old houseboat and the hulls of four fiberglass motor boats that had been abandoned by their owners.",
        "People abandon their boasts very quickly.",

        "Oh, I think many people are making that case, and other people are making a case that the Islamic state itself, operating in Syria with huge amounts of freedom of maneuver and generating money, constitutes a threat to our friends in the region and ultimately to the United States.",
        "And so I think there is absolutely both a humanitarian as well as a national security threat that gives a new context in which to consider American airstrikes in Syria.",
        "But at this time, it seems like the administration is not considering airstrikes in Syria.",
        "And so if not that, what can they do?",
        "Well, the one group in Syria that is really fighting this awful Islamic state are moderate armed groups who have become sick of the Islamic State's depredation and are fighting them actively - fighting them right now.",
        "Some of us were in a phone call with one of their commanders last week, and he said they are in serious need of ammunition as they fight the Islamic State in northern Syria."

        "And, you know, the regime of Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, in recent days, has been launching its own airstrikes against Islamic State.",

        "First, historically - going back 10 years ago - the Assad regime was helping the Islamic state or its predecessor organization inside Iraq to kill American soldiers.",
        "Second, the Assad regime, just until the last two months or so, did nothing to fight the Islamic state.",

        "They would let convoys of the Islamic State's fighters through its line.",

        "And there are all these rumors going around the market saying that she was gang raped, and she leapt to escape her attackers.",
        "I mean, I think the real crux of the issue is that this huge mistrust in the police, people believe they're covering something up, and there were really no outlets to express discontent, apart from going out to the protest.",
        "So we're seeing these really extraordinary measures to intimidate potential protesters.",
        "And today, I spent the morning in that market, and there were police every few yards, and we passed 20 buses, each of them carrying 50 policemen, just sitting there in case trouble might break out.",

        "No one dared protest.",

        "Is the growing use of social media one reason we're seeing these larger incidents?",
        "Well, it's certainly the way that the word gets out.",
        "You know, people hear what's happening, and often, they go to see with their own eyes, and then the crowds grow.",

        "He has to use this debate to close the sale.",
        "There aren't a lot of undecided voters out there, but there are enough of them to make a difference in a close race.",
        "In the poll that NPR just completed, 82 percent of likely voters said they'd watch tonight, 25 percent of them said the debate could help them determine who to vote for.",
        "And Mara, there are polls showing President Obama with a small lead in most battleground states and at the same time, for Mitt Romney, a lot of the stories out there have been focused on criticism of the GOP convention and then this now infamous video of him talking about 47 percent of Americans.",
        "Can tonight's debate really help turn the tide for Mitt Romney?",
        "Well, it can and it has to because he doesn't have a lot of game changing opportunities left.",
        "I think the most amazing thing is how stable the race has been.",
        "Despite the problems you just listed, Romney's support hasn't collapsed.",
        "The president has a small lead, yes, although some polls show the race tightening a bit nationally and in key states like Virginia and Florida, but it stayed very stable.",
        "And the Romney campaign, after a period of grabbing anything they could, a headline, a gaffe or an old video to pummel the president now appears to be trying to put some more policy specifics forward.",
