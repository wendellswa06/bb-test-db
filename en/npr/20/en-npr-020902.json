        "And Mara, looking back, I mean, have debates in the past really changed the outcomes of elections?",
        "Well, it's hard to find an example since the Kennedy/Nixon debates where that has happened.",
        "They can make a difference and not just the real time debates themselves, but how they're analyzed later and the next day by pundits and late night comedians.",
        "The race is so close and so polarized, neither candidate has been able to break away, so little things really do matter.",

        "And this morning we're going to ask where the Tea Party money comes from.",
        "We met with Dave Levinthal of OpenSecrets Blog at the Center for Responsive Politics.",
        "Is the Tea Party movement a grassroots movement or not?",
        "On one end, it very much is a grassroots movement.",
        "It's a movement that surely sprung up out of the ether in a lot of people's minds.",
        "But then on the other hand, you have sort of an establishment that is somewhat preexisting.",
        "And these are the folks who have come to the game with a great deal of money, if not a great deal of energy, which certainly you associate with the grassroots end of this movement.",
        "So you have two things going on at once here, is what you're saying.",
        "There really is angst out there.",
        "There really are people who are concerned about the direction of the country, but there is also this political structure and corporate structure that's driving them a little bit.",
        "Certainly.",
        "But arguably, there are some groups out there who have co-opted this energy.",
        "One would be the Tea Party Express.",
        "It's an organization that has largely been criticized by even some of the more grassroots Tea Party organizations as being run by political operatives, run by Republicans and..."

        "And where do they get their money?",
        "Well, they get their money from a variety of sources, from a lot of individuals, some institutional support.",
        "But they have received a ton of it, in fact, just their political action committee alone, the Our Country Deserves Better PAC has raised more than $5 million during this current election cycle.",
        "There's another group called Americans for Prosperity.",
        "What is that?",
        "Americans for Prosperity is an organization that has spent millions of dollars in various forms during this year, and it's a group that has a lot of power, a lot of influence.",
        "And it's similar to a number of organizations that have just cropped up in the aftermath of the Citizens United versus Federal Election Commission decision, which is a Supreme Court decision that has effectively said that it is now legal for corporations, trade unions, other types of groups to directly advocate for or against a particular political candidate, and do so by raising unlimited sums of money.",

        "The practice was once called talking a bill to death and some of the classic filibusters went on for months.",
        "More recently, the filibuster has functioned more as a very effective threat.",
        "Those threats have proliferated to the point that they largely govern the flow of bills and nominations through the Senate.",

        "Well, Melissa, a filibuster occurs when a senator uses his or her right to object to moving ahead with a bill or nomination, insisting that more debate is needed.",
        "And it takes the votes of at least 60 senators to overcome such an objection, and dozens of hours have to transpire as well, both before and after such a vote, even if that vote succeeds in breaking the filibuster.",

        "The Senate really is making some changes that will diminish the power to filibuster in some circumstances, but by no means are senators getting rid of the filibuster altogether.",
        "I doubt that the Republicans in the minority would have agreed even to these relatively small changes, since they are the minority and the filibuster is the minority's most potent weapon.",
        "But Majority Leader Harry Reid said yesterday that if he and Republican leader Mitch McConnell could not agree on some changes to the filibuster, Democrats would sidestep the rule requiring a two-thirds majority to change the rules and make those changes with a simple 51-vote majority.",
        "And apparently Reid had the votes to do that.",
        "Well, do the changes, David, really mean that more bills will eventually get to the floor, where they can be debated?",
        "I think so.",
        "Republicans have used filibusters, or the threat to filibuster, hundreds of times in recent years to keep legislation and nominations from even reaching the Senate floor.",
        "And under this rules change, the so-called motion to proceed to a bill or nomination cannot be blocked.",
        "But in exchange, the minority gets to offer at least two amendments."

        "Is that right?",
        "That's right.",
        "Typically, even after 60 senators vote to end debate and go to a vote, another 30 hours of debate - which usually ends up being 30 hours of quorum calls - is required before that vote could happen.",
        "With this rules change only one quorum call is allowed, and unless a senator who opposes the vote is able to get his colleagues to help him or her go out and hold the floor, during those 30 hours - and senators can only speak for up to an hour each - a vote would be held immediately.",
        "And that would certainly speed up what's often the glacial pace of business in the Senate.",

        "This is a smaller step.",
        "Yes, these rules changes on the filibuster do fall short of what many Democrats had hoped for.",
        "None of them wanted to do away with the filibuster altogether, lest the Senate end up being like the House where the minority has virtually no power.",
        "But Iowa Democrat Tom Harkin, for example, wanted to progressively lower the threshold of 60 votes on the matter, to eventually get to a simple majority of 51.",
        "And that did not happen.",
        "Harry Reid, the majority leader, wanted to put the onus on the minority to come up with 41 votes to sustain a filibuster, rather than make the majority find 60 votes to move ahead.",
        "That remains unchanged.",
        "And in most cases it's still going to be possible to filibuster in absentia.",
        "That is, senators won't be required to go out and hold the floor, to keep something from coming to a vote.",
