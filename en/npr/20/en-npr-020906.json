        "The IMF actually reacted violently to this and got their public relations officer to write a comment on it.",

        "As for the countries that insisted on capital controls, well, the IMF research department took a look at their experiences, and guess what?",
        "Jonathan Ostry is the deputy research director.",
        "What we find in our work is that countries that did have some restrictions on capital inflows tended to come into this crisis with more equity, less debt, and this served them well in terms of having less of a credit boom, less of a run up in asset prices in the good times, and therefore, less of a bust in the bad times.",
        "Quite a turn around.",
        "Ostry was at the IMF back in 1998, but he doesn't want to talk about that letter criticizing capital controls.",
        "That episode is not at my fingertips right now, but I would just underscore again that, you know, I think our line right now is pragmatism rather than dogmatism.",
        "Pragmatism rather than dogmatism: the new IMF creed.",
        "Ostry, who laid out the IMF view in an official paper last month, says the change has been evolutionary.",
        "Maybe, says Professor Bhagwati, but given how he was once attacked for advocating capital controls, he's thrilled the IMF has finally come around.",
        "Along the way, there were occasional indications, but never so frontally, saying, golly, Bhagwati was right.",
        "And now they have.",
        "I should make clear, Linda, Professor Bhagwati and other international economists still think the movement of capital around the world is generally good for the global economy, but conditions matter.",
        "Some countries are better prepared than others to handle an influx of foreign capital.",
        "So a totally free-market economy, in this case, is not such a good idea?",
        "In this case, Linda, the countries that were most diligent about following all the free-market rules actually fared worse than those countries that dared to challenge those rules."
