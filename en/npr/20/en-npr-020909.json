        "We want to have it not be so focused on the actual encampments and get people in the suburbs more engaged and make them feel like they're really part of the movement rather than just supporters of the movement.",
        "It's an interesting point because as we've seen these crackdowns on encampments from New York to Portland, it does raise the question of how important it is to have a physical presence in the streets.",

        "What we were after was to get people on the council who could make sensible decisions about roads, water, sewer, and those kinds of things.",

        "And lo and behold, in 1996, Palin challenged Stein in the race for mayor.",
        "What turned her against him?",
        "In her memoir, Palin talks about policy differences.",
        "But Mark Chryson thinks there was also a personal motive.",
