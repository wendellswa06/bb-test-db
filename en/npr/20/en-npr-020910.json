        "And that, the president said, would bring domestic spending down to a 50-year low as a share of GDP.",
        "Let me repeat that.",
        "Because of our budget, this share of spending will be at its lowest level since Dwight Eisenhower was president.",
        "That level of spending is lower than it was under the last three administrations.",
        "And it will be lower than it was under Ronald Reagan.",
        "Mr.",
        "Obama said his budget did that by cutting that hearty perennial waste, fraud and abuse, but also by making deep painful cuts in important programs."

        "It will mean cutting things that I care deeply about - for example, community action programs in low-income neighborhoods and towns, and Community Development Block Grants that so many of our cities and states rely on.",

        "By all accounts, this is a very small group and one of several that are seeking independence for Xinjiang, or what they call East Turkestan.",
        "What China says is that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida and the Taliban have all supported this group, and they trained its members at camps in Afghanistan and then sent them back into China to stage attacks.",

        "In 2002, two members of the group were extradited to China from the central Asian public of Kyrgyzstan and accused of trying to blow up the US embassy Kyrgese capital of Bishkek.",
        "So these groups do really exist, and this separatist movement does really exist.",
        "Why the skepticism about China's latest claims?",
        "What China's critics say is that this whole thing is a smokescreen for the repression of a Muslim minority in northwest China called the Uighurs, and a repression of their legitimate demands for political autonomy in their own land.",
        "And they say that China has executed and jailed thousands of Uighurs for essentially non-violent political reasons.",
        "But I think we should also add that while there are a lot of skeptics in the West, countries like Russia and the former Soviet Republics in Central Asia and also countries in the Middle East that are worried about Islamic separatists have essentially supported China's war on terror in its own territories.",
