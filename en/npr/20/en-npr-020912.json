        "For our wounded warriors, it is another day of slow and arduous recovery.",
        "And in this national cemetery, it is another day when grief remains fresh.",

        "It does.",

        "But they are getting closer and they have now narrowed it to four options.",
        "Significantly, all of the options involve sending troops.",
        "So, it is now no longer a question of will more U.S.",

        "So, the four options - lets start with the high end, which, according to an administration official who we spoke to, would be to send about 40,000 additional troops.",
        "Thats what General McChrystal, the top commander in Afghanistan, has asked for.",
        "Thats what he says he needs to pull off a successful counterinsurgency mission there.",
        "The next level down the next option would apparently involve sending almost that many but not quite, maybe 34 or 35,000 troops.",
        "And theres some hope that NATO allies might actually make up the difference, nudge it back up close to 40,000.",
        "Descending from there, there is a third option, would involved 15-20,000 troops.",
        "The implication there is you couldnt really do a proper counterinsurgency strategy, but you could do a narrower counterterrorism-focused mission.",
        "And then were told the fourth option on the table would be to send a low end, something like 10,000 troops.",
        "If you did that, they would all be focused on training, so trying to get Afghanistans police and security forces up to speed where they could take over security themselves.",

        "One thing I'm looking forward to is an emergence of a new dynamic among black leadership, mainly younger African-American leaders to assert themselves and present a new way of looking at things that will put forth a new leadership paradigm in our community.",
        "I guess I'm hopeful that young people who look to movie actors and sport heroes will look towards the man in the White House so that we'll have more kids striving to do well in school, striving to achieve academically, striving to be the next president of the United States.",
        "Well, it's going to mean a variety of a different things because not all black Americans think alike.",
        "Not all black Americans have the same objectives.",
        "To other African-Americans it's going to mean higher taxes for their small businesses.",
