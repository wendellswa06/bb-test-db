        "We've brought in David Wessell, Deputy Washington Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal.",
        "David, good morning.",
        "Good morning.",
        "And when we see fears of inflation, is inflation really going up?",
        "Yes, inflation is definitely going up, largely because energy prices are up.",
        "Over the last 12 months, energy prices are up 18 percent, so the overall consumer price index is up 3.5 percent for the 12 months ending in April, and that's somewhat higher than it's been.",
        "The question is, is that spilling over into the prices of non-energy goods and services, and that's the big mystery right now.",
        "Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, made a clearer statement that he used to make, although with lots of qualifiers, saying that he thought it was now beginning to spill over.",
        "Well, Alan Greenspan is history.",
        "What really matters now is what Ben Bernanke, the new Fed Chairman believes.",
        "And in a speech recently he made clear that he's worried that inflation is at the upper bound of what he and other Fed officials feel is comfortable.",
        "Which is significant because he's the guy who might have the power to do something about that, which I guess would be raise interest rates.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The financial markets interpreted his last statement as a clear signal that he's going to raise interest rates at the end of June, and now there's some speculation that he'll keep raising them after that, which is a change of view.",
        "People had been thinking he might take a pause because the economy seems to be slowing down.",
        "Now, tomorrow we'll find out something more about inflation because the government will release its latest consumer price index.",
        "But at the same time there are some people who say that consumer price index does not fairly represent what people have to pay for things."

        "That's right.",
        "I mean, every time I write a story in the Wall Street Journal about the consumer price index, someone writes me a letter saying, but that's not my experience.",
        "And I think that that reflects, sometimes, a misunderstanding of what the consumer price index actually is.",
        "It's an average.",
        "It's the price of a basket of goods and services that actually is typical of what no one person actually spends.",
        "I mean, for instance, college tuition is 1.1 percent of the consumer price index basket.",
        "I have a daughter in college, and I can assure you that college tuition is far more than 1 percent of what I spend.",
        "So when they raise prices 6 or 8 percent, as they do, it's a much bigger increase in my personal inflation rate.",
        "But that doesn't mean the CPI is inaccurate.",
        "But officially they want me to say it's sort of like guitar.",
        "We called the embassy, they said, Qatar is fine, everyone pronounces it that way anyway.",

        "So you have arrived to talk to us about some of your favorite entries so far, but I just want to ask you this question, which is, when you laid out the challenge, right, that every story has to begin: Some people swore that the house was haunted, they all had to end: Nothing was ever the same again after that, just remind us why you did that.",
        "I wanted to give all those writers out there something kind of juicy and ambiguous to work with.",
        "And if I was surprised by anything, I was surprised by how gruesome a lot of them were.",
        "Who are you people out there, and what's the matter with you, anyway?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And of course, having said that, it turns out that one of the two that I responded to the most strongly is arguably the most shocking and gruesome in the whole batch.",
        "Indeed.",
        "I want to - and I should mention, Michael, that all the stories we pass along to you, you do not know the name or the place where the writer is from.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I don't think it is an entirely successful story, but it is a very original story.",
        "It was one of the relatively few I saw that took that opening line and went in an unexpected direction with it.",
        "Can you read a few lines from it?",
        "Yeah."
