        "Well, let me drill down on something that's not vague.",
        "Cohen testified yesterday, so we're talking about public testimony - testified that he briefed members of the Trump family, Ivanka and Don Jr., about plans to build a Trump property in Moscow, that he briefed them about 10 times.",

        "Just one last question, and it's this.",
        "As I watched the hearing unfold yesterday, which we keep referring to 'cause that was the one that we can - we all saw unfold in public, the Republican strategy appeared to be attacking Cohen as a liar and as not credible.",
        "And the challenge seems to be how you square that with the fact that Michael Cohen was among the president's closest confidants and giving him legal advice for a decade.",
        "Yeah.",

        "We can really follow a line of questioning.",
        "It's a very different experience.",
