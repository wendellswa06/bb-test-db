        "He said he's surprised and disappointed with the murky outcome.",
        "The biggest disaster that could happen, that they are both at the same level and there's no clear decision and we just have to form a ...(unintelligible) coalition now.",
        "Matias Kunaker(ph) voted for Schroeder and the SPD.",
        "He says the Christian Democrats would have done better with a different candidate.",
        "I'm not surprised because I know that the conservatives put the wrong horse in the elections.",
        "Angela Merkel was the wrong horse.",
        "The CDU lost some key constituencies, and by all counts, the results were a big blow to Angela Merkel.",
        "She was the first chancellor candidate from former East Germany, so the CDU had hoped to do well there.",
        "They didn't, getting only a quarter of the vote.",
        "Merkel also performed worse than expected in her home state as well as the CDU's traditional strongholds in south Germany.",
        "Kristoff Shult(ph) is a political editor with the Germany weekly Der Spiegel.",
        "Such a loss and such a bad result always has something to do with the candidate, and everybody thought that as a first woman candidate she would reach the hearts of the Germans much easier, but she didn't.",
        "Any time you come in confrontation with somebody, you never know what they've got on them or what they're doing.",
        "So your nerves is what you've got; it's what keeps you running.",
        "It's not so much fear as it is being concerned for your safety.",

        "Thank you very much.",
        "The AP1000 plant that was approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, it's built by Westinghouse, it's something of a white knight, if you will, because as you said, the nuclear industry has been feeble, if you will, for a long time and for very many reasons: financial reasons, for safety reasons, for public skepticism."

        "And the AP1000 has had a long history.",

        "This isn't going to work.",
        "They went back to the drawing boards.",
        "They made it bigger to get economies of scale, and they tried to make it safer and simpler, to make it cheaper.",
        "And so they came up with the AP1000.",
        "It's a big plant.",
        "It's over 1,000 megawatts, and the NRC now says we like the way it looks, we think it's safe.",
        "There's still some hoops to jump through.",
        "They still need to get certification for construction, and then again NRC has to approve an operating license.",
        "Those probably shouldn't be difficult.",
        "So we might see new reactors by 2016, 2017.",
        "So this is a long process indeed.",
        "And how many?",
        "There will be two in Georgia and two in South Carolina, at least that's what - they're undergoing - they're the farthest along in terms of licensing, and they have money.",
        "And money is a big question.",
        "It's one thing to have a design that people like, and there are good things about the design.",
        "I mean the design is the so-called passive design.",
        "It's much safer in the sense that it doesn't have - it doesn't need all the electrical equipment to make it - to bring in coolant if there's a loss-of-coolant accident.",
        "A lot of so-called passive design, you use gravity, you use convection to bring cooling water in.",
        "It's a standardized design, and so in the sense you don't have to build a different plant every time.",
        "All the nuclear plants I think this now were one-off, you know, and that just doesn't make financial sense.",
        "They've trying for years in the industry to do a standardized design and say look, get one that's good, it works well, standardize it, we can all build the same one, and it's cheaper that way.",
        "So that's to its advantage.",
        "But there's still the financial world, which is very reluctant to invest in nuclear power, and that's been a big stumbling block.",
        "Because per kilowatt hour, it's still pretty expensive.",
        "Yes, and, you know, it takes a long time.",
        "It takes a long time to build a coal plant, too, but a nuclear plant is - there's so much more to it, and it takes - the permit process is so long.",
        "You know, you go to a bank, and you say I need to borrow billions and billions of dollars, oh and by the way, I won't have any money to pay back the interest for another five or six years."

        "And, you know, no nuclear - a nuclear power plant doesn't operate in a vacuum.",
        "It has to compete with other sources of energy like coal and natural gas.",
        "But then you talk about natural gas.",
        "Natural gas presents problems of its own.",
        "Yes, it turns out there's a lot of natural gas that we can now access through the fracking drilling techniques that have become so popular.",
        "They've also become pretty controversial.",
        "They have, and these are new days for fracking.",
        "Fracking is not, you know, it's a new technology, much newer than nuclear, for example, and it's being used in places, well recently like in Pennsylvania, in new geological formations where they're having some trouble, you know, controlling the pollution of groundwater, and then there are numerous other problems.",
        "There's state regulations that just aren't ready to deal with this new technology.",
        "However, when you look at the kind of things that need to be done in order to make fracking safe compared to what needs to be done to make coal less polluting and safe, what needs to be done to get rid of nuclear waste and to make nuclear power plants safe, I think a lot of people will tell you that the obstacles are much lower for fracking, that these are solvable problems for less money than solving the big problems of coal and nuclear.",
        "Yet nuclear, one of its advantages is it does not add carbon emissions to the environment.",
        "It is green in that respect.",
        "Yes, you've got to figure out a way to dispose of that nuclear spent fuel, but it does not add to climate change.",
        "And that was the, sort of, the calling card that nuclear pulled out of its pocket during the 1990s, and hey look, folks, now that people started to get serious about climate change, they could say hey, we're clean.",
        "I mean, we don't emit carbon.",
        "That's great.",
        "But that hasn't been enough to push it over, and furthermore, we've seen that the public opinion on climate change took a nosedive in the sense that people got a little less worried about it, and there was no carbon price.",
        "So if - without a price on carbon coal remains cheap, and so it's still an argument that they don't win financially.",
        "Well, if - we're at the same stage that Germany was.",
        "They weren't building any new power plants.",
        "They were talking about extending the life of their old power plants, and they've decided not to do that.",
        "They say they're going to do this with renewable energy.",
        "How are they able to do it, and we're not?",
        "Good question.",
        "I would like to go over and find out.",
        "In fact, that's something that I hope to be doing.",
        "So this is something that the Germans claim that they can do.",
        "They're going to have to use probably more natural gas, which does create carbon."

        "They are probably going to be using nuclear power wheeled in from France.",
        "So if they can manage to do it, though, if the Germans can manage to get baseload, regular, 24/7 power out of renewables, then, you know, they could take away the last argument that nuclear has.",
        "Baseload, what does that mean?",
        "Well, in the sense that it works 24 hours a day, you know, seven days a week.",
        "It's consistent, you know, unlike solar power and wind power.",
        "You don't have to worry about when the wind doesn't blow, you don't to worry about when the sun's not shining.",
        "And you can produce a great deal of power, and you're not down a lot of the time, whether for repair or for lack of a source of energy, and that coal and nuclear are the very best at that because their fuel is cheap, they run consistently, efficiently, and it's just the way our big cities need electricity.",

        "But instead what I would recommend for our baseload, a very challenging project, which would involve a superconductivity loop from the Rocky Mountains to the Appalachians in which ambient lightning could be harnessed because that's been the whole problem harnessing lightning is that there's such an incredible amount of energy that goes energy that goes in as to how to dissipate it.",
