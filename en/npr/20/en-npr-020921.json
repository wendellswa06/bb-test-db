        "Yeah, the interesting statistic on wind is it's one of the fastest growing sources of energy in the world and in this country, but it's still tiny because it's starting out from such a low point.",
        "And again, there's a situation with where do you find the best wind.",
        "You know, you can build a wind turbine somewhere, but if you don't have a lot of wind, then it's not going to be price competitive.",
        "So you build it where there's the best wind, well, in the Great Plains.",
        "And, well, that's great for people in the Great Plains, but how do you get the electricity to the East, where a lot of the demand is?",
        "And you can't store it.",
        "So...",
        "Yeah, that's another technology we could talk about.",

        "Some, like the Sierra Club, say there's no such thing as safe nuclear energy and no long-term plan to securely dispose of nuclear waste.",
        "Others, like the Breakthrough Institute, say nuclear power is worth it because it does not make climate change worse, like fossil fuels do.",
        "Is there a better way to generate the 20 percent of our electrical power that comes from nuclear plants right now, nuclear plants that start coming offline in the next 10 years or so?",

        "A couple of brief comments, I agree very much with what your guest just mentioned in terms of the fact that a lot of these ideas that we have, you know, going really big on solar, really big on tidal, really big on wind, are decades out in terms of getting the technology to where we would need it to be actually a legitimate power source, whereas as he just mentioned, we've got two nuclear plants almost ready to go in Georgia and South Carolina, North Anna 4 in Central Virginia, Calvert Cliffs 3, which is several years out because of roadblocks.",

        "The biggest issue, as somebody I heard over the summer say, was not just NIMBY, not in my backyard, but also a lot of people have this thing that called BANANA, build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything.",
        "And when we look at nuclear, the big issue in my opinion as a teacher is education.",
        "There's so little understood by the general public about nuclear and about the actual legitimate dangers and about the actual legitimate promises of it.",
        "I mean, for example the energy density of it, the entire amount of energy that you will consume, the amount of fuel that you will consume in your entire lifetime, Neal, would fit in a soda can in terms of the uranium fuel pellets.",

        "And we've - obviously could have taken advocates from any number of points of view.",
        "We've decided to talk with you to day as a supporter of nuclear energy even after Fukushima Dai-ichi, which of course the costs of that in terms of billions and decades have yet to be measured.",
        "Yeah, and I should just context this by saying that we're actually advocates of all low-carbon sources of energy.",
        "I mean, we've been big advocates for increasing the amount of money we spend on renewable energy R&D from about the $2 billion that we spend annually today to about $15 billion, and another $15 billion on top of that just to, you know, to buy down and to be buying the advanced technologies: solar, wind, advanced nuclear, the rest.",
        "And really we've been advocates of renewables for 10 years.",
        "It's only been in the last few years that we've increasingly lost confidence that we can scale up renewables in the time period that we need to scale them up in order to radically reduce emissions.",
        "And that's made us - that's forced us to take a harder look at nuclear energy.",
        "And that's kind of been a - it's been a gradual process of coming back around to supporting nuclear energy as folks concerned about the environment.",
        "I mean, I think people forget that the environmental movement was largely pro-nuclear up until the late '60s because it was a way to generate pollution-free electricity and also not have to build hydroelectric dams, which destroy natural landscapes.",
        "So it's been - so I think we're advocates of all these advanced energy technologies, and I think it would just be incredibly foolish to take nuclear off the table."

        "If you actually look at deaths per energy source, nuclear comes out as one of the best.",
        "I think only wind out-performs nuclear, and that even counts the expected deaths from Fukushima because of course there haven't been any deaths yet from it.",
        "The estimates are of some - I think between one and 3,000 eventual cancer deaths from Fukushima, which is obviously serious and of concern, but, you know, in the context of catastrophic climate change risk, you know, in the context of the, you know, thousands of coal miners who die every year, you know, the Deepwater Horizon, fossil energy, all energy production is quite dangerous, including solar panel production.",
        "I mean, people think solar panels are clean.",
        "When they install them on their house, they're clean, but when you manufacture them in a place like China, you get all sorts of industrial waste.",
        "There was even a riot in one of the towns near a solar panel production, solar factory in China earlier this year because the company had dumped so much waste in the river.",
        "So energy production is a dirty business, and I think it's - you're really having to make some hard choices.",
        "I think it's been - within the environmental community, I think an idea took hold in the late '60s that no, no, there was this really easy way to do it, it would just be solar panels and wind turbines and water wheels and, you know, insulation in our homes, and we would never need to have fossil energy or nuclear energy.",
        "And I think that for those of us that kind of, you know, grew up in the post-'60s era, even with growing up with \"\"The Simpsons\"\" as an anti-nuclear TV show, I think when we take a hard look at a world that is going to consume three times more energy over the next century and the need to zero out all emissions from energy production, I mean go to zero by the end of the century, it's just hard to see how you do that without a lot of nuclear energy.",
        "And how do you do that without, as our previous caller said, running into the BANANA problem, build absolutely nothing anywhere?",
        "Right, that is the big issue.",
        "I mean, I think what we have - I mean, I think long term, we're optimistic that various publics around the world are going to come back to nuclear.",
