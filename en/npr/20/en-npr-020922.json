        "And if I could just end with one thing, we have a new e-book out called \"\"Love Your Monsters,\"\" and the title essay comes from - I mean the title comes from an essay by a very good French anthropologist who describes the Frankenstein myth and says, you know, really, this is a parable for our attitude towards technology.",
