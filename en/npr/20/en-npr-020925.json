        "So Adam, are there big differences between Edwards and the other Democrats as he says?",
        "Rhetorically, they are radically different.",
        "When you actually get into the substance of their policies, the differences start to go away.",
        "All three of the leading Democratic presidential candidates hope that President Bush's big tax cuts that are due to end in 2010 will just go away.",
        "They don't want those tax cuts made permanent.",
        "All have various ways to increase taxes on wealthier people and to lower the tax burden on middle class and lower-income people.",
        "All have very large spending plans for health care.",
        "I would say that Edwards probably has more aggressive tax cuts for the poor and middle class, has more aggressive tax increases for the wealthier people.",
        "But on spending - his spending plan seem to be even less than Hillary Clinton's or Barack Obama's.",

        "Well, she has a big spending proposal.",
        "We're talking about 25 billion that would go to help poor people pay for their energy bills.",
        "There's more than $30 billion to help people pay for their mortgages, who might otherwise go into default.",
        "We're talking about a huge spending plan.",
        "So we've talked about Edwards.",
        "We talked about Hillary Clinton.",
        "What about Barack Obama?",
        "Obama has not released his fiscal stimulus package yet.",
        "But in the specifics that he has released, when it comes to taxes, when it comes to spending, it's pretty standard stuff.",
        "Probably, Obama's unique idea is this idea that senior citizens will pay no taxes at all if they make less than $50,000 a year.",
        "Now, that's obviously an idea that's going to be extremely popular among seniors who make less than $50,000.",
        "But the people I talked to, the policy wonks told me this is not a fiscally prudent policy.",
        "It will be very hard to afford it."

        "It went from 68 percent then to now 80 percent, which is almost the same level as Democrats.",
        "And that is really striking and should be a huge warning sign to the Democratic Party because all year, we've been talking about how Democratic enthusiasm has been outstripping Republicans and how that could lead to this eventual blue wave.",
        "You know, everything Republicans have tried to increase this enthusiasm so far had fallen flat.",
        "Whether it was tax cuts or talking up the broader economy, even the threat of impeachment to the president, nothing really fired up the Republican base until now.",
        "Is it clear that this is all about Kavanaugh?",
        "Well, look; I asked that question of our pollster Lee Miringoff of Marist, and his response was this - quote, \"\"the result of hearings, at least in the short run, is the Republican base has awakened.\"\" So it does appear, yes, it has been the Kavanaugh hearings because we polled a week earlier, and we've seen this change.",
        "He also stressed that there's - a month from the election, any number of things can and have happened in that amount of time.",
        "And whether Kavanaugh eventually gets through or is eventually sunk will really have some influence on how fired up Republican voters are.",
        "Anything can happen in those 34 days.",
        "We've now heard from Kavanaugh and from his accuser Christine Blasey Ford.",
        "What does the poll show about who people say they believe?",
        "Well, this is really important.",
        "And more are saying they believe Christine Blasey Ford than Brett Kavanaugh.",
        "That was true narrowly when we polled a couple days before the hearing, and it only has grown afterward.",
        "About half of people say they believe Ford, while only about a third say they believe Kavanaugh.",
        "And that's been an increased margin from last week.",
        "And at first blush, as Danielle mentioned earlier, men and women are starkly divided, but it's really a partisan divide.",
        "And actually, what's really interesting here is that the largest group of people that say that they believe Ford in the poll - that she's telling the truth - Democratic men."
