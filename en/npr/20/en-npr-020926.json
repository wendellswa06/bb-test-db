        "Calls for impeaching a Supreme Court justice are unusual, so joining me now is NPR's senior political editor Domenico Montanaro.",
        "Welcome to the studio.",
        "Hey there, Audie.",
        "The basic question - what does it take to impeach a Supreme Court justice?",
        "When was the last time that even happened?",
        "It's the same process for impeaching a president.",
        "You need a majority in the House to impeach, but that doesn't remove someone.",
        "It has to go to the Senate for that, where two-thirds of the senators is needed to convict.",
        "The last Supreme Court justice, by the way, to be impeached was Samuel Chase way back in 1804.",
        "A year later, though, the Senate declined to convict him.",
        "The federal judges that have been removed, and it's only been eight in the last 200 years, mostly have been convicted of things like making false statements, showing favoritism, being drunk on the bench or abusing their ability to hold people in contempt.",
        "In this case, obviously, Democrats don't have control of the Senate, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said there's no chance that he's going to bring this forward, and he called it an unhinged personal attack.",
        "And yet, California Senator Kamala Harris is among those who are calling for impeachment.",
        "She defended the idea to NPR's Noel King this morning.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)",
        "There's not been an investigation with the level of attention that normally would occur around these kinds of allegations, and especially related to the subject at hand, which is the appropriateness of this individual serving on the highest court of our land for a lifetime appointment.",
        "What's the benefit to a Democratic candidate to take this stance?",
        "She's not the only one."

        "Yeah, sure.",
        "I mean, she addressed the fact that she's running for president in an - in her interview this morning.",
        "She said that she knew that that would be part of the criticism but thought that it was important to bring up anyway.",
        "But let's face it.",
        "She is running for president.",
        "And, you know, she needs to raise her profile.",
        "And any Democratic strategist would say, today, it worked.",
        "This is something that the base loves.",
        "They feel that Kavanaugh lied and that the FBI did a very cursory investigation.",
        "And when we polled on impeaching the president, for example, three-quarters of Democrats said that they were in favor of it.",
        "But it's a different story with congressional leadership.",
        "I should point you to today.",
        "New York Democrat Jerry Nadler - he chairs the House Judiciary Committee and would shepherd any impeachment proceedings.",
        "He said he's far more focused on investigating the president and not going forward with a Kavanaugh impeachment.",
        "So any impeachment proceeding would have to start in the House, as we laid out earlier.",
        "So that avenue appears closed.",
        "And is his reluctance a sign of the risks for Democrats?",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "I mean, and that's why you don't see Nadler or other moderates in the Senate jumping on this.",
        "You don't even need polls, really, to tell you that.",
        "I mean, just look at the body language today.",
        "President Trump, Mitch McConnell - they're happy to take this issue on and blast Democrats and keep it front and center, whereas moderates like Doug Jones of Alabama, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota - they're saying that they need more evidence to begin any kind of impeachment proceeding against Kavanaugh, even though they say the process was a sham, in Klobuchar's words, and Jones said that if Kavanaugh lied that he could be impeached.",
        "You know, but judicial nominations - those are key to President Trump's base and to his political support.",
        "But clearly, this process would make moderates feel very uncomfortable.",
        "Each animal they want to study presents different challenges, whether it's getting a blood sample from a snail or figuring out how to keep deep sea fish alive in the lab.",
        "It's also not always so obvious what effects to look for.",
        "A change in acid can actually impose a subtle energy tax on marine animals.",
        "They already use some energy pumping acid out of their cells to maintain a healthy pH.",
        "As the oceans get more acidic, Pane says they'll expend more energy to maintain that balance.",
        "You're going to have less energy available for the important things: growing, reproducing.",
        "We're going to be looking at fecundity, amount of offspring produced, health of offspring produced, and then try to extrapolate into a long-term approach what that's going to do to these ecosystems that we know.",
        "It's too early to say just yet what this portends for life at sea, up to and including the fat and happy sea lions down on the dock.",
        "I think the least we can say is there's going to be profound changes in ocean ecosystems.",
        "From there, where we go and the judgments we make about that, you know, perhaps is an issue for further on.",
        "But…",
        "People think marine biology sounds really exciting.",
        "Your career almost sounds depressing."

        "And you can't just transfer that much mass without making changes in the physical properties, as well as the biological properties.",
        "Brewer says the carbon dioxide has already altered ocean chemistry in such a way that it affects the way sound travels through the ocean.",
        "That effect will grow, as more and more carbon dioxide ends up in the sea.",
        "Sound will travel farther and noise levels will rise.",
        "That's a strange result of ocean acidification.",
        "What consequences does that have?",
        "Nobody is that sure.",
        "It will be about, say, a 40 percent change by the middle of the century from the pre-Industrial signal.",
        "One assumes that whales, which communicate at these frequencies, will sense this effect.",
        "Whether they will adapt their communication patterns, one does not know.",
        "Scientists may simply have to wait and watch to see how that unintentional experiment evolves.",

        "Studying animals on the sea floor would, after all, be a more realistic experiment than a lab study, presuming they can get the instrument to do a good job of simulating future ocean conditions.",
        "It'll probably take another year to sort out the technical challenges of getting this instrument to work well.",
