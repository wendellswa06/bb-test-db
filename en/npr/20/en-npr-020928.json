        "In fact, volunteers have painted names on these empty streets so people have some way to get their bearings and what used to be Main Street or Pine Street or - because without a house, without a marker, without way to tell where you are, it's very disorienting.",

        "Initially, for example, those programs did not allow you to go over 105 percent of loan to value.",
        "Obviously, because Nevada was so hard hit, people were very upside down, and still continue to be.",
        "So, the refinance pieces, for those who may have a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loan, just didn't work for Nevada.",
        "The second thing is lenders.",

        "Why is it then that the banks are not acting more aggressively to keep people in their homes, to stem the tide of foreclosures?",

        "In some instances, consumers could afford the payment and are willing to pay, they just can't pay at the rate and the payment they currently have.",
        "Unless you are willing to sit down and analyze the group of consumers that you have in your portfolio, I don't think you can say it's not in my best interest, as a general statement.",
        "There are lots and lots of stories about people who would love to live in their house, would love to keep it in some way, but are so underwater with their mortgage that it just doesn't make financial sense to keep on paying and to stay in their house.",
