        "It's very strange that one of the things that's happening here in core inflation is actually a reflection of a perspective weakening in housing activity, which you would expect to be disinflationary.",

        "Now, Daschle says it wasn't part of his compensation deal - it was more of a favor from a friend who owns the firm.",

        "And there's also, I think, the issue of just how much money Daschle was making - something in the neighborhood of $5 million since he left the Senate, including more than $200,000 from the health interests that he will be regulating as the secretary of Health and Human Services.",
