        "How would you describe, in general, the food you serve here?",
        "Can someone peg it?",
        "It's very hard to put a one- or two-word phrase on it.",
        "I think what we're in now is we're in kind of this stage where a lot of younger chefs are expressing themselves and using a lot of these new techniques and technologies that have come about in the last five years.",
        "And so they're really creating a new style of cooking, a new style of eating.",
        "And so it really hasn't been defined yet; it doesn't really have a label yet.",
        "Achatz is trim, laid-back and freckled.",
        "He's only 31, and he hardly looks that, but he's already got an impressive resume: sous-chef at the fabled French Laundry in California; James Beard Rising Star Chef of the Year in 2003; and praise for his work at Trio, the Chicago restaurant where he was chef before opening his first solo venture here at Alinea.",
        "Achatz wants to create entirely new tastes, and to do it, he's looking beyond even the most modern kitchen appliances.",
        "For instance, we have, like, very specially designed freezers that get negative 50 degrees below 0.",
        "So instead of just being kind of handcuffed to what's available in the restaurant industry, we may go to a medical supply house that does superrefrigerants.",
        "You know...",
        "Is that even colder than a subzero fridge?",
        "Yeah, it's--negative 50 degrees Celsius is darned cold.",
        "And what does that allow you to do?",
        "It allows you to freeze things obviously instantly.",
        "It allows you to freeze layers of things, so you create different textures.",
        "So the surface that's in contact with that negative 50 degrees becomes extremely brittle, and it freezes so quickly that it allows certain other areas of that foodstuff to remain soft or, you know...",
        "Can you give me an example?",
        "What's a dish that would come out of that freezer?",
        "There's one that we do involving sour cream where we literally just put a dollop of sour cream on this cold plate--and that's what we call this device that gets so cold.",
        "And obviously, the part that makes contact with the cold plate freezes instantly.",
        "We put a dollop on, we put a sprig of oxalis, or wild sorrel, in there and it freezes so fast that it allows the sorrel to freeze right into the sour cream, but still be unfrozen 'cause it's not making contact with this cold plate.",
        "And so now you have created sour cream that has a brittle texture on the bottom, and then it graduates up through softness, and you can actually touch the top of the dollop of sour cream and it's whatever temperature that you put it on.",
        "So you have degrees of texture through the sour cream.",
        "You put it in your mouth, you crunch down, you feel the crispiness of extremely frozen sour cream and you feel the creaminess of sour cream like you know it that you put on your baked potato."

        "So the notion that Greenland's ice will largely slide into the sea this century is far off the mark.",

        "He and his colleagues came up with three scenarios, now published in Science magazine.",
        "They all assume that ice will flow much faster to the sea than it's flowing today, from twice as fast to about 10 times as fast, and that gives him an upper limit of sea level rise.",
        "It's somewhere between two feet and six feet this century.",
        "Glacier scientist Ian Joughin at the University of Washington says six feet, or two meters, would require glaciers to undergo some very dramatic and rapid shifts into conditions more extreme than anyone has ever witnessed."
