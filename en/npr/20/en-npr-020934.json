        "I've been filling in here for the past year, and it's been a privilege and great fun talking with all of you each weekend.",
        "Heartfelt thanks to those who wrote or e-mailed kind words about the stories we've done, and also to those who took the time to send critiques and comments.",

        "But the question is: How you going to find out exactly what, you know, caused that piece to come off?",

        "But it looked OK.",
        "So it's going to be hard in retrospect to say, `Oh, we know why that came off and here's how we can fix it.",
        "They could redesign that part of the shuttle where the foam--that part of the tank where the foam came off, but then you have to ask yourself whether you've really solved the problem in a big sense and whether foam isn't going to come off elsewhere."
