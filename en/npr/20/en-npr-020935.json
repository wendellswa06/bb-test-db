        "But Green says the numbers weren't all rosy.",
        "US attitudes towards Islam as a religion remain generally less positive than opinions on Muslim Americans.",
        "The report shows just 39 percent of those surveyed think positively about the faith itself.",
        "But overall, Green says the findings are positive.",
        "I think it does suggest a certain growing sophistication on the part of American public to understand that Islam is a great religion that is diverse and that the source of terrorism is really a very small group within that larger religious community."
