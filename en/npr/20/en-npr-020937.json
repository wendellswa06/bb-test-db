        "And it just dawned on us that, you know, given the state of the industry, if we weren't going to put out our records then our music would probably never get heard.",
        "And fast forward 10-plus years later this is it.",
        "So what was it like performing for the first time in a venue, not in a dorm room, not just with your friends, where were you and what was that like?",
        "I think the first, what I would consider the first show was - I was the very first act on a show at a club here in San Francisco called The Stone.",
        "And on that bill it was pretty amazing.",
        "I mean I was absolutely first in order on a bill of like …",
        "Which is a blessing and a curse.",

I'm not sure what you did to me, but I like it, I love it",

        "It's like how can I, you know, I'm always asking myself the question, what am I going to do tomorrow?",
        "And I think going into this album, you know, I asked myself that same question and it was OK, the answer was I'm going to make this album more personal.",

        "Like I said, I mean, you know, it's important for me to stay continually challenged.",

        "You were born Tom Shimura in Tokyo, raised, you know a bunch of different places, and you used to go by the name Asia Born on stage.",
        "So when and why did you change your stage name?",
        "I changed it in 1994 and really it was because what was happening was, I started getting a lot of press as being quote unquote, the Asian rapper, the Japanese rapper, the Asian one, the Japanese guy.",
        "You know and I think like most I think you people of color in this country, or just anybody in this country, we all want to be evaluated based on our merits, you know, and our skill.",
        "Especially when you're an artist you want to be evaluated based on your art.",
        "And I thought that, you know, being singled out in that way, I didn't think it was fair to us as a group and I didn't think it was fair to myself.",
        "And so, you know, I wanted to make albums where I would be evaluated as the artist.",
        "You know, nobody wants to be called the Asian actor or the Asian plumber, you know what I mean, or the Asian DJ.",
        "You're just a man, you're an artist."
