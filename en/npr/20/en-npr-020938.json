        "If Congress were to do something and expand background checks, would it have done anything about that case?",
        "Right.",
        "So, I mean, it really kind of plays into this overarching thing where we see in politics that, essentially, lawmakers are playing whack-a-mole when it comes to firearms and firearm legislation because there are so many gaps.",
        "So private sales don't have background checks.",
        "Even if they do, you know, we have this issue of these homemade, unserialized (ph) weapons, where under the 1968 Gun Control Act, that's something that citizens are legally allowed to do.",
        "They're allowed to build weapons that don't have serial numbers, that don't have, you know, a background check process or paperwork attached to them.",
