        "Being named poet laureate was exciting but completely unexpected, says Joy Harjo.",
        "I think the first thing that comes to mind is that it's such an honoring for Native people in this country when we've been so disappeared and disregarded.",
        "And yet we're the root cultures.",
        "Harjo, a member of the Muscogee Creek Nation, has always drawn on Native American myths and stories in her work.",
        "She says that's because her culture is just part of who she is.",
        "And poetry draws her closer to it.",
        "So it doesn't necessarily become a self-conscious thing.",
        "It's just there.",
        "You have your culture and you're in it, but you're also in this American culture, and that's another layer.",
        "So there's always all of these imprints, but, of course, the primal imprint - the primal imprint for all of us is being a human being on Earth.",
        "As a Native American woman, Harjo says it's inevitable that she would be innately political, but she doesn't view the position of poet laureate as political.",
        "She says she's always been an ambassador for poetry and wants to continue in that role.",
        "But she's also aware that she's taking on a prominent national position at a time of great division in our country.",
        "She believes poetry has the power to heal.",
        "Poetry has been one of my fiercest teachers with language, with sound, shot through the heart.",
        "It becomes a way to communicate.",
        "So we're all part of a large poem, a large story.",
        "And if you look with perspective, the story all fits together.",
        "And one way to find those connections is with poetry.",
        "This excerpt from the poem \"\"The Fight\"\" reflects Joy Harjo's desire to find common ground.",
        "(Reading) I grow tired of the heartache of every small and large war passed from generation to generation.",
        "But it is not in me to give up.",
        "I was taught to give honor to the house of the warriors, which cannot exist without the house of the peacemakers.",
        "Harjo is the author of eight books of poetry, with a new collection due out in August.",
        "She has also written a memoir, and at the age of 40, she took up the saxophone.",

        "Now when Harjo performs, she often sets her own poetry to music and includes Native American instruments and musicians.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "I think of the lush stillness of the end of a world sung into place by singers and the rattle of turtles in the dark morning.",
        "Harjo doesn't yet know exactly what she wants to do as poet laureate, but she's got some ideas.",
        "One thing I've always wanted to do is have cowboys and Indians poetry reading (laughter).",
        "Just there's a lot of Indian cowboys and vice versa, I'm sure.",
        "So I really believe if people sat, you know, together and hear their deepest feelings and thoughts beyond any political divisiveness, it makes connections.",
        "Then there's Remy Smith, aka Remy Ma.",
        "She's one of only three female rappers to reach number one on the billboard charts.",
        "That was for a single called \"\"Lean Back\"\" by the Terror Squad.",
        "Now, she's got some bigger things on her mind.",

        "Now, Jasmyne, you blogged about them and asked why can't these successful artists stay out of trouble?",
        "So why can't these successful artists stay out of trouble?",
        "You know, I don't know, but I'm willing to bet though that their album, this will definitely help boost album sales.",
        "I think it's a shame, actually.",
        "I mean you're given this opportunity that very few have, and it's almost as if you squander it.",
        "I mean it's, you know, no different from sort of Art Kelly and some of the other, you know, entertainers that find themselves in all of this trouble.",
        "And it just, you know, it really just goes to show that regardless of the money and the fame, that people still don't know how to act pretty much.",
        "You know, they just don't know how to act.",
        "They don't know what to do with it, and it reminded me at some point of that old saying that we have, and I might mess it up, but like how you could take the person out of the hood but you can't take the hood out the person?"

        "He needs to be doing this and he needs to really be honest about this and needs to try to really show them that he's turning his life around.",

        "He was convicted.",
        "He's another rapper, popular rapper from the Wu-Tan clan.",

        "Now, this is the man who's lied about smoking weed.",
        "He did the stone movie \"\"How High.\"\" I don't know if he walked into the classroom with a wink-wink while he was talking about, you know - I mean how high were the people who sentenced him when they asked him to do that kind of community service?",
        "I think, I mean I'm sure somebody behind the scenes thought it was a little amusing to be sending Method Man of all people to do an anti-drug just-say-no type thing.",
        "But you know, sometimes maybe those are the people who you need to hear from versus, you know, the clean cut, you know, I've always been a good person and led the straight and narrow path, like those are the people who might reach a kid like that more than anybody else.",
        "I think, you know, if TI walks into your classroom, you might be more likely to listen to him as versus, I don't even know who's a clean rapper anymore.",
        "I don't know, like a Will Smith type guy who you can't relate to at all.",

        "We've got political commentator Jasmyne Cannick of Jasmynecannick.com and Patrice Elizabeth Grell Yursik of Afrobella.com, Robert Redding who publishes the Reddingnewsreview.com.",
        "We have been talking about hip-hop and all of the various manifestations of bad behavior.",
        "But there's a flip side, which is when politics and rap can and do mix, and there is a little bit more of a positive or political side to it, the rap star Big Boy, half of Atlanta's dynamic duo OutKast, is working on a new album.",
        "He's got a single, \"\"Royal Flush,\"\" and it includes some political verses.",
        "You know, he says impeach the president because he don't think before he talk.",

        "So I know the music of OutKast very well.",
        "So when I heard this, I said this is a natural progression, it seems, like for OutKast at this point, because he's made some political statements after \"\"Speaker Box,\"\" their last album that they did together.",
        "Of course this is his album.",
        "So I found it significant when I heard it on Greg Street's show in Atlanta when I was listening online, and I said this is something that has to be written about.",

        "I mean, I definitely think OutKast is a good group to do it.",

        "Right.",
        "Well, let's move out to the larger question of how political messages are conveyed.",
        "The New York Times reported that media organizations are cutting back on coverage of the White House race.",
        "Now, some of the biggest newspapers like USA Today, some of the television stations, are thinning the numbers of reporters they send out or the number of days they're on the campaign trail.",

        "Well, first of all, we lose that the last time Obama spoke, he spoke to 20,000 people, and we lose what he said to those people and the things that happen as a result of walking up to the podium and walking down from the podium and the fact that he probably shook just about half the people's hands, and they probably said some important things to him.",
        "Look, I've been talking about the fact that we're cutting back in terms of the presidential campaign for about a month now, and I was kind of pooh-poohed by one of your guests, I can't remember who it was.",
        "I'm not taking it personal, but the fact is I saw this thing coming, we wrote an article about it, and I also saw this attack that has befallen the campaign coming as well, because what I see in the mainstream media right now is an attempt to marginalize and minimize his campaign, for better or for worse or however you want to argue it, depending on your political slant - I'm an independent, but I think that that's wrong just because these guys might be running out of money.",
        "Now, there's a couple of different issues here.",
        "One is about the Obama campaign, the other one is about how news is delivered.",
        "But Patrice, when you think about the news delivery, is this just a natural evolution because of the rise of the blogger and the rise of opinion journalism, and should we just not be so sprung over the idea that there are fewer reporters on the bus?",
        "I think the rise of the blogger is definitely, you know, it's a positive thing that's coming out of the overall negative trend.",
        "I think there's a direct correlation between, you know, the lack of reporters and last week's story that newspaper advertising revenue is falling at a record rate.",
        "You're going to have, you know, more of these incidents of plagiarism, like I think the New York Times recently ripped off the Miami Herald, and it's because you've got more people - you're trying to do more with less.",
        "So I mean, it's very important to have those mainstream, accepted voices out there, you know, who you can turn to, because a lot of the time bloggers report from the heart.",
        "It's opinion-based writing.",
        "So you need somebody who's like, you know, the A.P.",
