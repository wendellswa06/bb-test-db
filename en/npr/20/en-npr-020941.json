        "Jasmyne, is there a constituency to push for more on-the-ground reporting?",
        "And what I mean by that is networks have been cutting back on the number of international bureaus, as have news magazines.",
        "I mean, there's been a general shrinking of the investment in getting first-hand reporting.",

        "Like that's a gripe that I have when you talk about cutbacks and all that.",
        "But one point that was made about like the mainstream media cutting back, you know, I also think it's important to understand that mainstream media, mainstream reporters, are also very biased.",

        "Daily News and the L.A.",
        "Times from the New York Times to the Chicago Tribune.",
        "And I think it's also important that you don't just have sort of those mainstream reporters but there is access to sort of, you know, the less non-traditional folks are allowed at the table as well, because what we haven't talked about in this conversation is where is the black media?",
        "You know, if it's $2,000 to ride on a plane with one of the presidential candidates, where does that put, you know, Spanish-language media?",
        "Where does that put the black media?",
        "Where does that put other traditional forms of media where we get our information?",

        "No country is more deeply involved than Syria's smallest and most vulnerable neighbor, Lebanon.",
        "Lebanese factions are fighting on both sides in Syria, and in a piece in the February 25th issue of the New York magazine, staff writer Dexter Filkins lays out the high stakes for everyone involved but in particular for Hezbollah, the powerful militia that fought Israel to a standstill in 2006 and fights now to support its ally in Damascus, Bashar al-Assad, and its patrons in Iran.",

        "And your piece is titled \"\"After Syria,\"\" but I have to ask you: Are we on the brink of a new war in Lebanon?",
        "Well, maybe.",
        "I mean, you know, when you're there, I mean Lebanon's such an extraordinary country.",
        "It's absolutely beautiful and an amazing place.",
        "But it's - you know, it's a very small country and kind of - it has Syria on one side and Israel on the other and then the Mediterranean.",
        "And so they've kind of always been - fallen prey to the machinations of their more powerful neighbors, and that's kind of what's happening here.",
        "You know, they - my piece was largely about Hezbollah, the militia that is supposed to be an anti-Israeli militia, that's how they style themselves, but they've been fighting with the Syrian regime (technical difficulties) and so the real concern is, is that the Syrian war is going to basically blow across the border either in a sectarian war in Lebanon or something even kind of nastier.",
        "And that's the concern.",
        "It's kind of holding at the moment, but really when you're there, it feels very, very fragile.",
        "And one of the problems, of course, is Lebanon, a small country, as you note, is swollen with Syrian refugees."

        "Yeah, and that's - again that's the thing, because if you take Syria and the war there, what's happened is it's become a sectarian war, basically.",

        "It's a Sunni majority country.",
        "Lebanon has the same, you know, Sunni, Shia, Christians.",

        "You spoke with one Lebanese Sunni who fights in Syria for the Syrian Free Army.",
        "And at least according to your reporting, the claims by Hezbollah that it's not fighting in Syria are ridiculous.",

        "It's ridiculous.",

        "The really - and in fact I went to a funeral when I was there, or a memorial service for these two Hezbollah fighters, and at the memorial service itself - and it was extraordinary, I mean it kind of reminded me of, I don't know, it's kind of a big, large, scary kind of event.",
        "But they were very fuzzy about where these people were killed, these two 19-year-old Hezbollah fighters.",
        "And somebody told us later on that in fact they had been killed in Syria.",
        "So we have it from Hezbollah themselves that they're fighting in Syria.",

        "Syria is absolutely critical to the future of Hezbollah.",
        "Yes.",

        "You could draw almost a straight line from Tehran through Iraq, through Syria, into Lebanon.",
        "And then of course to the south you have Israel.",

        "All the money comes from Iran, all their military hardware, all their missiles.",
        "They now have 50,000, an estimated 50,000 rockets and missiles.",
        "And all of that, you know, billions of dollars, and that's billion with a B, has come overland from Syria.",
        "So it's basically flown in from Iran to Syria, and then it goes overland into Lebanon.",
        "And so it's kind of - you know, it's the big link.",
        "And without Syria they're in trouble.",
        "It may not be fatal for them, but life is changing for Hezbollah in very unpleasant ways, and they kind of know that, and you can sense it when you're there.",

        "Yes, they are.",
        "Yes, they are, and I should say, you know, they're preparing - I mean they're deeply involved in the Syrian conflict, trying to prop up the regime there.",

        "It's been able to do that essentially with Iranian money and support.",
        "And that - it's basically Iranian money and support that built Hezbollah.",
        "And the key link has been Syria.",
        "So the big question that they're facing now is what happens, what happens if and when the Assad regime falls in Syria, what happens then.",
        "And this is not something they are publicly willing to contemplate, but it's clearly something that a lot of Lebanese are asking themselves.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "I mean it's one of these strange - it's one of the - and this is, you know, it's the Middle East, and this is kind of the way the Middle East is a lot.",

        "They live in Syria as well, and in parts of Israel as well.",

        "As I said in my piece, he looks like a spitting image for Edgar Allan Poe.",
        "But in the person of Walid Jumblatt you have almost the whole sort of tortured history of Lebanon and of their relationship with Syria.",
        "And as he said to me, you know, the Syrians - the Syrians came into this country, you know, 30 years ago on the blood of my father, and they left, you know, eight years ago on the blood of Rafic Hariri, who is the prime minister who was blown up by the Syrians.",
        "And I should - I'm throwing in a lot of history there, but basically the history of Lebanon, the recent history of Lebanon, you have basically two main elements.",
        "I mean you kind of have the growth of Hezbollah and the total domination of Lebanon by Syria, economic domination, political, everything.",
        "And Hezbollah has been Syria's agent inside Lebanon.",
        "So - and again, all that now appears to be kind of cracking because the Assad regime looks like - you know, it's still in power, and it may yet hang on for quite a long time, but it's been gravely weakened.",
        "And it's interesting, Rafic Hariri, said his assassination was meant to cow the anti-Syrians.",
        "It did the opposite.",
        "They rose up, and that's why the Syrians eventually were forced to leave Lebanon on the blood of Rafic Hariri.",
