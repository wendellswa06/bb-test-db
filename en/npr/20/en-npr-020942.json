        "On the front page of today's New York Times, news of a possible shift in how Arab and Western governments are helping the armed opposition in Syria.",
        "Sources tell the paper that Saudi Arabia bought weapons from Croatia and sent multiple planeloads of them into Syria via Jordan.",
        "The weapons began to reach fighters there in December, and they include assault rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars and shoulder-fired rockets.",
        "The influx of weapons is cited as one factor in the rebels' recent gains.",
        "At this point European and American officials decline comment.",
        "A spokeswoman for Croatia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs denies that the state supplied arms.",
        "Dexter Filkins is our guest.",
        "His piece \"\"After Syria\"\" appears in the February 25th issue of The New Yorker and focuses especially on what will happen in Lebanon, specifically to Hezbollah, if Damascus falls.",
        "If you've traveled to Lebanon recently, what can you tell us about the extent of Hezbollah's influence there?",
        "800-989-8255.",
        "Email talk@npr.org.",
        "And Dexter, you've described a military organization.",
        "It's also a political organization and a social organization.",
        "Yes, it's amazing.",
        "I mean, there's nothing quite like it.",
        "I should say that the only comparison to Hezbollah is probably Hamas, and basically Hezbollah, you know, which is Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah is an army that kid of dabbles in politics and is kind of a government now, I mean, it's own government for its own people, the Shiites of Lebanon.",
        "So it's an amazing thing to see.",
        "Like so in the 2006 war with Israel, you know, the Israeli air force just flattened, you know, much of South Lebanon, including South Beirut.",
        "They just leveled building after building after building.",
        "The entire landscape was rebuilt in the space of a couple of years by Hezbollah, not by the Lebanese government.",
        "It was rebuilt by Hezbollah with Iranian money.",
        "There's no doubt that Jeff Sessions intended to and in fact did destabilize the cannabis industry.",
        "And, you know, you go to the neighborhoods now, like in South Beirut, the big Hezbollah strongholds, all the buildings have been rebuilt, and the people will tell you, they'll say, you know, a missile hit my apartment building and it disintegrated, and, you know, two days after that there was a Hezbollah guy that came up, and he gave me money to pay rent for the next year in another apartment, and they rebuilt the house for free.",
        "And this is like really the source of their strength.",
        "They have so much money that they are - they're essentially more powerful than the Lebanese state.",
        "And so the people who are otherwise pretty poor, I mean historically the Shiites in Lebanon were the sort of downtrodden class, they love Hezbollah.",
        "You know, they - you know, they say look, if we wait on the Lebanese government to, you know, rebuild our apartments and pave our roads, we'll be waiting forever.",
        "And so it's really, it's a remarkable phenomenon.",
        "I mean, you can see how insidious it is.",
        "You have this armed group that's being funded by Iran, which essentially is, like, you know, taking over the - taking over the country.",
        "Just a remarkable thing to see.",
        "That guy you were talking about whose apartment was rebuilt is named Tsha(ph) in your story, everyone supports Hezbollah here, you quote him as saying: It's the only government we have.",
        "We don't mind the Iranians are paying for everything.",
        "I asked Tsha if his allegiance to Hezbollah wasn't costing him his neighborhood.",

        "I mean, much of South Lebanon was leveled.",
        "You had, you know, a lot of Israeli casualties.",
        "They were - I wouldn't say they were defeated, but they were essentially stymied by an Arab army for really the first time.",

        "Yet if Syria falls, those 50,000 rockets could be Hezbollah's last 50,000 rockets.",
        "Well that's really - that's the really interesting question, you know, what happens if Assad falls.",
        "And it seems inevitable that Assad will fall.",
        "I mean, you know it's - we're now two years into that civil war and probably 70,000 dead.",
        "But I don't - I mean, I don't want to predict the future, but it seems hard to imagine he can carry on forever.",
        "So suddenly Hezbollah's best friend and their next-door neighbor is gone, what happens?",
        "They're - you know, Hezbollah's, they're a pretty smart bunch, and they've very savvy, and they'll probably hang on.",
        "But it's not going to be the same.",
        "And it - I mean nothing will be the same.",
        "I mean, but if you suddenly in Syria have a regime which is dominated, as it almost certainly will be, by Sunni Muslims, as opposed to the Alawites now, that's a really different game for everybody but particularly for Hezbollah, which is Shiite.",
        "And they know that.",
        "And so this is why they're so worried.",
        "You know, suddenly instead of having a really good friend on the border, they have an enemy.",
