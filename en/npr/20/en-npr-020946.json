        "It's like the double edged sword situation.",
        "You don't want that kind of thing being said about your own candidate.",
        "It's one thing to say that about someone else that you're running against.",
        "But you know, is anybody ever ready to be president?",
        "She's being honest.",
        "I understand what she's saying.",
        "But at the same time, again, I step back into that communication director role, you don't want that kind of stuff out there.",
        "And you know, this kind of goes back to a larger issue.",
        "People continue to forget that, and you know, I'm an independent.",
        "But Barack Obama has had a lot of experience at the state level in the state legislature.",
        "I mean again, you're talking about someone who was the commander in chief's wife.",
        "Let's put this in perspective.",
        "…when it comes to disaster operations.",
        "They had just about the same amount of time in the Senate but he has a lot of legislative experience, and that counts for something.",
        "That's one of the things that Michael Dukakis was talking about.",
        "So - and him, himself having a lot of experience in the legislature et cetera, so...",
        "Before we wrap this up, in general it sounds like advisors really only get a lot of play if they've done something that doesn't really fall into the oh-this-was-great column.",
        "It's only when they get in trouble that we hear about them.",
        "Kym, does that seem right to you?",
        "It doesn't really seem right to me.",
        "I think that, you know, some of the policy decisions that a candidate makes or some of the great things that have come out of their campaign should be credited to the advisors that have been working with them.",
        "But again, you know, the bad publicity gets the attention.",
        "And that's pretty typical but troubling.",
        "I want to move on to Fisk University.",
        "That college, historically black college, boasts some stellar alums, including W.E.B.",
        "Du Bois and Nikki Giovanni.",
        "But the national school is also strapped for cash.",
        "They were trying to sell valuable works by American painter Georgia O'Keeffe.",
        "That collection was estimated at more than $100 million, but a Nashville judge squashed the sales plan.",
        "Fisk is officially forbidden from selling any of the pieces.",
        "Harry, part of the deal that O'Keeffe made with Fisk when she donated the collection was that Fisk wouldn't sell the pieces and the work would remain on display.",
        "Talk about the display issue in a minute.",
        "But if the work now belongs to Fisk and if Fisk really needs the money, why shouldn't the agreement with O'Keeffe be re-evaluated?",
        "Should it be re-evaluated at any point?",
        "Well, that's a really good question.",
        "I have a colleague, a good colleague by the name of Ray Winbush(ph) who is now at Morgan State operating their Center for Black Studies there, but he used to be at Fisk running the Race Relations Institute, and we were talking about this subject.",
        "And he calls the deal that Charles Johnson, who was president in the '40s when the donation was made, a deal with the devil.",
        "He compares it to someone being given a brand new Rolls Royce on the condition that they could never drive it, would have to keep it in a warm garage, wash it once a month, wax it four times a year and keep it insured.",
        "And it's a wonderful car.",
        "It's one of the most, you know, incredible marks every made, but you can't do anything with it and eventually it starts to drain on you.",
        "And his position is that when O'Keeffe made this deal, it was really almost like what she was trying to do was irritate the New York art world.",
        "Kind of like saying I have the Stieglitz collection, I can do whatever I want with it.",
        "In fact I'm going to give it to these black people just so you guys won't have it, just to show you what I can do.",
        "And on one hand it's great to have, you know, one of the most valuable collections of the 20th Century.",
        "But on the other hand, it's becomes quite, it's become, I wouldn't say an albatross but it's certainly become a hard thing for them to manage."

        "And when I was speaking with Ray, he said that he felt that in the '60s or '70s, when Fisk was a bit more secure financially, they should have gone to court and said that the initial deal was made under racial duress and used that as a way of getting out of this or renegotiating the terms of the agreement.",
        "Kym, when you hear Harry outlining all of these different stipulations and the back story of it, do you expect that at any point Fisk could go back to the table and ask for a re-negotiation?",
        "Or by this all playing out in court at this point is it pretty much a done deal?",
        "I think they should absolutely go back to court.",
        "And I was under the impression that the gift was made in two segments, and the first segment by Alfred Stieglitz was under the condition that they could never sell it, and then the second set of gifts by Georgia O'Keeffe didn't have that same stipulation.",
        "And I'm sure if they parse it apart and are in perhaps a less desperate situation, they'll have more power in court or the ability to negotiate that.",
        "But it's just to me - it's just so troubling that this collection has become a burden for Fisk.",
        "And what if, you know, in 100 years, Fisk no longer exists?",
        "What happens to the collection?",
        "It doesn't really...",
        "The Santa Fe Museum gets it.",
        "Yeah, there's definitely...",
        "So it's just a matter of, you know, keeping it on display and having this, you know, historic black college and the students look at this artwork instead of having it be, you know, a collateral or something, the ability to get money or make money from it.",
        "Well, you know, it's interesting.",
        "I think - not to interrupt you, Kym - this is kind of like a metaphor for much of the state of black America, like incredible, precious gifts but insufficient infrastructure to manage them.",
        "And then those things often, sometimes work against us or don't work in our favor or work for other people.",
        "Robert, when you listened to this case, do you think that it resonates with the larger issues of how historically black colleges and universities, despite having great alums, despite having a lot of support, just don't have a lot of the time these fundamental - if you think about schools like Harvard and Yale and plenty of other schools, there are these multi-billion-dollar endowments, and things are running pretty thin for a lot of HBCUs.",
        "What could turn that around?",
        "They are, and what needs to happen and what we have to be very cognizant of within the black community is that we need to make sure that we give back to the schools that gave so much to us."
