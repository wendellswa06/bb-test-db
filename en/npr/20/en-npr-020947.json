        "How important is the cost of a prolonged campaign for either or both of them?",
        "Well, it's extremely important because I think that what happened was that the Clinton administration - I mean, the Clinton campaign sort of bet the farm on Super Tuesday.",
        "Going into January, they were about at 18,500 apiece, and they were geared, actually, to spend most of that money in these states in order to come out with a stronger delegate count.",
        "The Obama people raised an enormous amount of money in January, $32 million, million dollars a day, and that gave them the capacity, not only to compete Super Tuesday, but also afterward.",
        "And so, I think that she's got to win.",
        "She's got - Michael is right, coming into March 4th, as the firewall, the scuttlebut is that if she doesn't do well on March 4th, there will be the drumbeat for her to get out.",
        "So she's got to spend that money that she's not raising very wisely, wisely enough to win some very important races on March 4th.",
        "Let me follow that point up with you - with this.",
        "The superdelegates are already an issue, as we've said, because if there is a brokered convention, their votes could be key to who gets the nomination.",
        "In fact, White House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has defended the superdelegate system, but at the same time, one of those 800 or so superdelegates, strategist Donna Brazile, has said - and this is a quote - \"\"If 795 of my colleagues decide this election, I will quit the Democratic Party.",

        "It's a big issue, and it really came up during the Jackson administration.",
        "I testified before the Rules Committee to have a one person, one vote.",
        "They put in the 15 percent threshold to get delegates, and they created the superdelegates.",
        "What they wanted to do is to go back to the smoke-filled room, because the party leaders, the party bosses felt that they didn't have a role in selecting the nominee anymore."

        "So what Donna is saying, in effect, that if the smoke-filled room is created, and particularly if it goes against Barack Obama - he may be in second place then - it will mean it would look very bad.",
