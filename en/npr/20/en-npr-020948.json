        "Louis joins cities such as Seattle, Chicago and Oakland that raised minimum wages above the state's standard.",
        "When the city's ordinance went into effect in May, the minimum wage for most St. Louis workers rose to $10 an hour.",
        "It was set to go up to $11 an hour in 2018.",
        "Then the state stepped in.",
        "The GOP-controlled legislature and Republican governor backed a bill barring St. Louis from enforcing its minimum wage law.",

        "Louis alderwoman Megan Green says state officials are not only making it harder for low-income workers to get by, but they're also needlessly meddling in the city's decision making.",
        "What we know is cities are incubators.",
        "And we're the first place that policy gets tested out before it expands statewide and nationally.",
        "Republicans like Governor Eric Greitens have a different perspective on cities with higher minimum wages.",
        "He's pointed to studies showing that Seattle's $13-an-hour minimum wage for some businesses led to employers cutting worker hours.",
        "Greitens is worried that businesses will flee St. Louis.",
        "And hollow out one of the state's biggest local economies.",
        "Despite the promises of liberal politicians and politicians in the city of St. Louis, the policy that they engage with would've actually had the exact opposite effect.",
        "It would've led to fewer jobs and lower pay.",
        "Dan Mehan is with the Missouri Chamber of Commerce, a business advocacy group that supported getting rid of St. Louis's minimum wage law.",
        "He says businesses are torn about what to do when the city ordinance goes away after August 28.",
        "Some grocery store chains and health care companies have said they'll rescind their pay increases.",
        "Mehan says some businesses don't have much of a choice, as they were already struggling to make ends meet before the minimum wage law went into effect.",
        "The problem is that, even though people would like to make more money and can do more things if they make more money, if they lose a job as a result of a wage increase, who won?",
        "No one.",
        "Jonathan Jones doesn't feel like his business is losing out because of the St. Louis law.",
        "He's the owner of Southwest Diner, a bustling eatery just inside St. Louis's city limits that serves up breakfast burritos and cornmeal pancakes.",
        "The St. Louis minimum wage ordinance required Jones to pay some of his tipped servers more money.",
        "But he says he's not going to reduce his workers' wages once the city law goes away.",
        "And, hopefully, the rest of the business community will also kind of follow suit.",
        "The more money that's in the pockets of the workers of St. Louis - it's better for business.",
        "It's better for the city.",
        "It's better for those people, obviously."

        "Bill Spriggs, one of the things that is interesting, and we saw Vicente Fox, the Mexican president's, comments not so long ago, talking about jobs that are taken up by illegal immigrants, specifically, and whether or not that is impacting on, in his words, `even jobs that African-Americans would not take.",
        "But let's talk a little bit about how, as the congresswoman just broached the subject, the idea that many of these jobs may start off as that, but, in your findings, do you see that it is impactful to others who want to find, who are legal citizens here, employment?",
        "Well, it depends upon how the economy is performing.",
        "The labor market is like any other market.",
        "It depends upon supply and demand.",
        "In the last five years, the labor market has totally underperformed.",
        "We have seen the slowest job growth ever in the history of the United States in those five years so adding additional workers in the current labor market clearly will have a detrimental effect because we just aren't generating jobs.",
        "We have really not generated any private-sector jobs.",
        "All the jobs that have been generated have either been in the public sector or as a result of defense expenditures in the private sector and we continue to lose manufacturing jobs.",
        "If you contrast that with the '90s, when the economy was booming, we were generating lots of jobs, despite record immigration.",
        "You still saw that African-Americans had the highest share of folks with jobs in our history and our highest wages and our lowest unemployment rates.",
        "So it really depends upon the economy into which we're dumping immigration and in the current economy, it is exacerbating a weak labor market.",
        "Sheila Jackson Lee, when we look at the idea that, according to Northeast University(ph), 50 to 58 percent of the growth in the labor force over the years, 2000-2003, was due to foreign immigration, legal and illegal, in terms of their sector in the job market, when we talk about juxtaposing it to what is becoming increasingly a tighter job market, is there concern of yours that we are going to see a battle, if you will, between those who are here legally, seeking gainful employment, and those who are here illegally?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You're beginning to see it now, in fact.",
        "In cities where there is a high concentration of immigration, whether legal or illegal, and in many instances it's predominantly illegal in some of the southern border states, tensions are rising in the African-American community, both professional and non-professional.",
        "That's why I say that there has been a failure in establishing a realistic policy on behalf of the (unintelligible) persons present in the United States at this time.",
        "Legislation that I'm offering, the Save America Comprehensive Immigration Reform, speaks to documenting individuals that are here.",
        "I'm not really that attracted to a guest worker program.",
        "The reason is because guests connotate `invite, come,' and, at the same time, it misleads because you ask people to come for a temporary job of three to six years and they have to leave if they don't have another job and I would think that they would not.",
        "What I'd like to see happen is get to know who is here, get them in line, give them the opportunity to access legalization, separate and apart from those that are already in line on a legal status.",
        "Then take the resources that come about processing these individuals, invest in American jobs, require American employers to sign an affidavit that they needed an immigrant worker over a non-immigrant worker.",

        "When an economy is structured so weak as this past years under this present administration, we have a real conflict and there needs to be real policies to address that.",
        "Bill Spriggs, let me ask you, with about a minute to go, are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future of, A, handling this situation along our borders, and, B, controlling it so we are not pitting African-Americans and other minorities against legal and illegal immigrants for jobs?",
        "Well, I'm slightly pessimistic because all of this immigration is a result of globalization gone wild.",
        "And if we in fact were shipping out American manufacturing jobs and creating a middle class in other countries we wouldn't see this massive immigration but we see us losing industrialized jobs in the counties from which people are fleeing.",
