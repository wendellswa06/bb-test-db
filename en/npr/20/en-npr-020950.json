        "And of course there was shockwaves in the entire country, led to great Republican gains in the 2010 elections.",

        "Well, there are a lot of - there are a lot of - I don't know what else to call them, but pro-gun conservatives who say that perhaps the tragedy of Newtown wouldn't have happened had the teachers been armed, had been able to bring guns into school and been able to protect themselves and protect the students.",

        "He nominated him for the Supreme Court.",

        "Representative Colleen Hanabusa, quote, \"\"possesses the intellect, presence and legislative skill to succeed him in the Senate.\"\" I think it's important to note that Governor Abercrombie campaigned for Senator Inouye back in 1959 and served with Senator Inouye with the congressional delegation for 20 years before becoming governor.",
        "So this would be his suggestion for an appointment, but Governor Abercrombie has a more complicated process than that to go through.",
