        "Yes.",
        "Oh, sorry.",
        "Anyway, but the point is, I mean, just tremendous amount of lack of influence that Hawaii has in Congress.",
        "And I wonder, clearly Wayne Yoshioka, the people of Hawaii are still mourning the death of Senator Inouye, but that loss of clout in Washington, that's got to be a factor in people's thoughts, as well.",
        "Well yes, and I think succession and seniority are not the top of mind for Hawaii voters, and it never has been.",
        "And that's why we ended up with two 88-year-old senators.",
        "But I think Danny Inouye brought to the table something more.",
        "I think he had stature not only as a person but as a war hero.",
        "He fought with the 442nd Regimental Combat Team.",
        "In 1944, that combat team rescued the 141st Texas Battalion.",
        "And when Senator Inouye went to Congress, he had two Texans greet him, namely Sam Rayburn, speaker of the House, and Senate Majority Whip Lyndon Johnson, both Texans.",
        "And I think his stature because of his 442nd combat record put him way far ahead of all his freshman colleagues.",
        "If memory serves, that was the most honored unit in the United States Army during the Second World War, and of course Senator Inouye himself a recipient of the Medal of Honor.",
        "It's a sad day for Hawaii, and we will talk more about the political transition there as it occurs.",
        "But Wayne Yoshioka, thank you very much for your time today.",
        "Thank you very much, Neal.",

        "Earlier today, President Obama announced that he's appointed Vice President Joe Biden to head a new task force and to report back with concrete solutions to reduce gun violence in less than a month.",
        "Asked by reporters at the Brady Briefing Room at the White House if he believes we can move on this issue given the passage of time and the power of gun groups like the NRA, he had this to say.",
        "The president also said this time the words need to lead to action.",
        "Well, call and tell us what your representative or your senator has said about gun control in the days since the shootings, 800-989-8255.",

        "And John, the president has re-opened the conversation about gun control.",
        "Is there a new shift, a new field for him to operate in?",
        "Well, what I think we're seeing is that there's always been three camps in the Congress: those who are strongly in favor of gun control; and those who are strongly against it; and then those sort of in the middle.",
        "What's different now is that that group in the middle seems to be growing a little bit.",
        "But there are people who may have been in the group against gun control who are now leaving the door open to doing something.",
        "At least initially that group in the middle that might have shifted a little bit seems to be mostly Democrats.",
        "We've heard from Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the U.S.",
        "Senator John Warner of Virginia as well.",
        "Right, although I understand that today Senator Manchin has walked back his comments a little bit.",
        "The last thing that I heard on that was that he stopped short of advocating for a specific policy.",
        "He said earlier in the week that he doesn't see the need for hunters to have assault weapons or high-capacity clips.",
        "And today he said that he wasn't advocating banning anything.",
        "So he is still in the undecided category, but he may not be taking the steps that he was suggesting earlier in the week.",
        "And Peter Overby, listeners may hear that and hear the footsteps of the National Rifle Association, which has been largely silent.",
        "It finally broke its silence earlier today, said it would hold a news conference on Friday but holds tremendous sway over many in Congress."

        "What that is we don't know.",
        "They're clearly on the defensive right now.",
        "They - you know, the tone in similar episodes of the past several years is that immediately there's an outcry, you know, don't politicize this immediately.",

        "Generally they're saying that this has been a national tragedy and that we have to take our time to evaluate what happened and how to proceed.",
        "Ken, over the past, what, almost 20 years, most Democrats have avoided the conversation on gun control after terrible defeats in the 1994 elections, when many of them blamed their losses on their positions to pass the assault weapons ban that many are now calling to be reinstated.",
        "Yeah, well, of course there are a lot of Democrats like Dianne Feinstein of California who have never backed away from calling for bans on assault weapons and things like that, or to reinstitute the ban that ended in 2004.",
        "But you're right, many middle-of-the-road blue dog Democrats- whatever's left of them - have been shying away.",
        "Remember, during the presidential debate this year, President Obama, I think when they asked about gun controls, his first answer was, I still believe in the Second Amendment.",
        "I'm a very strong defender of the Second Amendment.",
        "So Democrats have always - at least since 1994, have felt this to be a losing issue.",
        "And as Peter said, we've seen these kind of horrors before.",
        "It's always been an outcry then it goes away.",
        "Maybe this time is different."

        "A staff member also said that he's in favor of arming school teachers, which, to me, is ridiculous because with so many assault rifles in our population, we'd have to arm the teachers with the same assault weapons.",
