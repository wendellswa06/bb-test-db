        "The John Mica's and the Blunt in Missouri, they're against gun control.",

        "That's right.",
        "And the NRA, you know, hasn't tipped its hand at all about what it's going to say, just, you know, is offering something.",
        "In the past, is it fair to say that any measure to control access to either ammunition, to the quantity of ammunition, to any weapon barring a machine gun has been opposed by the NRA?",

        "But that's the history in recent years, yes, to the point that the proponents of doing those things have essentially given up.",
        "And that any move that might even sound reasonable in the aftermath of some horrible incident like this, the beginning of a slippery slope if we give up on this, then the next thing will be much more severe.",

        "I know you're just saying that he's one of those probably predictable senators.",
        "But the other senator from my state, Mark Kirk, is a pretty moderate guy, and I'm interested to see which way he goes if a bill is proposed mostly because they both represent Chicago, which deals with gun violence on a daily basis.",
        "So...",
        "And that's going to be - Andy, thanks very much.",
        "You raise a really good point.",
        "And Ken mentioned earlier, John Gramlich, there's going to be a lot of people - one tends to say rather cynically if you've been in Washington a long time, they will put their fingers in the air and see which way the wind blows.",
        "This, though, is an issue that strikes at home in Newtown, Connecticut, in a way none of us have experienced before, even though we've seen the horrors of Columbine, even though we saw just in the past couple of years the Sikh temple; Tucson, Arizona; Aurora, Colorado litany that President Obama mentioned the other day.",

        "suffer from IBD, which includes Crohn's, a condition that occurs when a person's immune system inappropriately responds to harmless cells or bacteria and destroys healthy tissue.",
        "And to treat the disease, most patients take medications to suppress their immune systems, but some don't work very well, and they can have really awful side effects.",

        "Well, yes.",

        "Well, the immune system is attacking the intestines, and it's mostly through cells called T-cells.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Well, you know, the immune system is attacking the bowel.",

        "Well, what can happen over time is as you get repeated bouts of inflammation, you form scar tissue.",
        "And scar tissue doesn't respond to medicines, and eventually has to be cut out surgically.",
        "Now, this genetically engineered bacteria, the lactobacillus - they were made to produce this protein LFn that reduced the inflammation in laboratory mice - is the same kind of bacteria that could survive in the human body?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "The lactobacillus have been around for many years, thousands of years, perhaps millions of years, and they are already, you know, well identified as being able to survive in the human body and thought to be, quote, \"\"beneficial,\"\" unquote, bacteria.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And it's just a question of testing this out, I would imagine.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "So the investigators did test it on human cells, like in a petri dish, where they caused them to get inflamed and then show that by giving them this bacteria, that produces the LFn that decreased that, too.",
        "So they've done it in live mice.",
        "They've done it in human cells."
