        "Well, I think that's been the strategy for decades, is the problem in one sense.",
        "So nobody is excited to have North Korea around.",
        "I mean, don't - make no mistake about this because of all the episodes like we've just seen where there's a big increase in international tension because of the provocations and their nuclear weapons and missile development and all of this because of the human rights violations.",
        "Nobody is excited about having this country as a neighbor and as a citizen of the global community.",
        "Even the Chinese, who are allied with them, a lot of this behavior has been deeply troublesome for China, such as the border issue that I mentioned.",
        "And that's the subject of this email from Joe(ph) in Minneapolis: How much influence does China have in North Korea's ongoing existence?",
        "If China turns it back on the country, would it not be much longer for the world?",
        "Well, it's a good question.",
        "I think that China's influence is a bit exaggerated because, basically, what China would be asking North Korea to do is say, please refrain from whatever action they're saying that they're going to do, such as a nuclear test or whatever it is or...",
        "That's the one that seems to be pending, maybe, we don't know.",
        "Right, right.",
        "Or we will cut off the energy or the food that we are now sending you.",
        "So that's the question in terms of, would that sway the calculations of the regime?",
        "Or if it doesn't sway the calculations of the regime, would the denial of those - the food and energy actually imperil the regime so much that it would collapse?",
        "And remember, the country went through a famine where maybe perhaps millions of people - a million people died, and the country didn't collapse.",
        "The government did not collapse.",
        "So clearly, the regime is able to sustain fairly desperate conditions in North Korea.",
        "So all that is a way of saying, China may have some influence over North Korean behavior, but we shouldn't say that if China snapped its fingers, North Korea would just do its bidding.",
        "There are others who say also China does not want a collapsed North Korea spewing hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, desperately poor refugees across the border, nor does it want the outcome of a North Korean collapse, which would be a unified Korea under the South Korean current administration and its ally, the United States, right on its border.",
        "Yeah, these are really important points.",
        "So back to what I was saying before about, well, what if the Chinese government were to deny these items to North Korea?",
        "Well, a lot of reasons why they haven't been willing to do that relate to what you just said, which is there's a short-term calculation of the instability that a North Korean collapse might cause if that did indeed occur.",
        "And then there's these longer-term calculations about how the gap, the absence of North Korea would affect China's strategic prospects, and the short term is very unsettling to think about it.",
        "We would have a situation most likely where if there was a government collapse, the public food distribution system in North Korea could well also collapse, meaning that there could be a humanitarian crisis in the country.",
        "And that could lead to a refugee problem, and China's already been dealing with the problem of North Korean refugees.",
        "And it's right on China's border, as I said, and there's - the province there for China is one where there is actually an ethnic Korean, a large ethnic Korean population.",
        "And so that China - the Chinese look at the situation of refugees streaming into a province of theirs already dominated by Korean ethnicity, and they see, basically kind of a Koreastan problem on their hands.",
        "So there's a big demographic component of this.",
        "But even in the shorter term, like I said, there's all sorts of terrible instability that could happen, such as a loose nukes problem, where North Korean nuclear weapons go loose, or nobody's quite sure where they are.",
        "Perhaps to mitigate that, the Chinese drop down south to look for them.",
        "The South Koreans, the Americans head north to look for them.",
        "And now, you have a situation where everyone's searching for North Korean nukes, and their military forces are getting jostled together on this small peninsula.",
        "So this is a really terrifying scenario.",
        "The last thing China wants is something that would invite that in.",

        "It - correct me if I'm wrong or if I'm misinformed, but it seems to me that, to a certain extent, we are overstating the case of the threat of North Korea.",
        "I mean, it seems to me that a society that is as dysfunctional that society is, can't really pose a serious threat.",
        "It's not on the economic footing of, say, even the former Soviet Union, certainly not China or Japan or the United States.",
        "So even though I agree that it would be extremely bad for North Korea to develop a nuclear (unintelligible) and link it to rocket technology, it seems to me that it's unlikely that they have the economic infrastructure to make that happen and certainly make it happen in a sustainable way.",
        "And also, when we respond to their failed rocket launches, don't we sort of give their regime ammunition to say, oh, look, the rest of the world is afraid of us?",
        "This is a great question.",
        "So Ray is reminding us about looking at the kind of overall balance of power in this situation and where North Korea lies within it, and this is a really good thing to always remind ourselves off.",
        "And North Korea is a very, very weak state, so its GDP is something like $20 billion a year, which is actually smaller than New Hampshire, where I live.",
        "And compare that to South Korea, compare that certainly to the United States, which have - which are far well wealthier, far more advanced military technology, thriving economies, part of this globalized world.",

        "If you look at the balance between North Korea and Combined Forces Command, again, North Korea is desperately, desperately weak, desperately inferior relative to CFC.",
