        "One question is about how many people were wounded.",
        "Palestinian health officials in Gaza said that more than 1,400 Palestinians were wounded, including about 750 hit by live Israeli fire.",
        "An Israeli military spokesman, though, said that was a complete lie.",
        "He claimed only tens of Palestinians were wounded by live fire and that other injuries were like from tear gas inhalation.",
        "Another question is, who was killed?",
        "Israel says those who were shot at were not innocent protesters but that they were terrorists affiliated with militant groups who tried to cut through the border fence.",
        "Hamas said, yes, five of our fighters were killed.",
        "But there are also some videos that have surfaced that appear to show some Palestinians getting shot when they appeared not to be posing any kind of immediate danger.",
        "And the Israeli army has dismissed some of these videos, saying, you know, that's only part of the story or some of them are fabricated and that soldiers fired only when necessary.",
        "And, Daniel, before we let you go, I want to touch on something you mentioned earlier.",
        "You're saying that Israel is vowing to expand its response.",
        "Tell us a bit more about that, and has there been a response from Hamas?",
        "Israel hasn't really specified what it's going to do.",
        "And an army spokesman told us that if violence continues on the border that it might hit at militant targets in Gaza that could be air strikes, possibly.",
        "Hamas, for its part, has said that it's praising the demonstrations that took place on Friday and showed that Palestinians are standing up for the cause.",
        "That's NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem.",
        "Daniel, thank you.",

        "He came in first in the Florida straw poll, handily beating both Texas Governor Rick Perry and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.",
        "It's a big victory for a candidate who up to now, has drawn little media attention, and placed fifth or sixth in many national polls.",
        "In a video message he sent to his supporters after the victory, Cain said that's changing.",
        "The Herman Cain train is picking up steam.",
        "NPR's Greg Allen has been watching Cain and the other candidates this week, and joins us now from Orlando.",
        "Greg, this must come as a big surprise.",
        "How did Cain do it?",
        "Well, surprise just begins to describe it, Audie.",
        "It was a big surprise.",
        "I think that although Herman Cain's not that well known nationally, here in Florida he's pretty well-known - I guess also around the country, to conservatives - as a radio talk show host.",
        "And he's filled in on Sean Hannity program.",
        "He's a very good speaker who fired up the crowd at several events over the last three days here.",
        "I talked to many delegates who said that they were impressed by his performance in the last few debates.",
        "They like his plain talk and his common sense.",
        "At an event that Cain held on Friday night, his staff had to book a new room because so many people turned out, they couldn't fit into the one they'd reserved."

        "So you have to keep in mind, though, that the 2,600 delegates who cast their votes yesterday are party activists, people willing to come here, spend their time, their own money.",
        "And that includes many in the Tea Party.",
        "Cain talks the talk.",
        "And here's a little bit of his speech yesterday, when he was quoting from the Declaration of Independence.",
        "Because it says, if you keep reading, when any form of government becomes destructive of those ideals, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it.",
        "We've got some altering and abolishing to do.",

        "All right.",
        "Well, Greg, what happened to Rick Perry?",
        "I mean, he's been leading in recent polls, including some that were conducted in Florida.",
        "That's true, but he hasn't really helped himself with his performance in recent debates.",
        "In the debate here on Thursday, he took heat, both from Romney and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, for his support of this Texas law that extends in-state tuition rates to children of illegal immigrants.",
        "I talked to many supporters afterwards who said that they were troubled by that and - plus, some seemed disappointed he wasn't able to handle himself with more confidence in the debate.",
        "Perry worked hard here to line up support.",
        "He held a breakfast for delegates yesterday before the vote.",
        "But he left town before the actual straw poll happened, and some delegates said that mattered.",
        "They only wanted to vote for those who were here.",
        "In the end, Perry walked away with less than half the votes of Herman Cain, and not too many more than Mitt Romney, who chose not to actively compete in the straw poll.",
        "Greg, Cain says that this win in the straw poll gives him momentum in the presidential race.",
        "But does it really?",
        "Well, it certainly raises his stature, and brings him to the attention to some voters who maybe hadn't considered him before.",
        "I mean, historically, the Florida straw poll has been an important indicator.",
        "Going back to the '70s in the first three that were held, the person who won - first, Ronald Reagan, then George H.W.",
        "Bush, and then Bob Dole - they went on to get their party's nomination.",
        "But of course, those candidates were all much more - better established than Herman Cain.",
        "So, you know, we'll see.",
        "All weekend, an issue that's been talked about is electability.",
        "Can a candidate appeal to the broader base he or she will need to win the nomination and the general election?",
        "I put that question about electability of Cain to Todd Catella.",
        "He's a Cain supporter from Orlando.",
        "He says that's why many Republicans here switched their votes to Cain.",
        "They think he can win.",
        "They want to believe in Herman Cain, but have been afraid to because he's been so low on the radar - on the national polls from the press and the media.",
        "But I believe today is going to make a statement that Herman Cain is a force to be reckoned with."

        "That's one precondition.",
        "So, you know, this will increase the amount of interest that we pay on the debt, but the real deficit problems are medium-term and long-term deficit problems, and we're going to have to get those under control once we've got the economy growing.",
