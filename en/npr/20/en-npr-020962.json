        "I don't know how they're going to be able to argue that extending permanently these high-end tax cuts is going to be good for our economy when, to offset them, we'd end up having to cut vital services for our kids, for our veterans, for our seniors.",
        "But I'm happy to listen to their arguments.",

        "How do these negotiations affect negotiations or talks with Republicans about raising the debt limit?",
        "Because it would seem that they have a significant amount of leverage over the White House now, going in.",
        "Was there ever any attempt by the White House to include raising the debt limit as a part of this package?",
        "When you say it would seem they'll have a significant amount of leverage over the White House, what do you mean?",
        "Just in the sense that they'll say essentially we're not going to raise the - we're not going to agree to it unless the White House is able to or willing to agree to significant spending cuts across the board that probably go deeper and further than what you're willing to do.",
        "I mean, what leverage would you have--",
        "Look, here's my expectation - and I'll take John Boehner at his word - that nobody, Democrat or Republican, is willing to see the full faith and credit of the United States government collapse, that that would not be a good thing to happen.",
        "And so I think that there will be significant discussions about the debt limit vote.",
        "That's something that nobody ever likes to vote on.",
        "But once John Boehner is sworn in as speaker, then he's going to have responsibilities to govern.",
        "You can't just stand on the sidelines and be a bomb thrower.",
        "And so my expectation is, is that we will have tough negotiations around the budget, but that ultimately we can arrive at a position that is keeping the government open, keeping Social Security checks going out, keeping veterans services being provided, but at the same time is prudent when it comes to taxpayer dollars.",

        "Some on the left have questioned - have looked at this deal and questioned what your core values are, what specifically you will go to the mat on.",
        "I'm wondering if you can reassure them with some specific things in saying, all right, this is where I don't budge.",
        "And along those lines, what's going to be different in 2012, when all these tax cuts again are up for expiration?",
        "For NPR News, I'm Anders Kelto in Cape Town, South Africa.",
        "Well, what's going to be different in 2012 we've just discussed, which is we will have had two years to discuss the budget - not in the abstract, but in concrete terms.",
        "Over the last two years, the Republicans have had the benefit of watching us take all these emergency actions, having us preside over a $1.3 trillion deficit that we inherited and just pointing fingers and saying, that's their problem.",
        "Well, over the next two years, they're going to have to show me what it is that they think they can do.",
        "And I think it becomes pretty clear, after you go through the budget line by line, that if in fact they want to pay for $700 billion worth of tax breaks to wealthy individuals, that that's a lot of money and that the cuts - corresponding cuts that would have to be made are very painful.",
        "So either they rethink their position, or I don't think they're going to do very well in 2012.",
        "So that's on the first point.",
        "With respect to the bottom line in terms of what my core principles are--",
        "Where is your line in the sand?",
        "Well, look, I've got a whole bunch of lines in the sand.",
        "Not making the tax cuts for the wealthy permanent - that was a line in the sand.",
        "Making sure that the things that most impact middle-class families and low-income families, that those were preserved - that was a line in the sand.",
        "I would not have agreed to a deal, which, by the way, some in Congress were talking about, of just a two-year extension on the Bush tax cuts and one year of unemployment insurance, but meanwhile all the other provisions, the Earned Income Tax Credit or other important breaks for middle-class families like the college tax credit, that those had gone away just because they had Obama's name attached to them instead of Bush's name attached to them.",
        "So this notion that somehow we are willing to compromise too much reminds me of the debate that we had during health care.",
        "This is the public option debate all over again.",
        "So I pass a signature piece of legislation where we finally get health care for all Americans, something that Democrats had been fighting for for a hundred years, but because there was a provision in there that they didn't get that would have affected maybe a couple of million people, even though we got health insurance for 30 million people and the potential for lower premiums for 100 million people, that somehow that was a sign of weakness and compromise.",
        "Now, if that's the standard by which we are measuring success or core principles, then let's face it, we will never get anything done.",
        "People will have the satisfaction of having a purist position and no victories for the American people.",
        "And we will be able to feel good about ourselves and sanctimonious about how pure our intentions are and how tough we are, and in the meantime, the American people are still seeing themselves not able to get health insurance because of preexisting condition or not being able to pay their bills because their unemployment insurance ran out.",
        "That can't be the measure of how we think about our public service.",
        "That can't be the measure of what it means to be a Democrat.",
        "This is a big, diverse country.",
        "Not everybody agrees with us.",
        "I know that shocks people.",
        "The New York Times editorial page does not permeate across all of America.",
        "Neither does The Wall Street Journal editorial page.",
        "Most Americans, they're just trying to figure out how to go about their lives and how can we make sure that our elected officials are looking out for us.",
        "And that means because it's a big, diverse country and people have a lot of complicated positions, it means that in order to get stuff done, we're going to compromise.",
        "This is why FDR, when he started Social Security, it only affected widows and orphans.",
        "You did not qualify.",
        "And yet now it is something that really helps a lot of people.",
