        "I would say most economists say there is not going to be much stimulus from the extension of those tax breaks for the wealthy in the near term, because they will save the money that they get back in taxes and not spend it, as will people in lower incomes.",
        "And Ron Elving, getting back to the point you made before the president started to speak, the era of triangulation may be back with us.",
        "In that last question, President Obama sounding more combative than he had at any other point in this news conference, saying: I want to speak to my Democratic friends.",
        "Yes, meaning those Democratic friends who are currently incensed with me because I have not stuck with the position they wanted me to go right past the first of January with, drive the car over the cliff and say let's keep fighting this, let's let the American people focus on who wants tax cuts for millionaires and who wants tax cuts for people under $250,000, joint filers.",
        "There are those who feel this is the time to join that struggle and see what happens.",
        "The president said his North Star - and this is the positive side of the hostage-taker analogy, the positive side is he said: Our North Star has to be the well-being of the American economy and the American people.",

        "You know...",
        "Go ahead, Ari.",
        "The president was pretty savvy in framing this as deal or no deal.",
        "Either we get the package that I put on the table, or we get nothing, and the taxes go up for every American on January 1st.",
        "I think there are people on the left who would say: You could have gotten a better deal than you did.",
        "You could have either gotten a permanent extension of the taxes for - the tax benefits for parents of students and things like that, you could've gotten something along the lines of the DREAM Act, the START treaty, the don't ask, don't tell repeal.",
        "And instead they think that the deal that the president got was far less than he could have accomplished in exchange for the two-year extension of the tax cuts for the wealthy.",
        "And in fact he was asked a question: Might not you have wanted to get the agreement to raise the debt limit?",
        "This is going to be a debate when Congress comes back in January, the new Congress.",
        "And this is going to be a debate that's going to be, well, fascinating, because some of the new senators in particular have said they will vote against raising the debt limit for the United States, increasing the legal authority to borrow."
