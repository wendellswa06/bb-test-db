        "It's convenient and quick.",
        "All Angela had to do was show her ID and write a check for the day the loan was due.",
        "She brought in a bank statement and a pay stub to get her first loan, but she's taken out a few since then - about two a year.",

        "And this is the heart of the debate behind a rule drawn up under the Obama administration that never took effect.",
        "The rule would require payday lenders to make sure borrowers are able to repay their loans.",

        "In a 2014 report, it found half of all payday loans are in a sequence at least 10 loans long with spiraling costs to borrowers.",

        "Under the current rules, she says...",
        "There's the possibility that some segments of the population don't have very good alternatives to the payday product.",
        "She says the rule would have posed an existential threat to the industry and some lenders had already shut down, anticipating the impact.",
        "Angela, the borrower I spoke to, says she's grateful the rule may not take effect.",
        "I'm happy that they have this.",
