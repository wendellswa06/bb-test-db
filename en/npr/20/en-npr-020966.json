        "That's right.",
        "So in this study, nearly half, or one in two, of the African-American adolescents reports at having one of the four STDs which they were tested for.",
        "And how do you account for that?",
        "We know that the societal and social context which affects the lives of many minority communities in the United States really have a tremendous impact on driving these STDs.",
        "Some of these factors, for example, include poor access to health services or poor quality health services, especially in urban or in rural parts of the country.",
        "And this is a major driving factor for some of the disparities we see.",
        "We also know that there are also societal factors.",
        "For example, poor housing, poverty, difficulties with socio-economic status, high rates of incarceration - these are all factors in the society which can facilitate risky behaviors or risky mixing patterns within the population that also results in high rates of disease in some population group.",
        "Any data on boys and their STDs?",
        "This study did not specifically address teenage boys or adolescent boys, but we have done other studies looking at STDs within young males and male adolescents.",
        "And in general what we find as a whole are - you tend to see lower rates of STDs or diagnoses among young boys, in part because of the different patterns of sexual mixing in the population.",
        "Young boys are more likely to have relations - sexual relations with girls in the same age group, whereas adolescent girls tend to have slightly older male partners.",
        "And this difference in the patterns of sexual mixing often results in different transmission dynamics for the STDs.",
        "These numbers - 25 percent - they seem high.",
        "Is this higher than previous studies that you've done on this, or is it in keeping?",
        "It's in keeping.",
        "In previous studies which have been done, what we've actually looked at are individual sexually transmitted diseases and looked at the prevalence of these diseases in the population.",
        "For this study we grouped these diseases as a cluster, so we're able to see the likelihood of acquiring any one of these four infectious diseases in the cluster.",
        "So this is the first time we are presenting the data in this format, but we have published other prevalent studies of the individual STDs in the past."

        "And can you also take away from the study the fact that teenagers are not using condoms as much as they should?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think there are number of things that we can take away from this study; first of all, the need for better education and open and honest conversations with our young people about sex, relationships, healthy relationships and lifestyles, which can really protect for their future sexual lives and sexual careers.",

        "Well, that seems to be the case.",

        "People always wondered why did Cabot go to Mecca and it was always understood that he was searching for the sources of the spices and the silks.",
        "And if you imagine some kind of plan that they were going to go over there and bypass all these traders, they needed to know where the sources were so that they could make contact with them on the other side.",
        "I - you know, you can't be sure about this, but that seems to be why he went and it's recorded that he was bitterly disappointed.",
        "He found that even in Mecca, nobody knew where he came from originally.",
        "They went from hand to hand, you know, across continents and oceans, and their origin was lost.",

        "Which he may not quite believed in his heart.",
        "But nevertheless, the disappointment must have been palpable.",
        "Well, I think - you know, you wonder why he got so ill.",
        "I think he was sort of holding desperately on to that belief in the face of his mounting evidence to the contrary.",
        "I think it would have made lesser a man ill and it certainly didn't do Columbus any good especially as, you know, all his investments had gone into it from the Spanish crown as well as from himself and he could see no way that it could be paid off.",
        "You know, it's a tragic story really because that was the beginning of slavery in the new world.",
        "Slavery, of course, was a business that all three of these men had been directly or peripherally involved in before they made their voyages.",
        "Yes, they were all involved in slavery.",

        "But they - you know, it's little known really that slavery really was quite widespread at that time.",
        "The point was - the rule was that you weren't really supposed to enslave other Christians.",
        "You could enslave Muslims or you could enslave Pagans.",
        "And what sort of emerged out of Columbus, his discovery was a new doctrine, which the Spanish crowned the Castillion Crown put together, which was that you shouldn't enslave heathens because you could convert them.",
        "And there were then this - it appears that, you know, the latest evidence about Columbus was that was preventing his colleagues from baptizing the local Tanos(ph) there, because it would prevent them being taken into slavery.",
        "So, there was tension as part of that.",

        "And I think it's really important to remember that he was also responsible - he and his men for the murder of up to three million Arawak Indians on the island of Hispaniola.",
        "And so, his history of introducing genocide to the continent is much more important than his dreaming capability in terms of - at least in terms of his ethical history of his legacy.",

        "Well, I mean, I think that's absolutely right, certainly it doesn't mean that he wasn't a dreamer, he certainly was a dreamer.",
        "But you know, these were dangerous dreams and dangerous positions that he got into and you know, a century later you had Spanish campaigners like Bartolome De Las Casas claiming that 40 million people had died in the New World because of the discovery.",
        "And these are really staggering figures and genocide is certainly not too small a word.",
        "And to be fair to the Spanish, actually the Spanish authorities did try, perhaps not hard enough, to limit the damage that was being done, which the English never did, they never did even try, I think, wherever there were discoveries, there was also slavery and/or brutality.",

        "The answer is that they had cracked the basic problem, how to profit from their enterprise and that is what is was, not a voyage of discovery but an enterprise of enormous ambition.",
        "This was a plan with the dream of fame at its heart, but it was also one that underlies their joint ambition.",

        "You know, I'm sorry I haven't read your book, but maybe you could highlight some stuff to the written record of the time and why this relationship for who came - who hit the shores first, is so, it creates more of this controversy.",
        "Well, I can't to some extent, you know, I think we can be pretty sure, where and when Columbus landed, though it's never quite sure exactly where he made land fall - still an going to dispute about that.",
        "The date of Cabot's land fall in 1497 on the mainland, and got to the mainland before Columbus in fact, it's pretty clear - though exactly where he landed again, it's a bit mysterious - he's never quite sure whether it was New Finland or somewhere further south.",
        "Vespucci is a far more elusive character.",
        "It's pretty clear now that a lot of what you proposed that he'd written was not actually by him and so we can't really blame him for that.",
        "But even what he did write was extremely ambiguous and was such - rather imaginative I think about his role in these things.",
        "And although it seems clear that he probably reached Brazil before the Portuguese and although on behalf of the Portuguese and some ways because he sort of changed sides halfway along the voyage, it isn't absolutely hear that - so, Vespucci remains the enigma that he always was, and yet he got the big price, you know, the continent was named after him.",
        "And that you argue was the product of map maker and not necessarily Vespucci himself.",
        "I think it's not Vespucci himself, I mean the famous book by him was not, it may have been included parts by him.",
        "But it's certainly wasn't' written by him and wasn't written with his knowledge.",
        "But it made him extremely famous across Europe - far more famous than Columbus, in fact everybody - thinking people assumed that Vespucci have been the discovery, discoverer of America from a European point of view for the next term, three, or four generations.",
        "And this book fell into the hands of enthusiastic, showed the first printers and map makers in Northern Europe.",
        "Out of which came this famous map in 1507, where almost exactly - we just slightly missed the anniversary of it which used the word America for the first time as far as anyone knows.",
        "So as far as anyone knows, that that is, is there - because of the reason that the map maker said which is that of calling it after Vespucci, because he was the discoverer and we're calling it after using his first name because it sounds good.",
        "Just like Africa sounds good, America sound after Amerigo, Vespucci sounds, sounds good as well.",
        "There are - I mean every nation has their own conspiracy theories about the name, just as they do about the discovery, and there is a sort of English conspiracy theory which is that in fact, it was Cabot got there first and Cabot's backer or as a prominent person in the Cabot expedition was called Richard Americk or Atmerick.",
        "And the thought was that Cabot called the place after his financier and came back but everybody forgot why and that this filtered through to the map makers.",
        "But it's very hard to prove that and so I think we have to go with - for the most likely explanation.",
        "Sorry, that was rather a long-winded answer to you.",
