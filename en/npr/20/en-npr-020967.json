        "Well, it's very hard and although I think, you know, compared to generation ago, there's a good deal more certainty about exactly who Columbus was.",
        "I mean, even, you know, in the middle of the century, the people were still arguing about that.",
        "Certainly who Cabot was, who you know, in the last 25 years we know a great deal more about Cabot and Vespucci as I say remains enigmatic - although we know exactly who he was, no difficulty about that, because he was a friend of Leonardo Da Vinci, a friend of Boticelli and so it's sort of interesting, sort of by, the sort of back story about Vespucci as far as that's concern.",
        "But it's some - the peculiar thing is that this vast.",
        "great and libraries of documents in Spain and Seville in particular is still, you know, coming up with new stuff even now, and of course they're very ambiguous, some of them.",
        "But the sort of crucial letter which revealed so much about Cabot which was written by, what appears to be an English spy to Columbus saying you know, I've been to one of Cabot's lectures, he's saying this, he's going back there and I'm going to pass you on the globe soon, and saying that the English have been doing these expeditions since 1480.",
        "That letter came to light only in 1955 with somebody was, it had been wrongly filed centuries before in Seville.",
        "And somebody found it and realized that it must be about Cabot.",
        "So you know, this is still an ongoing story, I mean in fact the latest information about Columbus, which has only just come to light in the last few years, which is the allegations against him for which he was arrested and sent back to Spain in chains, which is all the sort of cruelties that he and his brother meted out, not so much on the local Indians, but only on the colonists.",
        "With some kind of written record?",

        "They said, for goodness sake, take those off, but he refused, he insisted on carrying the chains all the way across the Atlantic and going in to the presence of Queen Isabela.",

        "Yes, he certainly felt destitute when he died.",
        "But in fact, he was a quite wealthy man by then.",
        "But the sad thing about Columbus was that he felt side-lined , he felt he had been betrayed and he felt that this great deal he had done with the Castilian states had been reneged on.",
        "And in fact, the king promised to investigate and found that this wasn't the case, that probably what he deserved under the terms of the deal was about a 50th of the complete profits.",

        "And it was used in Spain for about three times, really sort of honorary titles and one of the things that Columbus believed was that the other admirals could take a third of the profits on any business in their territories, which were very small.",

        "Well, the Columbian Exchange.",

        "But, if you want to see the bright side to all of these, what I felt about it by the end was, it's an extraordinary achievement in a way that in 1942 , they were using maps where Jerusalem was always at the hearts on where there were pictures of sea monsters and where the outside the immediate environment of the Mediterranean, you really had no idea what was there or even though you had banks which had branches in Florence, and Moscow and London and Navagraha and all those things.",
