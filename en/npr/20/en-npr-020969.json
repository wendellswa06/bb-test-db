        "Is that true today?",
        "Well, I think there - the consensus, to the extent there is one, is that Mike Huckabee had a good debate.",
        "He's had strong debates all along, actually, but this is his moment.",
        "He's doing very well in the polls in Iowa.",
        "Everybody is looking at him and wondering, you know, could he make it beyond Iowa?",
        "And so with that increased scrutiny he actually turned in a good performance last night.",
        "John McCain did pretty well too.",
        "Everybody else kind of came in in the middling category.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And then I guess Huckabee maybe stood out because he seemed not to be going for other candidates' throats the way Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani did.",
        "They were just going at each other last night.",
        "That's right.",
        "Huckabee looked reasonable.",
        "He also got some easy questions.",
        "You know, a former Baptist minister, he got the question about, you know, the literal interpretation of the Bible, and he gave quite a good answer."

        "Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, on the other hand, started the debate in a protracted snit fight, back and forth, on the question of immigration, in which they both looked kind of petty and unpresidential.",
        "And so it didn't do either of them much good, that beginning fight.",
        "This is when Romney accused Giuliani of running a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants and then Giuliani countered that Romney ran a sanctuary mansion, his own house, because he had hired illegal immigrants.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It gets into the weeds quite quickly.",
        "It was left to Fred Thompson to then note that Rudy Giuliani, who has had some trouble with Bernie Kerik, his former police commissioner, and other of his hires, was in no position to point fingers about other people and their trouble with people that they'd hired.",
        "Do you think, John, that these accusations, though, these sort of below-the-belt accusations, will stick?",
        "Well, I don't think so.",
        "I think probably voters think, oh, what a nightmare and why don't these two grow up?",
        "I think there is a little bit of a benefit here for those two candidates in getting in these back and forth fights.",
        "It reinforces the notion that it's really a two-person race.",
        "And for Mitt Romney, that's - there's benefit in that, because he's getting a lot of pressure from Mike Huckabee in Iowa and he's getting some pressure from other candidates in other states.",
        "And he'd really like to become the non-Rudy Giuliani alternative for conservatives who are looking for that alternative and at the moment seem to be picking from a number of different candidates.",
        "Was it interesting to you, John, that they seem to be more interested this time around in attacking each other than attacking Hillary Clinton?",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "I'm not sure whether the lack of mentions of Hillary Clinton - and there were a few, to be sure - but whether it was because she is having trouble in her party and is no longer the threat, or these candidates - and I think this is the answer - that these candidates have to scrape with each other because they are all in peril in one way or another.",
        "And they either have to knock the other guy down or try and build themselves up.",
        "And so that's the more frantic, immediate need.",
        "Well, speaking of Senator Clinton, her husband, Bill Clinton, the former president, has again been in the news for something that he said.",
        "And he said that he never supported the Iraq war.",
        "That is being contradicted today by the White House, which said, no, indeed, we had private conversations with him prior to the invasion and he supported it.",
        "Do you like the comparisons you mentioned, some people that you admire--Shirley Horn, Nina Simone, Nancy Wilson--just some of the names that have been thrown out in comparison as people try to describe your sound?",

        "Yes."

        "I think you'd have to give him quite a bit of either the credit or the blame, depending on your point of view about this bill.",

        "Came to the Hill.",
        "That's a big deal.",

        "He didn't just come to talk.",
        "He came to listen.",
        "And he did listen to the Republican senators and he agreed to add a $4.4 billion guarantee for more interior enforcement spending.",
        "That's very important.",
        "Not just border enforcement but also interior spending on enforcement to go after people.",
        "And that really seemed to have made a difference at least in giving people a little more cover so that they said they could go back to their constituents and say that it was an anti-immigration as well as a pro-immigration bill and that would be controlling the current situation.",
        "So aside from that, has the bill really changed?",
        "Not really.",
        "It's still the same basic trade-off between beefing up the border and having a legalization program for the 12 to 15 million people who are here now illegally.",
        "And it also has a guest worker program and some other changes.",
        "But it isn't basically different from what we've been talking about throughout this debate.",
        "Okay.",
        "So - wondering though, out there, you know, amongst the grassroots groups who have lobbied against it, is that going to change their minds?",
        "I don't think it will.",
        "No. I don't believe it will.",
        "The changes are enough to round up just enough votes to get them back to 60, perhaps.",

        "Speaker Pelosi has said over the weekend to Bloomberg News Service that it will pass the House if the Republicans will cough up 50 to 70 votes on their side.",
        "Now, there are about 200 Republicans in the House.",
        "Fifty to 70 wouldn't seem like that many, but given how unpopular this legislation is among Republicans, that might be too many.",
        "And so even if it got 40, I think it would have a pretty good chance of passing if Pelosi can get 180 for Democrats to go with it.",
        "And it's not clear yet at this point whether 40 Republicans are available, and it's not clear whether 180 Democrats are available when it really comes down to crunch time.",
        "We're going to have to see if either side can come up with that number of votes.",
        "Okay.",

        "It does.",
        "The bill, if they do pass it, if they do come up with the 218 minimum to get it passed, still has to go back to a conference with the Senate.",
        "And as we know, the Senate is just barely onboard for this bill.",
        "So whatever it takes to get it through the Senate might make it a little more precarious in the House.",
        "Whatever amendments have to be passed in the House to make it more acceptable and get those big vote margins in both parties that they're looking for, those amendments could make it unacceptable in the Senate.",

        "But basically, the test involves seeing how much pressure watching as pressure builds up within the well.",
        "And the well, as you recall, there's 5,000 feet of water, and then there's 13,000 feet of rock, and inside that is the well that's made of steel and cement.",
        "And they're not sure exactly what condition that well is in.",
        "But they've got this cap on top of it now, and if they can close off the pressure on top, the flow on top, the oil that's inside there and trying to come up will build, and the pressure will build up like, you know, pressure in a hose you turn off.",
        "And the question is: Is that well in good shape?",
        "And if it's in good enough shape, it should hold that pressure, and it shouldn't leak out.",
        "And if they see that the pressure is holding, they'll say hallelujah, we've managed to finally stop this."
