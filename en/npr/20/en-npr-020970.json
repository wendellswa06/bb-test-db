        "We now have a mechanism for the states to share that information with each other and with the federal government so that, you know, there can be some analysis done about where the threat is coming from but also so that states can protect themselves.",

        "But how successful, for example, were these hackers?",
        "So we only at this point know of one successful attempt back in 2016 to extract data from a Illinois statewide voter registration system.",
        "But I'm not aware of and nobody has made any public reporting about any other potential successful breaches.",
        "What has changed since election 2016 when election security became such a front-and-center issue?",
        "I think the biggest thing is a recognition that this is a primary issue for election administrators, where prior to 2016, in most cases, cybersecurity was an afterthought to the other mechanics of running an election.",
        "And I think there has been a big change in how it's viewed and that this is a primary point of planning and resource allocation in terms of maintaining appropriate cybersecurity."

        "So how many states right now don't have the ability to audit the vote?",
        "So yeah - so tomorrow, there are five states - Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, Delaware, New Jersey - that are using completely paperless systems in the election.",
        "And then there are counties and parts of about a dozen other states that are using paperless voting equipment.",
        "But about 80 percent of the country is going to be voting on a system tomorrow that uses - produces an independent paper record.",

        "And here's the reason.",
        "Right now, every year, the poor regulation of blood clotting - until you get it just right by doing repeated lab tests and adjusting the dose and lab tests and adjusting the dose - probably contributes to an excess of 85,000 bleeding events, which often would cause hospitalization.",
        "It also is implicated in about 17,000 strokes a year.",
        "These are the number of problems that would be prevented if we do this testing.",
        "And the estimated savings, even given the additional cost of the testing, was estimated at $1.1 billion a year.",
