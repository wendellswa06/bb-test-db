        "And actually, the federal government that has a lot of scientists involved in this brought in a few other people, according to Thad Allen, other scientists who hadn't really been involved before, and they asked questions that apparently the regular gang hadn't thought thoroughly about.",
        "And we I would've loved to have been at that meeting and get a sense of the concern that may have arisen there, but eventually, the decision was made to, well, let's just hold it for 24 hours and see what's going on.",
        "Obviously, you know, with oil spewing into the Gulf for more than 80 days, 84 days now, adding another half-day or a day of oil into the Gulf would be better than making a really bad mistake and really making it very difficult to stop the well a couple days hence, or whatever.",
        "So they said okay, time out, let's make sure we've thought of everything.",
        "And they asked apparently, they asked BP a bunch of other questions.",
        "They were satisfied by the answers, and they said okay, let's go again.",
        "And the new cap, how there was a temporary cap, and this is a new and better version.",
        "I know it fits more tightly on top of the well.",
        "Is that its only advantage?",
        "Well, that's it's certainly its most important advantage because the other cap was so leaky that oil was always spewing out, and they couldn't even if they had the best oil collection system possible on the surface, they couldn't possibly have gotten it all.",
        "This cap now does form a tight seal.",
        "Oil is still spewing out, but it's spewing out through vents that they can open and close.",
        "They can actually close the whole thing off once they have enough ships on the surface to collect the oil.",
        "Or as I say, if the well is in good shape, they can just close the valves and we're done with this nightmare or almost done with it, anyway.",
        "So that's a big advantage, yeah.",
        "And the relief wells, they stopped drilling the relief wells why?",
        "Well, one relief well is now only about five feet away from the well bore, and it has to go down just another 100 feet.",
        "It's going to go to it's almost parallel to it.",
        "So it's really close, but it's going to take this very shallow angle to do its final approach.",
        "And they decided on the remote chance that this pressure test, if that created ruptures, serious ruptures of oil down in the very well, there was some remote possibility that that oil could actually make its way into the relief well if they weren't careful, and then they would have to deal with possibly a blowout on the relief well."

        "And they said, well, let's just let's just, you know, park our drill bit down there, leave it down there so that it's there, we can pump in this heavy fluid that they use to make sure nothing can come up that they don't want to come up a well hole.",
        "So basically, they're saying we're taking a really brief time out.",
        "They actually used that time out to use that well also to run a couple of other scientific tests and learn a few more things about the well.",
        "So it wasn't totally wasted time, but it did actually delay by a couple of days the drilling of that well.",
        "And there's a backup relief well, also.",
        "Right.",
        "And that one, they had deliberately stopped already because one instrument that they use in order to hit this well, to find out exactly where it is, is they use very sensitive measurements of what's conducting electricity down there.",
        "And as you drill a well, you case it with steel.",
        "And so at some point, we said we don't want to start sending steel down towards, you know, from our second relief well because then maybe our sensors might get confused about whether they're looking at the second relief well or the well that they're trying to intersect.",
        "So they decided we'll just park it here.",
        "It's a nice, safe place to stop.",
        "It won't interfere with our operations.",
        "And the first one is almost there anyway.",

        "Well, shut it, attach one of the pipes we're using to bring oil up to the retaining ships above.",
        "Yes, well, in fact, that is the plan.",
        "If they can't just simply shut off all the valves and say okay, the well is now closed, and we're happy, they will open those valves again, and those valves indeed will be used then to convey oil to four different ships on the surface.",
        "Unfortunately, they're not all quite ready to go to collect that oil.",
        "So it would be better if they could simply shut the valves and leave it shut.",
        "Also, in the event of a hurricane, they would have to move those ships offsite at some point.",
        "So oil collection would have to stop entirely, and all that oil would end up spilling in the Gulf.",
        "So there's obviously many advantages to shutting off the well if they can.",

        "Yeah.",
        "He's...",
        "During this test, actually, they are not siphoning the oil.",
        "They are not drawing oil up to the surface because one thing they need to do for the pressure test is make sure that they're containing this, everything that's inside the well, and if you're letting some oil come out the side, through pipes, then you're not getting as good pressure readings as you want to get.",
        "So they made the decision that during this test, they would stop collecting oil.",
        "However, overnight, when they ran into trouble, and they had to they realized they had a piece of equipment that wasn't working, and they couldn't move forward with the test, they actually started drawing oil up again to the ships on the surface so that it wasn't really all spilling into the Gulf when they weren't running the tests.",
        "But we heard today from BP, that as the test progresses again, once again they will shut off those valves, not collect any oil and let it all run into the ocean while they're cranking down these valves.",
        "So I mean, there's obviously an environmental consequence.",
        "There's a price to pay for doing this test.",
        "But the belief is that the information from the test is valuable, and certainly, if they can shut these valves off permanently, then we all go home happy."

        "What is happening though is as the oil comes up and dissolves or enters the ocean water, a very substantial amount of methane does dissolve in the ocean water.",
        "And that does have environmental consequences, which is that there are bacteria and other microorganisms that like to eat methane, and as they eat methane, they also consume oxygen.",
        "And so there's a concern about how much of the waters in those areas are getting depleted of oxygen as a result of the fact that there's all this methane out there that's feeding the bacteria that also consume methane.",
        "And that is being studied by a number of scientific groups right now, and it's something they're concerned about and watching.",
        "Thus far, it doesn't seem to be mammothly widespread, but for many miles around the site, there is a depletion of oxygen as a result of the methane.",
