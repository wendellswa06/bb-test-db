        "NPR science correspondent Richard Harris is with us.",
        "He has been covering the blowout and its aftermath since the explosion in April 20th.",
        "If you have questions about the efforts to cap the gusher in the Gulf, 800-989-8255.",
        "Email talk@npr.org.",
        "Also with us is NPR national correspondent Debbie Elliott reporting from the Gulf, and she joins us from her home in Alabama.",
        "Debbie, nice to talk to you.",
        "Hi, Neal.",
        "And what are residents in the Gulf Coast seeing in terms of oil and damage?",
        "I guess it depends on where you are.",
        "It certainly depends on where you are, and it depends on what day it is.",
        "You know, the winds and the waves and whether or not a hurricane is passing can have a big impact as far as how much oil is coming ashore.",
        "But certainly, we've seen the heaviest impact in Louisiana, the heaviest, big, thick patches of oil coming in and getting into sensitive marsh areas.",
        "But then we've also got oil coming up on beaches in Mississippi, in Alabama and over in the Florida Panhandle.",
        "And it's scattered.",
        "You know, it might be in one area on the Florida Panhandle, and you walk 500 yards down the beach, and it looks perfectly beautiful.",
        "It could be small little tar balls, some the size of peppercorns, some the size of a softball or even a larger patch of more pudding-like substance is what they call it, oil.",
        "It doesn't look appealing like pudding, but it is oil that has come up on the beach.",
        "It also comes up with the Sargassum grass and the sea grass and the seaweed that comes in on the waves.",
        "And I assume we keep hearing reports about the number of people who have canceled their visits down to some of those resort areas and some of the people who are suffering as a result.",
        "Well, it's my pleasure.",
        "Right.",
        "You know, the beaches that would normally be packed, certainly packed for Fourth of July weekend, the peak of the season here this is a summer tourism economy.",
        "Everybody makes all of their money in the three summer months, for the most part, with a little bit of a fringe in the spring and the fall.",
        "But 40 percent occupancy rates is what I'm hearing from a lot of the real estate agents.",
        "You know, people just aren't willing to come down with the uncertainty of there being oil on the beach, and certainly health officials have said it's not a good idea to swim in the Gulf of Mexico."

        "So companies are trying to offer special discounts.",
        "States have been running ads saying please come, we need you, there are places where you can go that it's clean, there are other things to do.",
        "But you can't go fishing in the Gulf in a lot of these areas, and you can't swim in the Gulf.",
        "It's hard for people to make that decision to come, and certainly businesses are really, really hurting.",
        "Well, obviously tourists can't go fishing in the Gulf or most places in it, but that's fishermen, who make their living there, they're shut out of most of those areas, too.",
        "They are, but what has happened, and in fact, in a lot of towns along the coast, I would almost call it a BP economy has taken over.",
        "Charter boat fishermen where I am in Orange Beach, Alabama, just about all of them are now on BP's payroll, and they are out working for BP.",
        "Smaller boats are in charge of looking for oil sheens and calling and saying we've spotted this here.",
        "They are also out looking for oiled wildlife and reporting that to the right authorities.",
        "Larger boats, the big shrimp trawlers that you see that normally have these outriggers that drag nets to collect shrimp in the Gulf of Mexico, they've now got boom attached to those outriggers.",
        "And they're out skimming oil before it gets to shore.",
        "So everyone is, you know, trying to work to fight the threat that's at their back door.",
        "A BP economy, it's interesting.",
        "Do the people you talk to I mean, so much of the economy in much of those states, certainly in Louisiana, is dependent on drilling and production of oil and supplying the rigs and all of that."
